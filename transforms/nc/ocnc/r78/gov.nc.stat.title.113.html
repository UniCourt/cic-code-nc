                        The Wildlife Resources Commission is charged with administering the governing statutes in a manner to serve as equitably as may be the various competing interests of the people regarding wildlife resources, considering the interests of those whose livelihood
                        depends upon full and wise use of renewable resources and the interests of the many whose approach is recreational. Thus, except as provided in subsection (e), all special, local, and private acts and ordinances enacted prior to
                        the ratification date of the act creating this section regulating the conservation of wildlife resources are repealed. Nothing in this section is intended to invalidate local legislation or local ordinances which exercise valid
                        powers over subjects other than the conservation of wildlife resources, even though an incidental effect may consist of an overlapping or conflict of jurisdiction as to some particular provision not essential to the conservation

       Legislature Has Preempted Regulation of Wildlife Resources.

                    on wildlife conservation (e.g., an ordinance prohibiting the discharge of firearms from public roads). See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. H.T. Mullen, Jr., County Attorney, Pasquotank County, 51 N.C.A.G. 85 (1982).

                        any equivalent or successor statute. Noncriminal sanctions, however, such as license revocation or suspension, and exercise of powers auxiliary to criminal prosecution, such as seizure of property involved in the commission of
                        an offense, do not constitute different levels of punishment so as to oust criminal liability. Any previous conviction of an offense under this Subchapter, or under rules authorized by it, serves to increase the punishment under
                        subsection (a) even though for a different offense than the second or subsequent one.

                        the inspection is made; second, the warrantless inspections must be necessary to further the regulatory scheme; and finally, the statute's inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application, must provide
                        a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant. Where this test is satisfied and the public interest outweighs a minimal intrusion, the statute does not violate U.S. Const., Amend. IV. State v. Nobles,

                        reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity, was not a violation of U.S. Const., Amendment IV, and the evidence obtained therefrom could not be suppressed in defendant's trial for operating a motor vessel while impaired
                        (OWI), a violation of this section, where the intrusion on the defendant's rights was reasonable given the state's interest in recreational water safety, the reduced expectation of privacy in a boat, the brevity of the encounter,
                        and the lack of alternative means, and where the defendant's conduct was in "plain view." State v. Pike, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 532 S.E.2d 543 (2000).

                        The Marine Fisheries Commission and the Wildlife Resources Commission may provide by rule for summary disposition of live or perishable fish or wildlife seized by an inspector or protector. If the property seized consists of live fish which may again
                        be placed to the benefit of the public on public fishing bottoms or in public waters, the inspector or protector may require the person in possession of the seized live fish to transport it the distance necessary to effect placement
                        on appropriate bottoms or waters. In the event of refusal by the person in question to transport the fish, the inspector or protector must take appropriate steps to effect the transportation. The steps may include seizure of any
                        conveyance or vessel of the person refusing to transport the fish if the conveyance or vessel was one on which the fish were located or was used to take or transport the fish. When a conveyance or vessel is seized, it is to be
                        safeguarded by the inspector or protector seizing it pending trial and it becomes subject to the orders of the court. Transportation costs borne by the Department or by the Wildlife Resources Commission, as the case may be, may
                        be collected by the agency from the proceeds of the sale of any other property of the defendant seized and sold in accordance with the provisions of this section.

                        seasonal fish are those which command a higher price at one season than at another so that economic loss may occur if there is a delay in the time of sale. When ordered by the court, such sale prior to trial must be conducted in

                    The Department and the Wildlife Resources Commission may administratively provide for an orderly public sale procedure of property which it may sell under this section. The procedure may include turning the property to be sold over to some other agency

                    amount to offset the costs of sale, the Department and the Wildlife Resources Commission may provide either for destruction of the property or legitimate utilization of the property by some public agency.

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 1993 (Reg. Sess., 1994), c. 576, ss. 3 to 6 provided for a moratorium on the issuance of new licenses under G.S. 113-152, 113-153.1, 113-154, and 113-154.1, effective July 1, 1994, until June 30, 1996, with
                    certain exceptions. Renewal of licenses on and after June 1, 1993, under G.S. 113-152, 113-154 and 113-154.1 was allowed. The act created an appeals panel to consider license applications. It provided for a study of the fishing industry,
                    and for a quarterly report to the Joint Legislative Commission on Seafood and Aquaculture and the Marine Fisheries Commission. In addition, the act limited the authority of the Marine Fisheries Commission during the moratorium.

                    The date on the moratorium created by Session Laws 1993 (Reg. Sess., 1994), c. 576, ss. 3 to 6 was extended to August 15, 1997, and additional amendments and modifications were made by the following acts: Session Laws 1993 (Reg. Sess., 1994), c. 675,
                    s. 3; c. 769, s. 17.7 (b); c. 770, s. 1; 1995, c. 507, s. 26.5; 1997-256, s. 7; 1997-347, s. 3; 1997-400, ss. 6.1, 6.2, 6.10; 1997-401, ss. 3, 6.1; 1998-212, s. 14.2.

                    "(c) Temporary Cap. There is hereby imposed a temporary cap on the total number of SCFLs that the Division may issue. The temporary cap equals the total number of endorsements to sell fish that establish eligibility for a SCFL under subsection (g) of
                    this section plus 500 additional SCFLs, authorized by subsection (d) of this section.

                    "(f) Adjustment of Number of SCFLs. The number of SCFLs in the pool of available SCFLs in license years beginning with the 2000-01 license year is the temporary cap less the number of SCFLs that were issued and renewed during the previous year. The Commission
                    may increase or decrease the number of SCFLs that are issued from the pool of available SCFLs. The Commission may increase the number of SCFLs that are issued from the pool of available SCFLs up to the temporary cap. The Commission
                    may decrease the number of SCFLs that are issued from the pool of available SCFLs but may not refuse to renew a SCFL that is issued during the previous license year and that has not been suspended or revoked. The Commission shall increase
                    or decrease the number of SCFLs that are issued to reflect its determination as to the effort that the fishery can support, based on the best available scientific evidence.

                    "(3) Enhancement of oyster habitat restoration. - The General Assembly finds that the lack of a reliable State-based supply of oyster seed and inadequate funding for cultch planting are limitations to the expansion of oyster harvesting and the restoration
                    of wild oyster habitat in North Carolina. Therefore, the plan should include the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "a. Provisions and recommendations to facilitate the availability of oyster seed produced in North Carolina for wild oyster habitat restoration projects as well as oyster aquaculture and to reduce potential negative impacts from importation of non-native
                    oyster seed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "b. Plans, where feasible, for public-private partnerships for State-based production of viable oyster seed through the creation of one or more production hatcheries and recommendations for increased support of the existing research hatchery at UNC-Wilmington.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "c. Plans and cost estimates for an expansion of cultch planting in suitable areas of the State's coastal waters in order to expand areas suitable for development of wild oyster habitat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Economic relief. - The plan should consider a waiver of application fees and yearly rental fees for new shellfish leases for an established period of time to further promote and support shellfish aquaculture in North Carolina. The new leasing fee
                    waiver program should include measures to discourage speculation and target persons with a genuine interest in starting a shellfish aquaculture business, such as a requirement that the lease be nontransferable for a five-year period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) Outreach. - The plan should include outreach and education that promotes, whenever possible, public-private partnerships utilizing the Sea Grant College Program, local colleges, and other nongovernmental organizations to (i) encourage shellfish aquaculture
                    and provide technical assistance to broaden cost-effective technologies available to leaseholders; (ii) encourage best management practices to leaseholders; and (iii) inform fishermen and the public on the benefits provided by the
                    Senator Jean Preston Oyster Sanctuary Network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) Monitoring. - The plan should include a monitoring plan designed to (i) determine the success of oyster reef construction and (ii) evaluate the cost benefit of the oyster sanctuary network and harvestable enhancement sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) Funding. - The plan should include a request for appropriations sufficient for Division staff to expand oyster restoration and monitoring activities for 10 years. The plan should provide that, whenever possible, public-private partnerships are employed
                    to meet the construction, seeding, and outreach requirements of the plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(8) Recommendations. - The plan shall include recommendations for statutory or regulatory changes needed to expedite the expansion of shellfish restoration and harvesting in order to improve water quality, restore ecological habitats, provide enhanced
                    recreational and commercial fishing opportunities, and expand the coastal economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(9) No funding for sanctuaries in closed areas. - The plan shall provide that no funding or other resources shall be available in water bodies where a moratorium or other legal prohibition on shellfish leasing under Article 16 of
                    <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.113.html" target="_blank">Chapter 113</a></cite> of the General Statutes is currently in effect. This subdivision does not apply to leasing moratoria imposed because the area is closed
                    to shellfish harvesting or recommended for closure by the State Health Director due to pollution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(c) No later than March 1, 2016, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources shall report to the Chairs of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on Agriculture and Natural and Economic Resources, the Senate Appropriations Committee
                    on Natural and Economic Resources, and the Fiscal Research Division regarding its implementation of this section and its recommended plan."

                    Within 30 days of final termination of the leasehold, the former leaseholder shall remove all abandoned gear and markers denominating the area of the leasehold as a private bottom. The State may, after 10 days' notice to the owner of the abandoned gear
                    and markers thereof, remove the abandoned structure and have the area cleaned up. The cost of such removal and cleanup shall be payable by the owner of the abandoned gear and markers and the State may bring suit to recover the costs

                    The General Assembly declares it to be contrary to public policy to the oyster and clam bottoms which were leased prior to January 1, 1966, and which are not being used to produce oysters and clams in commercial quantities to continue to be held by private
                    individuals, thus depriving the public of a resource which belongs to all the people of the State. Therefore, when the Secretary determines, after due notice to the lessee, and after opportunity for the lessee to be heard, that oysters
                    or clams are not being produced in commercial quantities, due to the lessee's failure to make diligent effort to produce oysters and clams in commercial quantities, the Secretary may decline to renew, at the end of the current term,
                    any oyster or clam bottom lease which was executed prior to January 1, 1966. The lessee may appeal the denial of the Secretary to renew the lease by initiating a contested case pursuant to G.S. 150B-23. In such contested cases, the
                    burden of proof, by the greater weight of the evidence, shall be on the lessee.

                        Riparian rights are vested property rights that cannot be taken for private or public purposes without compensating the owner, and they arise out of ownership of land bounded or traversed by navigable water. In re Mason ex rel. Huber,

                        Lease Constitutes Contract That May Not Be Abrogated by Subsequent Statute. - While there is no vested right in the provisions of a statute, where a person has leased the bottom of waters from the State for oyster beds pursuant to former law, the lease
                        constitutes a contract between the lessee and the State, and the State may not by subsequent statute abrogate the terms of the contract, either as to duration and renewals or the amount of rent. Oglesby v. Adams,
                        <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 272</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 383 (1966).

                        Requested Fee Increase After First Renewal Term Permissible. - Where plaintiff and State, parties to a lease of oyster bottoms, did not intend to create a perpetual lease, a third renewal of the lease was within the discretion of the State, and a requested
                        increase in the rental fee, pursuant to this section, after the first renewal term had ended, was constitutionally permissible and did not impair the State's obligation of its lease contract with plaintiff. Oglesby v. McCoy,

                        Lease May Not Impinge upon Riparian Rights. - The Legislature vested the authority to promote the shellfish industry in the Marine Fisheries Commission, but it also mandated that the Commission may not lease a bottom area if the lease would impinge upon
                        riparian rights. In re Mason ex rel. Huber, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 337 S.E.2d 99 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 588</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 27 (1986).

                        Lease for shellfish cultivation issued under this section did not infringe upon the riparian rights of the landowner. In re Mason ex rel. Huber, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 337 S.E.2d 99 (1985), cert. denied,

                    <p>
                        Findings Prerequisite to Lease. - As the Commission's regulations define the term "natural shellfish bed" as an area of public bottom where 10 bushels or more of shellfish per acre are found to be growing, and this section specifically requires that the
                        Commission's regulations, as well as the statutory requirements, be followed in conducting an investigation and in making the determination of acceptability of a proposed site under subsection (a) of this section, before a lease
                        may be approved there must be a finding under the Commission's regulatory standards that the site contains less than 10 bushels of shellfish per acre. In re Mason ex rel. Huber, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite>                        16, 337 S.E.2d 99 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 588</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 27 (1986).

                    <p>
                        This section requires an investigation to determine whether a natural shellfish bed exists within the bounds of the area proposed to be leased. In re Mason ex rel. Huber, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 337 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Survey Required. - Without the results of a proper and timely survey, the Commission's regulations and the minimum requirements of this section cannot be satisfied. In re Mason ex rel. Huber, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite>                        16, 337 S.E.2d 99 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 588</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 27 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Commission May Not Adopt One Standard But Apply Another. - The Commission may not adopt in its regulations one standard (an objective "10 bushels per acre" standard) and then apply another (a subjective standard that considers an area's substrate, vegetation
                        and wind exposure). In re Mason ex rel. Huber, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 337 S.E.2d 99 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 588</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 27 (1986).

                        Planting Must Await Determination. - To allow the unauthorized planting of artificial beds before investigations, and then conclude that there must be no natural beds at the mat-obstructed sites, would defeat the purpose of this section. Clearly, the
                        planting must await the determination of the absence of a natural bed; otherwise, the determination is a foregone conclusion. In re Mason ex rel. Huber, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 337

                        Navigable Waters. - If a body of water in its natural condition can be navigated by watercraft, it is navigable in fact and, therefore, navigable in law, even if it has not been used for such purpose. Lands lying beneath such waters that are navigable
                        in law are the subject of the public trust doctrine. Gwathmey v. State ex rel. Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 287</cite>, 464 S.E.2d 674 (1995).

                        as they are renewed under the provisions of this Article, the locations of all claims of grant of title to portions of the bed under navigable waters registered with him, and the locations of all areas in navigable waters to which
                        a right of private fishery is claimed and registered with him. Charting or registering any claim by the Secretary in no way implies recognition by the State of the validity of the claim.

                        If a claim is based on an oyster or other shellfish grantor a perpetual franchise for shellfish cultivation, the Secretary may, to resolve the claim, grant a shellfish lease to the claimant for part or all of the area claimed. If a claim of exclusive
                        shellfishing rights was registered based upon a conveyance by the Literary Fund, the North Carolina Literary Board or the State Board of Education, and the claimant shows that the area had been cultivated by the claimant or his
                        predecessor in title for the seven-year period prior to registration of the claim, the Secretary may, to resolve the claim, grant a shellfish lease to the claimant for all or part of the area claimed, not to exceed ten acres. A
                        shellfish lease granted under this subsection is subject to the restrictions imposed on shellfish leases in G.S. 113-202, except the prohibition against leasing an area that contains a natural shellfish bed in G.S. 113-202(a)(2).
                        This restriction is waived because, due to the cultivation efforts of the claimant, the area is likely to contain a natural shellfish bed.

                        as for a lease applicant as to which there is a recommendation of denial or modification of lease. If there is no appeal, or upon settlement of the issue upon appeal, the modified leases must be approved by the Marine Fisheries
                        Commission and reissued by the Secretary in the same manner as initial or renewal leases. Leaseholders must furnish the Secretary surveys of the modified leasehold areas, meeting the requisite criteria for surveys established by

                        engaged in the production of oysters or clams in commercial quantities who received the lease with no notice of the existence of any claimed grant or right of fishery. To this end, the Secretary shall cause a modification of the
                        claim registered with him and its accompanying survey to exclude the leasehold area. Such modification effected by the Secretary has the effect of voiding the grant of title or right of fishing to the extent indicated.

                        with the Secretary. In such proceeding, the burden of showing title or right of fishery, by the preponderance of the evidence, shall be upon the claiming title or right holder. In the event the claiming title or right holder prevails,
                        the trier of fact shall fix the monetary worth of the claim. The Department may elect to condemn the claim upon payment of the established owners or right holders their pro rata shares of the amount so fixed. The Department may
                        make such payments from such funds as may be available to it. An appeal lies to the appellate division by either party both as to the validity of the claim and as to the fairness of the amount fixed. The Department in such actions
                        may be represented by the Attorney General. In determining the availability of funds to the Department to underwrite the costs of litigation or make condemnation payments, the use which the Department proposes to make of the area

                        Initial leases begin upon the issuance of the lease by the Secretary and expire at noon on the first day of July following the twentieth anniversary of the granting of the lease. Renewal leases are issued for a period of 20 years from the time of expiration
                        of the previous lease. At the time of making application for renewal of a lease, the applicant must pay a filing fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00). The rental for initial leases and renewed leases is two hundred ten dollars
                        ($210.00) per acre, per year. Rental must be paid annually in advance prior to the first day of April each year. Upon initial granting of a lease, the pro rata amount for the portion of the year left until the first day of July

       Study Penalties Associated with Violations of Laws Regarding Taking Shellfish and Shellfish Aquaculture Operations.

                        The Marine Fisheries Commission may delegate to the Fisheries Director the authority to issue proclamations suspending or implementing, in whole or in part, particular rules of the Commission that may be affected by variable conditions. These proclamations
                        shall be issued by the Fisheries Director or by a person designated by the Fisheries Director. Except as provided in this subsection, all proclamations shall state the hour and date upon which they become effective and shall be
                        issued at least 48 hours in advance of the effective date and time. A proclamation that prohibits the taking of certain fisheries resources for reasons of public health or that governs a quota-managed fishery may be made effective
                        immediately upon issuance. A proclamation to reopen the taking of certain fisheries resources closed for reasons of public health shall be issued at least 12 hours in advance of the effective date and time of the reopening. A person
                        who violates a proclamation that is made effective immediately upon issuance shall not be charged with a criminal offense for the violation if the violation occurred between the time of issuance and 48 hours after the issuance
                        and the person did not have actual notice of the issuance of the proclamation. Fisheries resources taken or possessed by any person in violation of any proclamation may be seized regardless of whether the person had actual notice
                        of the proclamation. A permanent file of the text of all proclamations shall be maintained in the office of the Fisheries Director. Certified copies of proclamations are entitled to judicial notice in any civil or criminal proceeding.
                        The Fisheries Director shall make every reasonable effort to give actual notice of the terms of any proclamation to persons who may be affected by the proclamation. Reasonable effort includes a press release to communications media,
                        posting of a notice at docks and other places where persons affected may gather, personal communication by inspectors and other agents of the Fisheries Director, and other measures designed to reach the persons who may be affected.
                        It is a defense to an enforcement action for a violation of a proclamation that a person was prevented from receiving notice of the proclamation due to a natural disaster or other act of God occasioned exclusively by violence of
                        nature without interference of any human agency and that could not have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of due care or foresight.

                        delegated to the Fisheries Director pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or to review the desirability of directing the Fisheries Director to issue a proclamation to prohibit or allow the taking of certain fisheries resources.

                    To the extent that the Department is granted authority in this Subchapter over subject matter as to which there is concurrent federal jurisdiction, the Marine Fisheries Commission in its discretion may by reference in its rules adopt relevant provisions
                    of federal laws and regulations as State rules. To prevent confusion or conflict of jurisdiction in enforcement, the Marine Fisheries Commission is exempt from any conflicting limitations in G.S. 150B-21.6 so that it may provide for
                    automatic incorporation by reference into its rules of future changes within any particular set of federal laws or regulations relating to some subject clearly within the jurisdiction of the Department.

                        publication in accordance with the rules of the Commission shall serve to satisfy the notification requirement. An owner may file written objections to the permit with the Department for 30 days after the owner is served with a

                        might be affected by the project so that such agencies will have an opportunity to raise any objections they might have. The Department may deny an application for a dredge or fill permit upon finding: (1) that there will be significant
                        adverse effect of the proposed dredging and filling on the use of the water by the public; or (2) that there will be significant adverse effect on the value and enjoyment of the property of any riparian owners; or (3) that there

                        effect on wildlife or fresh water, estuarine or marine fisheries. In the absence of such findings, a permit shall be granted. Such permit may be conditioned upon the applicant amending his proposal to take whatever measures are

                        the project dimensions as found in the permit granted. The Department shall act on an application for permit within 75 days after the completed application is filed, provided the Department may extend such deadline by not more
                        than an additional 75 days if necessary properly to consider the application, except for applications for a special emergency permit, in which case the Department shall act within two working days after an application is filed,

                        structure. The Coastal Resources Commission may elaborate by rule upon what conditions the Secretary may issue a special emergency dredge or fill permit. The Secretary may condition the emergency permit upon any reasonable conditions,
                        consistent with the emergency situation, he feels are necessary to reasonably protect the public interest. Where an application for a special emergency permit includes work beyond which the Secretary, in his discretion, feels necessary
                        to reduce imminent dangers to life or property he shall issue the emergency permit only for that part of the proposed work necessary to reasonably reduce the imminent danger. All further work must be applied for by application

                        factors in G.S. 113-229(e) clearly outweighs the detriment to the applicant if such permit application should be denied.

                        is a constitutional exercise of the police power since the denial of a permit where either the water or adjacent private property will be adversely affected is a matter of public interest and is therefore a proper subject for regulatory
                        legislation, the permit application system created by this section is the most feasible and reasonable manner to control dredging and filling activities, and the restriction placed on a landowner is reasonable because it relates
                        only to what the owner may do in the State's estuarine waters and does not interfere with the owner's right to use his own property. In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>,
                        266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).

                    <p>
                        Right to Trial by Jury. - The Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) provides for a trial by jury only where a party owning land affected by a final decision of the Coastal Resources Commission petitions the superior court alleging a taking; there is no other
                        statutory authority in CAMA, nor in the Dredge and Fill Act, granting a right to trial by jury. State ex rel. Rhodes v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 514</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 329 (1989).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in granting defendant's demand for a jury trial in state-initiated proceeding seeking mandatory injunctive relief under Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) and the Dredge and Fill Act for the removal of fill material on defendant's property;
                        since such an action neither existed at common law nor by statute at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, N.C. Const., Art. I,

                    <p>
                        Permit Applications Reviewed Prospectively. - The statutory purpose can only be effected by reviewing a project prior to its completion. A request by the Department of the applicant to file an "after-the-fact" application for a permit defies the logic
                        and purpose of the statute. Permit applications must be reviewed prospectively, taking into consideration the work already completed. In re Milliken, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 258 S.E.2d
                        856 (1979).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Denial of permits under clause (2) of subsection (e) is proper only when there is evidence that the adjacent riparian landowners have been adversely affected in their enjoyment of those resources, and not when the adverse effect relates solely to the
                        enjoyment and value of their own property. In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The restriction of clause (2) of subsection (e) of this section is not a restriction regarding what a landowner may do with his own land but is concerned with what a landowner adjacent to estuarine resources may do as far as dredging and filling in those
                        waters when an adjacent landowner will be adversely affected in the enjoyment and value of his land. In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645
                        (1980).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In determining whether to deny an application for a dredge and fill permit in estuarine waters on the ground that there would be a significant adverse effect on the value and enjoyment of the property of riparian owners, the review commission was not
                        limited to a consideration only of the effects of the dredging and filling itself on adjacent landowners but could properly consider the effects of a boat ramp which was the ultimate purpose of the dredge and fill work. In re Broad
                        &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In determining whether to deny an application for a dredge and fill permit in estuarine waters on the ground that there would be a significant adverse effect on the value and enjoyment of the property of riparian owners, even if the review commission
                        exceeded its statutory authority in considering the effects of a boat ramp which was the ultimate purpose of the dredge and fill work, the commission's denial of a dredge and fill permit would still be upheld where the application
                        stated that the fill from the dredging operation would be placed on the roadbed leading to the boat ramp site; the riparian owners presented evidence that the roadbed has already suffered erosion, that erosion will continue unless
                        adequate drainage measures which the applicant did not propose are taken, and that the erosion will affect the access area and the property of the riparian owners, since the adjacent owners' property will be adversely affected
                        by the dredging and filling itself because of the further erosion that will occur. In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).

                    <p>
                        Burden of Proof Before Review Commission. - Placing the burden of proof at the hearing before the review commission on the party who lost before the Department of Natural Resources and Community Development (now the Department of Environment and Natural
                        Resources) is simply a proper recognition that it is presumed that the Department will act in accordance with the law and the facts and the losing party should have the burden of showing that the Department erred. In re Broad &amp;
                        Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).

                    The Governor of this State is hereby authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of the State of North Carolina with any one or more of the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
                    Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida and with such other states as may enter into the compact, legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

                    Article I
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this Compact is to promote the better utilization of the fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, of the Atlantic seaboard by the development of a joint program for the promotion and protection of such fisheries, and by the prevention of
                    the physical waste of the fisheries from any cause. It is not the purpose of this Compact to authorize the states joining herein to limit the production of fish or fish products for the purpose of establishing or fixing the price thereof,
                    or creating and perpetuating monopoly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This agreement shall become operative immediately as to those states executing it whenever any two or more of the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina,
                    North Carolina, Georgia and Florida have executed it in the form that is in accordance with the laws of the executing state and the Congress has given its consent. Any state contiguous with any of the aforementioned states and riparian

                    Each state joining herein shall appoint three representatives to a commission hereby constituted and designated as the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. One shall be the executive officer of the administrative agency of the state charged with
                    the conservation of the fisheries resources to which this compact pertains. The second shall be a member of the legislature appointed by the Governor. The third shall be a citizen who has knowledge of and interest in marine fisheries
                    issues, appointed by the Governor. This Commission shall be a body corporate, with the powers and duties set forth herein.

                <p>
                    The duty of the said Commission shall be to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about the conservation and the prevention of the depletion and physical waste
                    of the fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, of the Atlantic seaboard. The Commission shall have power to recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several states within their respective jurisdictions
                    to promote the preservation of those fisheries and their protection against overfishing, waste, depletion or any abuse whatsoever and to assure a continuing yield from the fisheries resources of the aforementioned states. To that end
                    the Commission shall draft and, after consultation with the advisory committee hereinafter authorized, recommend to the governors and legislatures of the various signatory states legislation dealing with the conservation of the marine,
                    shell and anadromous fisheries of the Atlantic seaboard. The Commission shall more than one month prior to any regular meeting of the legislature in any signatory state, present to the governor of the state its recommendations relating
                    to enactments to be made by the legislature of that state in furthering the intents and purposes of this Compact. The Commission shall consult with and advise the pertinent administrative agencies in the states party hereto with regard
                    to problems connected with the fisheries and recommend the adoption of such regulations as it deems advisable. The Commission shall have power to recommend to the states party hereto the stocking of the waters of such states with fish
                    and fish eggs, or joint stocking by some or all of the states party hereto, and when two or more of the states shall jointly stock waters the Commission shall act as the coordinating agency for such stocking.

                    their duties, qualifications and compensation. Said Commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of its business. It may establish and maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business and may meet at
                    any time or place but must meet at least once a year.

                    To provide information to the courts and other officials taking action under G.S. 15A-1343(b1)(5), under G.S. 143-215.3(a)(7), or under any other pertinent authority of law, the Marine Fisheries Commission and the Wildlife Resources Commission are authorized
                    to adopt rules setting forth the factors that should be considered in determining the replacement costs of fish and wildlife and other marine, estuarine, and wildlife resources that have been taken, injured, removed, harmfully altered,
                    damaged, or destroyed. The Marine Fisheries Commission and the Wildlife Resources Commission may make similar rules respecting costs of investigations required by G.S. 143-215.3(a)(7) or which are made pursuant to a court order. For
                    common offenses resulting in the destruction of marine, estuarine, and wildlife resources the Marine Fisheries Commission and the Wildlife Resources Commission may adopt schedules of costs which reasonably state the likely replacement
                    costs and necessary investigative costs when appropriate. Rules of the Marine Fisheries Commission and the Wildlife Resources Commission stating scheduled costs or cost factors must be treated as prima facie evidence of the actual
                    costs, but do not prevent a court or jury from examining the reasonableness of the rules or from assessing the special factors in a case which may make the true costs either higher or lower than the amount stated in the rules. The
                    term "replacement costs" must be broadly construed to include indirect costs of replacement through habitat improvement or restoration, establishment of sanctuaries, and other recognized conservation techniques when direct stocking
                    or replacement is not feasible.

                        Fur-Dealer License. - Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any individual in this State who deals in furs must obtain an appropriate fur-dealer license. For the purposes of this subsection, "dealing in furs" is engaging in the business of
                        buying or selling fur-bearing animals or other wild animals that may lawfully be sold, the raw furs, pelts, or skins of those animals, or the furs, pelts, or skins of wild animals which may not themselves be sold but whose fur,
                        pelt, or skin may lawfully be sold. A hunter or trapper who has lawfully taken wild animals whose fur, pelt, or skin is permitted to be sold under this subsection is not considered a fur dealer if he exclusively sells the animals
                        or the furs, pelts, and skins, as appropriate, to licensed fur dealers. All fur-dealer licenses are annual licenses issued beginning July 1 each year running until the following June 30. Fur-dealer licenses issued by the Wildlife
                        Resources Commission are as follows:

                                employees of the business dealing in furs solely at the established location under the supervision of the manager need not acquire an individual license. Any employee who also deals in furs outside the established location
                                shall obtain the appropriate individual license. Individuals dealing in furs at an established location may elect to do so under their individual licenses.

                        three types: one is an area marked with appropriate signs along the outside boundaries on which only domestically raised chukars, Hungarian partridges, and game birds other than wild turkeys are taken; one is an area enclosed with
                        a dog-proof fence on which rabbits may be hunted with dogs only; and one is an area enclosed with a dog-proof fence on which foxes and coyotes may be hunted with dogs only. A controlled fox and coyote hunting preserve operated

                        license issued by the Wildlife Resources Commission for fifty dollars ($50.00). In addition to a taxidermy license, license holders engaging in taxidermy of any species of the family Cervidae must also obtain a taxidermy cervid
                        certification issued by the Wildlife Resources Commission for five dollars ($5.00), the proceeds of which shall be used to fund the Cervid Health Cooperator Program and for other chronic wasting disease surveillance. The Wildlife
                        Resources Commission is authorized by rule to set standards and reporting requirements for taxidermy licenses and certifications. No taxidermist subject to license requirements may sell any game or game fish in which he deals except
                        that a taxidermist may acquire a valid possessory lien upon game or game fish under the terms of Chapter 44A of the General Statutes and, with a trophy sale permit from the Wildlife Resources Commission, may sell the game or game
                        fish under the procedure authorized in Chapter 44A. Wildlife acquired by a taxidermist is deemed "personal property" for the purposes of Chapter 44A.

                        If the defendant does not wish to appeal, the presiding judge may order surrender of all applicable licenses and permits to an agent of the Wildlife Resources Commission. If the presiding judge does not order the surrender, or if there is for any other
                        reason a failure by the defendant to surrender all applicable licenses and permits, an authorized agent of the Wildlife Resources Commission must demand surrender. Each day's failure or refusal to surrender a license or permit
                        upon demand, in the absence of satisfactorily accounting for the failure to do so, is a separate offense. A charge under this subsection does not affect the power of the court to institute contempt proceedings if a failure or refusal
                        to surrender a license or permit also violates a court order. Any agent of the Wildlife Resources Commission accepting surrender of licenses and permits, in the courtroom or at a subsequent time and place, must transmit them to
                        the Executive Director with a written notation of the date of surrender and a report of other pertinent circumstances required by the Executive Director.

                        The Executive Director must institute a procedure for the systematic reporting to him by protectors or other authorized agents of the Wildlife Resources Commission of all convictions of suspension offenses under this section. Upon obtaining information
                        concerning conviction of a suspension offense and receiving any surrendered licenses and permits, the Executive Director must determine if all appropriate licenses and permits possessed by the defendant have been surrendered; if
                        not, the Executive Director must notify the appropriate agent of the Wildlife Resources Commission to demand surrender or renew a demand for surrender under the terms of subsection (b) if it is feasible to do so. Upon satisfying
                        himself that he has received all licenses and permits for which surrender may feasibly be obtained, if any, the Executive Director must mail the defendant a notice of the suspension of his entitlement to possess or procure any
                        license or permit of the type applicable to the activity engaged in that resulted in conviction of the suspension offense. The notice must specify the commencement and termination dates of the period of suspension that apply under

                        placed on each side of the registered property, one at each corner, and one at each point of entry. A point of entry is where a roadway, trail, path, or other way likely to be used by entering sportsmen leads into the tract. If
                        registered property is posted only with respect to fishing, it is sufficient if the notices prohibit fishing without permission, and are posted at intervals of not more than 200 yards along the stream or shoreline and at points

                    <p>
                        Purpose. - Former G.S. 113-104 and the first sentence of former G.S. 113-109(b) (similar to present G.S. 113-294(e)) had the purpose of controlling and managing the use and methods of taking wildlife.

                    <p>
                        Criminal Intent Not Required. - Because the plain terms of G.S. 113-291.1(b)(2) do not include any reference to criminal intent or mens rea, the offense of taking a bear with the aid of bait in violation of G.S. 113-291.1(b)(2) does not require proof
                        that the defendant possessed any particular mental state, including proof that he or she knew that impermissible bait had been placed at a particular location on a particular date. State v. Ballance,

                    <p>
                        No Separate Offense for Each and Every Type of Bait Listed. - G.S. 113-291.1(b)(2) does not create a separate offense for each and every type of bait listed in the relevant statutory language. Instead, a single wrong may be established by a finding of
                        various alternative elements, since the crime of taking a bear with the use or aid of bait is a single offense which may be proved by evidence of the commission of any one of a number of acts. State v. Ballance,
                        <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 720 S.E.2d 856 (2012).

                        Pursuit of Deer by Aid of Artificial Light. - One violated former G.S. 113-104 when he pursued or attempted to kill a deer by aid of or with the use of any artificial light, because this activity fell within the statutory definitions of "taking" and "game
                        animal." State v. Lassiter, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 292, 185 S.E.2d 478 (1971), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 495</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 514, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 724</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Defendant was not entitled to relief due to a trial court allegedly improperly expressing an opinion when instructing a jury on the offense of unlawfully taking deer with the assistance of artificial lighting because (1) the court's instruction to find
                        defendant guilty if the jury found defendant took a deer with the aid of an artificial light after one half hour after sunset and before one half hour before sunrise only accurately restated the prima facie evidentiary requirements
                        for the offense, and, (2) if the instruction were improper, defendant showed no prejudice, as sufficient evidence supported the jury's guilty verdict. State v. Emigh, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite>                        737, 808 S.E.2d 788 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Warrant Sufficient. - Warrants charging that defendants unlawfully and willfully attempted to take deer with the aid of an artificial light between the hours of sunset and sunrise in an area known to be inhabited and frequented by deer, were sufficient
                        to charge the offense defined by former G.S. 113-104, the words "in an area known to be inhabited and frequented by deer" were mere surplusage and could be disregarded. State v. Lassiter, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite>                        255, 175 S.E.2d 689 (1970).

                        In a prosecution charging defendants with the unlawful hunting of deer by artificial light, it was incumbent upon the defendants to ask for a bill of particulars if they desired to know in what area of the county the offense took place. State v. Lassiter,

                    <p>
                        Constitutionality. - Former G.S. 113-104, similar to G.S. 113-291, and the first sentence of former G.S. 113-109(b), similar to subsection (e) of this section, protecting and managing wildlife, were within the legitimate interests of the State and in
                        the public interest and are constitutional. State v. Lassiter, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 292, 185 S.E.2d 478 (1971), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 495</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 514,
                        appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 724</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 926 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Purpose. - Former G.S. 113-104 and the first sentence of former G.S. 113-109(b) had the purpose of controlling and managing the use and methods of taking wildlife. State v. Lassiter, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 292,
                        185 S.E.2d 478 (1971), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 495</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 514, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 724</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 926 (1972).

                    <p>
                        "Taking". - The shooting and killing of a deer with a rifle was a "taking" within the intent and meaning of former G.S. 113-294(b). State v. Link, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 568, 186 S.E.2d 634 (1972).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Section Requires Specificity. - The warrant allegedly charging defendant with the crime of taking bear with bait, in violation of this section, was invalid because it did not adequately apprise the defendant of the specific offense with which he
                        was being charged; although it charged him with aiding and abetting another individual, it did not specify the underlying offense committed by the other individual. State v. Madry, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite>                        600, 537 S.E.2d 827 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Evidence Sufficient to Support Conviction. - Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for placing processed food for use as bait in an area in which there was an open season for hunting bear in violation of G.S. 113-294(r) where defendant
                        dumped processed food at a barrel site and was with a co-defendant when she left at least one deer carcass there. State v. Ballance, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 720 S.E.2d 856 (2012).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jury Instructions. - Defendant was not entitled to relief due to a trial court allegedly improperly expressing an opinion when instructing a jury on the offense of unlawfully taking deer with the assistance of artificial lighting because (1) the court's
                        instruction to find defendant guilty if the jury found defendant took a deer with the aid of an artificial light after one half hour after sunset and before one half hour before sunrise only accurately restated the prima facie
                        evidentiary requirements for the offense, and, (2) if the instruction were improper, defendant showed no prejudice, as sufficient evidence supported the jury's guilty verdict. State v. Emigh, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite>                        737, 808 S.E.2d 788 (2017).

                        Constitutionality of Subsection (b). - The prima facie evidence rule of former G.S. 113-109(b), similar to subsection (b) of this section, was constitutional and met the requirement for constitutionality that there be a rational connection between the
                        fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed so that the inference of one from proof of the other is not unreasonable and arbitrary. State v. Lassiter, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 292, 185 S.E.2d

                        Presumption Not Conclusive. - The presumption in former G.S. 113-109(b) was not conclusive upon the jury; they could still under the law return a verdict in favor of the defendant. State v. Lassiter, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C.

                        It Does Not Deprive Defendants of Rights. - The presumption in former G.S. 113-109(b) did not shift the burden of proof from the State to the defendants, or deprive them of due process of law or the presumption of innocence, which remained with them until
                        overcome by evidence of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Lassiter, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 292, 185 S.E.2d 478 (1971), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 495</cite>,

                        court's instruction to find defendant guilty if the jury found defendant took a deer with the aid of an artificial light after one half hour after sunset and before one half hour before sunrise only accurately restated the prima
                        facie evidentiary requirements for the offense, and, (2) if the instruction were improper, defendant showed no prejudice, as sufficient evidence supported the jury's guilty verdict. State v. Emigh,

                        which is presently being used or will in the future be used to carry out the goals and objectives of the State agency utilizing such land. Each plan of wildlife management developed by the Wildlife Resources Commission shall consider
                        the question of public hunting; and whenever and wherever possible and consistent with the primary land use of the controlling agency, public hunting shall be allowed under cooperative agreement with the Wildlife Resources Commission.
                        Any dispute over the question of public hunting shall be resolved by the Division of State Property and Construction.

                    To clarify the conservation laws of the State and the authority and jurisdiction of the Department and the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission: commercial fishing waters are renamed coastal fishing waters and the Department is given jurisdiction
                    over and responsibility for the marine and estuarine resources in coastal fishing waters; the laws pertaining to commercial fishing operations and marine fishing and fisheries regulated by the Department are consolidated and revised
                    generally and broadened to reflect the jurisdictional change respecting coastal fisheries; laws relating to the conservation of wildlife resources administered by the Wildlife Resources Commission are consolidated and revised; and
                    the enforcement authority of marine fisheries inspectors and wildlife protectors is clarified, including the authority of wildlife protectors over boating and other activities other than conservation within the jurisdiction of the
                    Wildlife Resources Commission.

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Subchapter IV-A was redesignated as subchapter IVA pursuant to Session Laws 1997-456, s. 27, which authorized the Revisor of Statutes to renumber or reletter sections and parts of sections having a number or letter designation
                    that is incompatible with the General Assembly's computer program database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The words "Special Laws" in the last three lines of the first paragraph were apparently intended to read "Session Laws."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because this section relates to past events, no changes have been made in it pursuant to Session Laws 1973, c. 1262, which reorganized the former Department of Natural and Economic Resources.

                        published in the county where the suit is pending and having a bona fide circulation therein. No judgment shall be pronounced by any court condemning such commodity as contraband until after the lapse of five days from the last
                        publication of said summons. Proof of service of said summons, and the manner thereof, shall be as provided by general law.

                        Where it appears by a verified pleading on the part of the plaintiff, or by affidavit, or affidavits, or by oral testimony, that grounds for the seizure and sale exist, the clerk, in addition to the summons or warning order, shall issue a warrant of attachment,
                        which shall be signed by the clerk and bear the seal of the court. Such warrant of attachment shall specifically describe the illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product, so that the same may be identified with reasonable certainty.
                        It shall direct the sheriff to whom it is addressed to take into his custody, actual or constructive, the illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product, described therein, and to hold the same subject to the orders of the court.
                        Said warrant of attachment shall be executed as a writ of attachment is executed. No bond shall be required before the issuance of such warrant of attachment, and the sheriff shall be responsible upon his official bond for the
                        proper execution thereof.

                    <p>
                        In a proper case, the court may direct the sheriff to deliver the custody of any illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product seized by him under a warrant of attachment, to a commissioner to be appointed by the court, which commissioner shall act as the
                        agent of the court and shall give bond with such approved surety as the court may direct, conditioned that he will faithfully conserve such illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product, as may come into his custody and possession
                        in accordance with the orders of the court; provided, that the court may in its discretion appoint any member of the Department or any agent of the Department as such commissioner of the court.

                        Sales of illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product seized under the authority of this law, and notices of such sales, shall be in accordance with the laws of this State relating to the sale and disposition of attached property; provided, however, that
                        where the property is in custody of a commissioner of the court, the sale shall be held by said commissioner and not by the sheriff. For his services hereunder, such commissioner shall receive a reasonable fee to be paid out of
                        the proceeds of the sale or sales to be fixed by the court ordering such sale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The court may order that the commodity be sold in specified lots or portions, and at specified intervals, instead of being sold at one time. Title to the amount sold shall pass as of the date of the law which is found by the court to make the commodity
                        contraband. The judgment shall provide for the clear proceeds of the sales to be remitted to the Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund in accordance with G.S. 115C-457.2. The amount sold shall be treated as legal oil, legal gas or
                        legal product, as the case may be, in the hands of the purchaser, but the purchaser and the commodity shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and orders with respect to further sale or purchase or acquisition, and with
                        respect to the transportation, refining, processing, or handling in any other way, of the commodity purchased.

                        Nothing in this section shall deny or abridge any cause of action a royalty owner, or a lienholder, or any other claimant, may have, because of the forfeiture of the illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product, against the person whose act resulted in
                        such forfeiture. No illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product shall be sold for less than the average market value at the time of sale of similar products of like grade and character.

                            "minimizing intrusion upon and damage to the surface" means selecting alternative locations for wells, roads, pipelines, or production facilities, or employing alternative means of operation that prevent, reduce, or mitigate
                            the impacts of the oil and gas operations on the surface, where such alternatives are technologically sound, economically practicable, and reasonably available to the operator. The standard of conduct set forth in this subsection
                            shall not be construed to (i) prevent an operator from entering upon and using that amount of the surface as is reasonable and necessary to explore for, develop, and produce oil and gas and (ii) abrogate or impair a contractual
                            provision binding on the parties that expressly provides for the use of the surface for the conduct of oil and gas operations or that releases the operator from liability for the use of the surface. Failure of an oil or gas
                            developer or operator to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall give rise to a cause of action by the surface owner. Upon a determination by the trier of fact that such failure has occurred, a surface owner may

                            with the surface owner's use of the surface of the land. After such showing, the developer or operator shall bear the burden of proof of showing that it minimized intrusion upon and damage to the surface of the land in accordance
                            with the provisions of this subsection. If a developer or operator makes that showing, the surface owner may present rebuttal evidence. A developer or operator may assert, as an affirmative defense, that it has conducted oil
