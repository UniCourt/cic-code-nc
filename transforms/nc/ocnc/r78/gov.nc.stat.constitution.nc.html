     History Note.
    </b> - Session Laws 1969, c. 1258, proposed a complete editorial revision of the Constitution of North Carolina, to be submitted to the qualified voters of the State at the 1970 general election. The revised Constitution was adopted by
            vote of the people at the general election held Nov. 3, 1970, to take effect July 1, 1971. In addition to the new Constitution, six other constitutional amendments were submitted to the voters at the 1970 general election, to be voted on independently,
            and five of these were adopted. The effect of these amendments is indicated in notes under the sections affected.
        </p>

                            claim was not an adequate remedy at state law when it was entirely precluded by the application of the doctrine of sovereign immunity since although the student had a negligence claim under the common law, that claim was automatically

                            It is inherently arbitrary for a government entity to establish and promulgate policies and procedures and then not only utterly fail to follow them, but further to claim that an employee subject to those policies and procedures is not entitled to challenge
                            that failure; if a government entity can freely disregard its policies at its discretion, why have a test or a grievance process or any promotional policies at all? Tully v. City of Wilmington,

                        Elections. - In construing the provisions of the North Carolina Constitution in regard to elections, it should be kept in mind that this is a government of the people in which the will of the people - the majority - legally expressed, must govern, and
                        that these provisions should be liberally construed, that tend to promote a fair election, or expression of this popular will. State ex rel. Quinn v. Lattimore, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 426</cite>,

                        Acts Enacted by General Assembly. - It is axiomatic that since all political power is derived from the people and all government originates from them, the sovereign power of the people, expressed through their chosen representatives in the General Assembly,
                        is supreme, and a law enacted by them may not be set aside by the courts unless it contravenes some prohibition or mandate of the Constitution by which the people of the State have elected to be limited and restrained, or unless
                        it violates some provision of the granted powers of federal government contained in the Constitution of the United States. State v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 75</cite>, 189 S.E. 108 (1937).

        Judiciary Cannot Strip Legislative Branch of Constitutional Power to Propose Amendments to Constitution.
       </b> - Superior court erred in declaring that the members of the General Assembly duly elected in 2016 lacked authority to pass bills proposing amendments to the state constitution for the people's consideration based on
                        the fact that certain members were elected from illegally gerrymandered districts because nothing in the appellate court's jurisprudence suggested that the judiciary could unilaterally strip the legislative branch of some of its
                        constitutional powers. It was simply beyond the appellate court's power to thwart the otherwise lawful exercise of constitutional power by the legislative branch to pass bills proposing amendments; thus, the challenged constitutional

      </b> - Session Laws 2018-117, s. 2, proposed an amendment to Sec. 6 of Article I of the North Carolina Constitution, which would have added a paragraph (2): "The legislative powers of the State government shall control the powers,
                    duties, responsibilities, appointments, and terms of office of any board or commission prescribed by general law. The executive powers of the State government shall be used to faithfully execute the general laws prescribing the board
                    or commission.” The constitutional amendment was submitted to the voters at the general election held November 6, 2018, and was defeated.

                            Principle Stated. - This section embodies succinctly the judgment of the people of North Carolina in regard to the principle of the separation of powers. Long v. Watts, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 99</cite>, 110 S.E. 765,
                            22 A.L.R. 277 (1922).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The principle of separation of powers was clearly in the minds of the framers of the Constitution; and the people of North Carolina, by specifically including a separation of powers provision in the original Constitution adopted in 1776, and readopting
                            the provision in 1868 and 1970, are firmly and explicitly committed to the principle. In re Powers, 295 S.E.2d 589 (N.C. 1982).

                        <p>
                            Functions Separate. - Each of the coordinate departments has its appropriate functions, and one cannot control the action of the other in the sphere of its constitutional power and duty. State v. Holden, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 829</cite>                            (1870); Person v. Board of State Tax Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 499</cite>, 115 S.E. 336 (1922).

                        <p>
                            Classification of Departments Is Not Exact. - Although the State is firmly committed to the doctrine of separation of powers, the classification cannot be very exact, and there are many officers whose duties cannot be exclusively arranged under the duties
                            of either of the judicial, legislative or executive heads. Jernigan v. State, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 556</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 259 (1971).

                            was not enough to establish the requisite intent for a conversion charge was rejected because the North Carolina legislature specifically included that limitation in the obtaining property by false pretenses statute, but not
                            in the conversion statute; <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIa24s14-168.1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-168.1</a></cite> could not be rewritten as under N.C. Const., Art. I,

                        <p>
                            Appointment of Executive Officers. - Senatorial confirmation of the members of the Governor's Cabinet does not violate the separation of powers clause when the Governor retains the power to nominate them, has strong supervisory authority over them, and
                            has the power to remove them at will. The Governor's power to nominate is significant, and the ultimate appointee will be a person that he alone has chosen, subject only to an up-or-down vote by the Senate. The Governor's supervisory
                            and removal powers, moreover, ensure that the Governor retains ample post-appointment control over how his Cabinet members perform their duties. As a result, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143B.html#t143Ba01s143B-9ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 143B-9(a)</a></cite>'s
                            senatorial confirmation requirement leaves the Governor with enough control to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and therefore does not violate the Separation of Powers Clause. Cooper v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 799</cite>,
                            822 S.E.2d 286 (2018).

                            The independence of the Supreme Court only, and not of the entire judicial department, is provided for by this section. But there is nothing which gives the Supreme Court supervisory control over the legislature. Walser ex rel. Wilson v. Jordan,
                            <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 683</cite>, 33 S.E. 139 (1899).

                            Court Practice Regulated by Judiciary. - Under the Constitution, as the supreme judicial power is independent of the other departments, the legislature cannot prescribe rules of practice for the Supreme Court; nevertheless, the courts have copied, almost
                            verbatim, the provisions of the Code. Herndon v. Imperial Fire Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 384</cite>, 16 S.E. 465 (1892); Bird v. Gilliam, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 76</cite>,

                            The Supreme Court has the sole right to prescribe rules of practice and procedure therein. Lee v. Baird, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 361</cite>, 59 S.E. 876 (1907); State v. Furmage, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 616</cite>,

                            given to the Supreme Court by this section, a statute in conflict therewith will not be observed. State v. Ward, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 618</cite>, 113 S.E. 775 (1922).

                            is grounded on the separation of powers provisions found in many American Constitutions, including the Constitution of this State. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d

         Judiciary Cannot Strip Legislative Branch of Constitutional Power to Propose Amendments to Constitution.
        </b> - Superior court erred in declaring that the members of the General Assembly duly elected in 2016 lacked authority to pass bills proposing amendments to the state constitution for the people's consideration based
                            on the fact that certain members were elected from illegally gerrymandered districts because nothing in the appellate court's jurisprudence suggested that the judiciary could unilaterally strip the legislative branch of some
                            of its constitutional powers. It was simply beyond the appellate court's power to thwart the otherwise lawful exercise of constitutional power by the legislative branch to pass bills proposing amendments; thus, the challenged
                            constitutional amendments duly ratified by the people were valid. N.C. State Conf. of the NAACP v. Moore, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Sept. 15, 2020).

                            Judiciary Could Not Order Judgment Be Paid from State Treasury. - Although the State of North Carolina violated a provision in the North Carolina Constitution when it moved money otherwise destined for county schools to a separate state fund to pay for
                            county jail programs, a trial court could not command state officials to pay money from the State of North Carolina's treasury to satisfy the court judgment against the State, because the Separation of Powers Clause in the
                            Constitution prevented the courts from stepping into the shoes of the other branches of government and assuming their constitutional duties. Richmond Cty. Bd. of Educ. v.

                            The legislature may constitutionally provide for a "de novo" review of the quasi-judicial decision of an agency; therefore, review of a civil service board's decision by the superior court under the "de novo" standard did not violate this section nor
                            impermissibly allow the judicial branch to substitute its judgment for that of the city manager on a personnel matter where the question before the superior court was not whether the employee should have been terminated rather
                            than demoted, suspended, or transferred, but whether the action of the employee's supervisor was "justified." Jacobs v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 528 S.E.2d

                            Amendment of Judicially Imposed Criminal Sentences by Corrections Department. - The legislative, executive, and supreme judicial powers of the State government are separate and distinct from each other; therefore, by independently amending sentences imposed
                            by trial courts to reflect compliance with its interpretation of statutory authority, the Corrections Department usurped the power of the judiciary and violated the separation of powers doctrine. Hamilton v. Freeman,

                            Even though superior court's order of consecutive sentencing was contrary to law, the Department of Corrections could not alter that order by refusing to change defendant's records to reflect concurrent sentencing without violating the separation of powers

                            (2) there was no double jeopardy infirmity inherent in the Habitual Felon Act as applied in conjunction with the North Carolina Structured Sentencing Act; and (3) the state appellate court and the state supreme court have rejected

                            Legislature May Establish Parole System. - In the division of governmental authority, the legislature has exclusive power to determine the penological system of the State. It alone can prescribe the punishment for crime. It may therefore establish a parole
                            system. Jernigan v. State, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 556</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 259 (1971).

                            Removal of Officeholder. - It is competent for the legislature in creating an office, other than purely judicial, to reserve to itself the right to remove, or to the Governor to suspend, the incumbent of the office. State ex rel. Caldwell v. Wilson,

                            Appointment of Executive Officers. - When executive officers appointed by the General Assembly form a majority on a commission that has the final say on how to execute the laws the General Assembly, not the Governor, can exert most of the control over
                            the executive policy that is implemented; the Governor cannot take care that the laws are faithfully executed, and the separation of powers clause does not allow the General Assembly to take this much control over the execution
                            of the laws from the Governor and lodge it with itself. State ex rel. McCrory v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 633</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 248 (2016).

                            the Governor from performing his express constitutional duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. State ex rel. McCrory v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 633</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 248 (2016).

                            Supreme Court of North Carolina concludes that the relevant provisions of N.C. Sess. Laws 2017-6, when considered as a unified whole, leave the Governor with little control over the views and priorities of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics
                            Enforcement by requiring that a sufficient number of its members to block the implementation of the Governor's policy preferences be selected from a list of nominees chosen by the leader of the political party other than the
                            one to which the Governor belongs, limiting the extent to which individuals supportive of the Governor's policy preferences have the ability to supervise the activities of the Bipartisan State Board, and significantly constraining
                            the Governor's ability to remove members of the Bipartisan State Board. Cooper v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 392</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 98 (2018).

                            Manner in which the membership of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement is structured and operates under N.C. Sess. Laws 2017-6 impermissibly, facially, and beyond a reasonable doubt interferes with the Governor's ability to ensure

                            Delegation to Municipalities. - Ordinary restrictions with respect to the delegation of power to an agency of the State, which exercises no function of government, do not apply to cities, towns or counties. Plemmer v. Matthewson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 722</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 204 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Delegation to Administrative Bodies. - As to some specific subject matter, the legislature may delegate a limited portion of its legislative power to an administrative agency if it prescribes the standards under which the agency is to exercise the delegated
                            powers. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 551 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A modern legislature must be able to delegate, in proper instances, a limited portion of its legislative powers to administrative bodies which are equipped to adapt legislation to complex conditions involving numerous details with which the legislature
                            cannot deal directly. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The principle that the General Assembly may not delegate its power to any other department or body, is not absolute. Since legislation must often be adapted to complex conditions involving numerous details with which the legislature cannot deal directly,
                            the constitutional prohibition against delegating legislative authority does not deny to the legislature the necessary flexibility of enabling it to lay down policies and establish standards, while leaving to designated governmental
                            agencies and administrative boards the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the legislature shall apply. A-S-P Assocs. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 207</cite>,

                        <p>
                            By providing adequate guidelines for rules review, the General Assembly has ensured that the North Carolina Rules Review Commission's authority as it relates to the rules promulgated by the North Carolina State Board of Education is not "arbitrary and
                            unreasoned" and is sufficiently defined to maintain the separation of powers required by the State Constitution. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 514,
                            805 S.E.2d 518 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2018).

                        <p>
                            Review and approval authority delegated to the North Carolina Rules Review Commission is an appropriate delegable power, and the General Assembly has adequately directed the Commission's review of the North Carolina State Board of Education proposed rules
                            and limited the role of the Commission to evaluating those proposed rules to ensure compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite>                            514, 805 S.E.2d 518 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2018).

                        <p>
                            Necessity for Adequate Standards When Delegating Power. - As to some specific subject matter, the legislature may delegate a limited portion of its legislative power to an administrative agency if it prescribes the standards under which the agency is
                            to exercise the delegated powers. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The constitutional inhibition against delegating legislative authority does not preclude the legislature from transferring adjudicative and rule-making powers to administrative bodies, provided such transfers are accompanied by adequate guiding standards
                            to govern the exercise of the delegated powers. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When there is an obvious need for expertise in the achievement of legislative goals, the General Assembly is not required to lay down a detailed agenda covering every conceivable problem which might arise in the implementation of the legislation. It is
                            enough if general policies and standards have been articulated which are sufficient to provide direction to an administrative body possessing the expertise to adapt the legislative goals to varying circumstances. Adams v. North
                            Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The test of constitutional delegation of legislative power is whether the delegation is accompanied by adequate guiding standards; if so, the delegation will be upheld. In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>,
                            266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The General Assembly must prescribe the standard for an administrative board with sufficient definiteness so that the board is bound by legislative policy and cannot, under the name of finding facts, actually set policy. Farlow v. North Carolina State
                            Bd. of Chiropractic Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 332 S.E.2d 696, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 664</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 621 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Purpose of Adequate Guiding Standards Test. - The purpose of the adequate guiding standards test is to reconcile the legislative need to delegate authority with the constitutional mandate that the legislature retain in its own hands the supreme legislative
                            power. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978). See also, In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n,
                            <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Application of Test. - The key to an intelligent application of the adequate guiding standards test is an understanding that, while delegations of power to administrative agencies are necessary, such transfers of power should be closely monitored to insure
                            that the decision making by the agency is not arbitrary and unreasoned and that the agency is not asked to make important policy choices which might just as easily be made by the elected representatives in the legislature.

                        <p>
                            Specificity of Legislative Goals. - Goals and policies set forth by legislature for an agency to apply in exercising its powers need be only as specific as the circumstances permit. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources,
                            <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978); In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Procedural Safeguards. - In determining whether a particular delegation of authority is supported by adequate guiding standards, it is permissible to consider whether the authority vested in the agency is subject to procedural safeguards. A key purpose
                            of the adequate guiding standards test is to insure that the decision making by the agency is not arbitrary and unreasoned. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources,
                            <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978). See also In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Procedural safeguards tend to encourage adherence to legislative standards by the agency to which power has been delegated. The presence or absence of procedural safeguards is relevant to the broader question of whether a delegation of authority is accompanied
                            by adequate guiding standards. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                            Delegation of Power Upheld. - Creation of the Mattamuskeet Drainage District by the legislature is not violative of the Constitution. O'Neal v. Mann, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 153</cite>, 136 S.E. 379 (1927).

                        City Parade Ordinance Held Constitutional. - Where a city's parade ordinance was codified under the general heading of traffic, its language was directed to the time, place and manner of parades, and it neither imposed restraint upon speech concerning

                        Ballot Access Rules Held Constitutional. - While North Carolina's ballot access scheme inevitably burdened the associational rights of members of small parties as well as the informational interests of all voters regardless of their party affiliation,
                        it also found that associational rights were not absolute and were necessarily subject to qualification if elections were to be run fairly and effectively. Because a legislative enactment had to be upheld unless its unconstitutionality
                        clearly and unmistakably appeared beyond a reasonable doubt or it could not be upheld on any reasonable ground, the appellate court held that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a09s163-96ol1a2" target="_blank">G.S. 163-96(a)(2)</a></cite>                        was not violative of N.C.

        Right to Instruct Clause.
       </b> - North Carolina Court of Appeals rejects the claim that the N.C. Constitution permits courts to dictate how much time the General Assembly must spend contemplating legislative action; the framers left to the judgment
                        of the legislative branch how quickly to move a bill through the law-making process. The Right to Instruct Clause, does not change that and simply requires that the process, however quickly it moves, must be open to the public
                        and people must have ways to contact their representatives to convey their views during that process. Common Cause v. Forest, - N.C. App. - , 838 S.E.2d 668 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Words in the Right to Instruct Clause reflect a right of the people to teach or advise their representatives, not to bind them; the Right to Instruct protects the ability of the people to contact their elected representatives and convey their views about
                        the decisions those representatives are tasked with making on their behalf. Common Cause v. Forest, - N.C. App. - , 838 S.E.2d 668 (2020).

                        Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Ecclesiastical Matter. - Trial court erred in denying parish council members' motion to dismiss church members' action because the claims could not be adjudicated in the judicial system since the church members
                        raised questions that went far beyond the consideration of "neutral principles of law" and would require the court to interpret or weigh church doctrine; the allegations were focused upon the actual governance of the church and

                        is unconstitutional as violative of the prohibition against the establishment of religion as found in both this section and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it distinguishes between homes that are religiously

                        <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 19 and U.S. Const., Amend. I may be said to coalesce into a singular guarantee of freedom of religious profession and worship, as well as an equally firmly established separation of church and state. The legislature
                        oversteps the bounds of this separation when it enacts a regulatory scheme which, whether in purpose, substantive effect, or administrative procedure, tends to "control or interfere" with religious affairs, or to "discriminate"
                        along religious lines, or to constitute a law "respecting" the establishment of religion. Stated simply, the constitutional mandate is one of secular neutrality toward religion. Heritage Village Church &amp; Missionary Fellowship,
                        Inc. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 399</cite>, 263 S.E.2d 726 (1980).

                        This Section Protects Freedom to Exercise One's Religion. - The term "rights of conscience," as used in this section, must be construed in relation to the right to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience. Consequently, the freedom
                        protected by this provision is no more extensive than the freedom to exercise one's religion, which is protected by U.S. Const., Amend. I. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d
                        317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                    <p>
                        It Does Not Protect One's Sense of Ethics. - This constitutional provision does not provide immunity for every act which one's conscience permits him to do, or even for every act which one's conscience classifies as required by ethics, nor shield the
                        defendant from a command by the State that he do an act merely because he believes it morally or ethically wrong. It is the right to exercise one's religion, or lack of it, which is protected, not one's sense of ethics. In re Williams,

                    <p>
                        Protection Not Limited to Clergymen and Organized Religious Groups. - The freedoms protected by this constitutional provision are not limited to clergymen. Indeed, they are not limited to members of an organized religious body, and consequently are not
                        contingent upon proof that others share the views of the individual who asserts his own constitutional right to the freedom to exercise his religion or "right of conscience." In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>,
                        152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                    <p>
                        Unorthodox Religious Beliefs Are Protected. - This constitutional provision extends its protection to the unorthodox, unusual and unreasonable belief as truly as to the belief shared by many. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>,
                        152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                    <p>
                        But freedom to exercise one's religious beliefs is not absolute. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                        Use of drugs may be prohibited notwithstanding the user's asserted belief that such use is required by Divine Law. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct.

                    <p>
                        Religious Freedom Is Impaired by Governmental Compulsion of That Which Religious Belief Forbids. - The free exercise of religion is impaired not only by the governmental prohibition of that which one's religious belief demands, but also by governmental
                        compulsion of that which one's religious belief forbids. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                        Government May Not Force One to Act Contrary to Religious Belief in Absence of "Compelling State Interest". - The liberty secured by U.S. Const., Amend. I and by this section is so basic and fundamental that one may not be compelled by governmental action
                        to do that which is contrary to his religious belief in the absence of a "compelling State interest in the regulation of a subject within the State's constitutional power to regulate." In re Williams,
                        <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                    <p>
                        Effective operation of courts of justice is a "compelling State interest." In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                    <p>
                        Overrides Belief of Witness Who Refuses to Testify for Religious Reasons. - The "compelling interest" of the State in the rendering of a just judgment in accordance with its law overrides the incidental infringement upon the religious belief of a witness
                        that for him to testify is wrong. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
                    </p>

                        The State has a compelling interest that a person called as a witness should be sworn and should testify in the administration of justice between the State and one charged with a serious offense, and therefore a minister called as a witness in such prosecution
                        may be held in contempt of court upon his refusal to be sworn as a witness, notwithstanding his assertion that his refusal is a matter of religious conscience. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>,
                        152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                        The legal tribunals of the State have no jurisdiction over purely ecclesiastical questions and controversies, for there is a constitutional guarantee of freedom of religious profession and worship, as well as an equally firmly established separation of
                        church and State, but the courts do have jurisdiction as to civil, contract and property rights which are involved in, or arise from, a church controversy. Reid v. Johnston, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 201</cite>,

                        Civil Court's Jurisdiction Over Church's Termination of Members. - While a court did not have jurisdiction to consider ecclesiastical matters in a church's governance of its membership, such as whether the grounds in a termination letter to two church
                        members were accurate and whether the termination was conducted in a fair and reasonable manner and in good faith, the two terminated members had a property interest in their membership, and the court could consider whether the
                        church's bylaws were properly adopted and followed by the church in the termination of the members. Tubiolo v. Abundant Life Church, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 324, 605 S.E.2d 161 (2004),

                        How Civil Courts Must Decide Church Property Disputes. - Civil courts must decide church property disputes without inquiring into underlying controversies over religious doctrines and without in any way basing their decisions upon any determination made
                        upon such an inquiry. Atkins v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 198 S.E.2d 101, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 306</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 641 (1973).

                    <p>
                        Appellate court erred in dismissing the pastor's appeal of the trial court's denial of the pastor's motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought against the pastor, secretary, and board chairman over whether they were diverting church funds because no neutral
                        principles of law existed to resolve the church members' claims that the pastor, secretary, and board chairman were making improper use of the funds, the courts had to defer to the church's internal governing body, the Council
                        for Ministry, to avoid becoming impermissibly entangled in the dispute, in violation of the First Amendment and the North Carolina Constitution. Harris v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 265</cite>,

                        In a child custody proceeding, the court cannot base its findings on the preferability of any particular faith or religious instruction. Dean v. Dean, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 232 S.E.2d 470 (1977).

                        Spiritual welfare of a child is a factor that may be considered by the trial court in making a custody determination. Dean v. Dean, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 232 S.E.2d 470 (1977).

                        Biological Parents' Rights Outweighed Adoptive Parents' Rights. - Biological parents constitutionally-protected paramount right to custody, care, and control of their child, including control over his associations, outweighed adoptive parents' interests,
                        including their right to freedom of religion; therefore, inquiry into plaintiffs' religious beliefs, if error, was harmless. Petersen v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 397</cite>, 445 S.E.2d 901 (1994).

                        A law requiring the observance of Sunday as a day of rest and relaxation does not cease to be a reasonable exercise of the police power of the State, merely because it is in harmony with the religious beliefs of most Christian denominations. Raleigh Mobile
                        Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).

                    <p>
                        The choice of Sunday by the legislature as a day of rest and relaxation does not render statute unconstitutional, as a law establishing a religion or interfering with freedom of worship, merely because other persons are required by their religious convictions
                        to rest from their labors on a different day of the week, or because, having no religious convictions, they consider Sunday as an exceptionally promising day for business. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).

                    <p>
                        The provisions of this section do not deprive the legislature of authority to prohibit by a statute, otherwise valid, the carrying on of and engaging in, on Sunday, any and all labor and the operation of industrial and commercial pursuits, except for
                        works of necessity and acts which, themselves, are in exercise of the constitutional right to worship. Moreover, the legislature may delegate this power to municipalities. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).

                        A municipal ordinance prohibiting the handling of venomous and poisonous reptiles in such a manner as to endanger the public health, safety and welfare would not be held invalid upon defendants' contention that the ordinance interfered with the exercise

                            repeated references to victim as a "nigger" presented a classic case of the use of "fighting words" tending to incite an immediate breach of the peace which are not protected by either the Constitution of the United States

                            Deputy sheriff's free speech rights were not violated because mutual confidence and loyalty between a sheriff and a deputy were crucial in accomplishing the sheriff's policies and duties; thus, the deputy could be lawfully terminated for political reasons
                            under the exception to prohibited political terminations; by standing in the elected sheriff's shoes, a deputy sheriff fills a role in which loyalty to the elected sheriff is necessary to ensure that the sheriff's policies
                            are carried out. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).

                            Balancing of Freedom of Speech and Press and Right to Fair Trial. - The framers of the federal and State Constitutions gave no priorities to the fundamental guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press and the guarantee that every criminal defendant
                            shall receive a fair trial, but left to the courts the delicate task of balancing the defendant's constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair trial against the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the
                            press. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 437 (1981).

                            Burden of Justifying "Gag" Rule. - Even pervasive, adverse publicity does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial, and any prior restraint on expression comes to the courts with a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity; thus, one seeking
                            to impose a "gag" rule carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a rule. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 437 (1981).

                            to a commercial social networking Web site is prohibited to a registered sex offender, and these factors ensure that registered sex offenders are prohibited from accessing only those Web sites where they could actually gather

                            carefully delineated Web sites where vulnerable youthful users may congregate; whatever overbreadth may exist should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not

                            Court of appeals erred in vacating defendant's conviction for accessing a social networking Web site as a registered sex offender on the ground that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa26s14-202.5" target="_blank">G.S. 14-202.5</a></cite>                            was unconstitutional because the statute was constitutional in all respects.

                            the ability of registered sex offenders to access certain carefully-defined Web sites; this limitation on conduct only incidentally burdens the ability of registered sex offenders to engage in speech after accessing those Web

                            networking Web sites without regard to any content or message conveyed on those sites; the limitations are based not upon speech contained in or posted on a site but focus on whether functions of a particular Web site are available
                            for use by minors, and the statute involves a facially content-neutral ban on the use of commercial social networking Web sites. State v. Packingham, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 380</cite>, 777 S.E.2d 738 (2015).

                            power of the General Assembly, and protecting children from sexual abuse is a substantial governmental interest; the interest reflected in the statute, which protects children from convicted sex offenders who could harvest

                            only Web sites that allow them the opportunity to gather information about minors, thereby addressing the evil that the statute seeks to prevent, and the statute allows alternatives through specific exceptions for Web sites
                            that provide discrete e-mail, chat room, photo-sharing, and instant messaging services; thus, the statute is sufficiently narrowly drawn. State v. Packingham, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 380</cite>, 777 S.E.2d 738 (2015).

                            City Parade Ordinance Constitutional. - Where a city's parade ordinance was codified under the general heading of traffic, its language was directed to the time, place and manner of parades, and it neither imposed restraint upon speech concerning political
                            matters or matters of public concern nor contained any inkling of discrimination against defendant, who was arrested for participating in a parade without a permit, the ordinance was constitutionally valid. State v. Frinks,

                            Newspaper companies were entitled to summary judgment on their action challenging an airport operator's ban on newspaper racks because the ban on the installation of news racks within the terminals substantially burdened the newspaper companies' expressive

                            Employee's Right to Free Speech. - The test of whether speech that allegedly leads to the discharge of an employee involves a matter of public concern is whether the employee was speaking as a citizen about matters of public concern, or as an employee

                            free speech abridgment claims against private sector employers under the North Carolina constitution, which did not recognize a remedy for private sector employees against their employers. Hardin v. Belmont Textile Mach., Co.,

         No Right to Recover Against Employer in Individual Capacity.
        </b> - A public employee who suffers retaliation for his protected speech has a cause of action against his employer directly under this section, and even though sovereign immunity does not bar such a suit, the state
                            constitution does not create a right to recovery against a public employer in his individual capacity. Myers v. Town of Landis, 957 F. Supp. 762 (M.D.N.C. 1996).

                            Establishing Claim of Retaliatory Discharge. - To properly advance a claim that an employee was discharged in retaliation for exercising her free speech rights under the State Constitution, the speech at issue first must involve a matter of public concern,
                            and, second, such protected speech or activity must have been the motivating or "but for" cause for the employee's discharge. Evans v. Cowan, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 510 S.E.2d

                            Discharge of County Sheriff's Deputy and Employee. - Deputy sheriff was discharged based upon political conduct without violating free speech rights. Dismissal of another employee's claim for violation of the employee's rights to free speech was appropriate
                            because the sheriff produced evidence that the employee was discharged for failure to comply with the sheriff's department rules and policies, and the employee failed to produce specific evidence that the employee's discharge
                            was politically motivated. McLaughlin v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 771 S.E.2d 570 (2015), dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 284</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 835, 2015

                            Waiver of Right to Freedom of Speech. - Parents offered no evidence to show that their First Amendment right to freedom of speech was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived. The parents and their attorney agreed to and executed the mediated
                            settlement agreement, and specifically agreed to the paragraphs which limited their speech regarding the deputy. Estate of Barber v. Guilford County Sheriff's Dep't, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite>                            658, 589 S.E.2d 433 (2003).

                            Ballot Access Rules Held Constitutional. - While North Carolina's ballot access scheme inevitably burdened the associational rights of members of small parties as well as the informational interests of all voters regardless of their party affiliation,
                            it also found that associational rights were not absolute and were necessarily subject to qualification if elections were to be run fairly and effectively. Because a legislative enactment had to be upheld unless its unconstitutionality
                            clearly and unmistakably appeared beyond a reasonable doubt or it could not be upheld on any reasonable ground, the appellate court held that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a09s163-96ol1a2" target="_blank">G.S. 163-96(a)(2)</a></cite>                            was not violative of N.C.

                        of financing public schools in this State resulted in inequities in educational programs and facilities between the public schools within that county, which had a relatively low tax base from which to draw funds, and those in other
                        counties with relatively high tax bases, and that the operation of five separate school systems in that county prohibited effective use of facilities and staff and promoted inequitable use of State and local funds, thus depriving
                        them of equal opportunity to a free public school education in violation of this section, N.C. Const., Art. I,

                        the students or parents themselves might apply for a partial or complete exemption from the fee requirements, since the waiver policy did not fairly guarantee to low income and indigent students their right of equal access to the

                        For purposes of our Constitution, a sound basic education will provide the student with at least: (1) sufficient ability to read, write, and speak English and a sufficient knowledge of fundamental math and physical science to enable the student to function
                        in a complex and rapidly changing society; (2) sufficient fundamental knowledge of geography, history and basic economic and political systems to enable the student to make informed choices regarding personal issues or issues that
                        affect the community, state, and nation; (3) sufficient academic and vocational skills to enable the student to successfully engage in post-secondary education or vocational training; (4) and sufficient academic and social skills

                        When a parent alleged the parent's autistic children were denied rights to a sound basic education due to a school board's (board) failure to remedy the children's harassment by other students, the board's motion to dismiss should have been granted because,
                        while the board could not assert governmental immunity as a defense to an alleged constitutional violation, the constitutional right to a sound basic education had not been interpreted to extend beyond the intellectual function
                        of academics. Deminski v. State Bd. of Educ., - N.C. App. - , 837 S.E.2d 611 (2020).

                        Alternative Education. - Considering longstanding precedent affording school officials discretion in administering student disciplinary codes and the state constitutional right to a sound basic education, school officials were required to articulate a

                        An ex post facto law is one which either makes that a crime which was not a crime when the offense was committed or which imposes a heavier sentence than that which was prescribed by law at that time. State v. Broadway, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 598</cite>,

                        Retroactive application of the Robbins decision to the inmate's parole eligibility did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws because the Fair Sentencing Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIIa81As15A-1340.1" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1340.1</a></cite>                        to 15A-1340.7 had undergone no substantive change subsequent to the commission of the inmate's crimes.

                        Judicial Abrogation of Common-Law Criminal Principles. - Whereas this decision holds that the year and a day rule as formerly utilized in murder prosecutions is no longer part of the common law of the state, to apply this decision abrogating the year
                        and a day rule to permit defendant to be convicted of murder in the present case would, at the very least, permit his conviction upon less evidence than would have been required to convict him of that crime at the time the victim
                        died and would, for that reason, violate the principles preventing the application of ex post facto laws. The judgment against defendant for second degree murder was vacated where defendant did not die within a year and a day of
                        the acts in question; however, under the circumstances of this case, a conviction for involuntary manslaughter was appropriate. State v. Vance, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 613</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 495 (1991).

                        Where the punishment at the time of the offense was death or life imprisonment in the discretion of the jury, a change by the legislature to death alone would be ex post facto as to offenses committed prior to the change. State v. Waddell,
                        <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 431</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 19 (1973).

                        Any legislation which increases the punishment for a crime between the time the offense was committed and the time a defendant is punished therefor is considered an invalid ex post facto law as applied to that defendant. State v. Wright,

                        Nor May An Increase by Judicial Action. - While the letter of the ex post facto clause is addressed to legislative action, the constitutional ban against the retroactive increase of punishment for a crime applies as well against judicial action having
                        the same effect. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 431</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 19 (1973).

                        403 S.E.2d 495 (1991) violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws where the murderous acts occurred prior to the abrogation and the victim's death occurred after the abrogation but more than a year and a day after the murderous

                        Generally, the legislature may validate retrospectively any proceeding which might have been authorized in advance, even though its act may operate to divest a right of action existing in favor of an individual or subject him to a loss he would otherwise
                        not have incurred. This general rule is subject, however, to some exceptions. Anderson v. Wilkins, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 154</cite>, 55 S.E. 272 (1906).

                        which required respondent to bear the burden of proof to show that he was no longer dangerous or mentally ill and opened the hearing to the public, were procedural changes that did not violate substantive rights or protections

                        was convicted of a felony in 1983 and had fully served his sentence on that conviction when he was found in possession of a handgun in 2001, did not violate ex post facto where the statute was amended in 1995 and applied to all
                        occurrences after that date; ex post facto was also not violated since defendant's 1983 conviction, which was the predicate felony for his conviction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sXIa54As14-415.1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-415.1</a></cite>,
                        was a felony in 1983, was a felony in 1995 when the statute was amended, and was a felony in 2001 when defendant was found in possession of a handgun; finally, the amendment to G.S. 14-415.1 in 1995 did not increase the punishment
                        for defendant's prior 1983 felony, but created a new offense, so ex post facto was also not violated on that ground. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 610 S.E.2d 739 (2005).

                            Notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to depriving a person of his property are essential elements of due process of law which are guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV and this section. State v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                            742, 370 S.E.2d 260 (1988).

                            Presumption That Proceedings Be Open. - The framers' use of the imperative word "shall" places constitutional limits on a court's discretion in exercising control of its proceedings and creates a strong presumption that court proceedings be open to the
                            litigants and the public; however, there are some circumstances when a court may close proceedings and seal court records. Virmani v. Presbyterian Health Servs. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite>                            629, 493 S.E.2d 310 (1997), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 449</cite>, 515 S.E.2d 675 (1999).

                        <p>
                            Punitive Damages Cap. - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001D.html#t1Ds1D-25" target="_blank">G.S. 1D-25</a></cite>, which places a cap on punitive damages, is not unconstitutional under the open courts provision,
                            because it does not limit the recovery of actual damages. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 562 S.E.2d 82 (2002), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

                        <p>
                            Because the Open Courts Clause of N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 18 does not prevent the General Assembly from abolishing the recovery of punitive damages altogether, it follows that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001D.html#t1Ds1D-25" target="_blank">G.S. 1D-25</a></cite>,
                            which limits the awards of punitive damages, does not violate the Open Courts Clause. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

                        <p>
                            Waiver of Rights. - While every reasonable presumption will be indulged against a waiver of fundamental constitutional rights by a defendant in a criminal prosecution, a defendant may waive the benefit of constitutional guarantees by express consent,
                            by failure to assert them in apt time, or by conduct inconsistent with a purpose to insist upon them. State v. Hutchins, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 321</cite>, 279 S.E.2d 788 (1981).

                        <p>
                            Right to Present a Defense. - Trial court erred by excluding the testimony of three character witnesses pertaining to the victim's past specific instances of violent conduct because the testimony was permitted under this section as defendant claimed he
                            acted in self-defense, and the exclusion of the evidence denied defendant his constitutional right to present a complete defense. State v. Bass, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 802
                            S.E.2d 477 (2017), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 535</cite>, 819 S.E.2d 322 (2018).

                            There is no constitutional impediment to arbitration agreements. Miller v. Two State Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 455 S.E.2d 678 (1995).

                        <p>
                            Waiver by Arbitration. - An agreement to arbitrate a dispute is not an unenforceable contract requiring waiver of a jury; thus, the trial court erred in concluding that because arbitration provision did not provide for trial of facts by a jury that it
                            was unconscionable and unenforceable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.022B.html#t22Ba02s22B-10" target="_blank">G.S. 22B-10</a></cite>, and in violation of N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §§

                            Indictment, Arraignment and Trial on Same Day. - Defendant's indictment, arraignment, and trial on the same day on a burglary charge was not such a flagrant violation of his due process rights that the court was required to dismiss the burglary indictment,
                            since defendant, by not contesting indictments for armed robbery, larceny, and rape, conceded that he had been given sufficient time in which to prepare a defense on such charges; the burglary indictment arose out of the same
                            series of events which led to the three other indictments; the offenses took place at such close proximity in time that any defense which counsel might have prepared to the charge of burglary could not have significantly differed
                            from the defenses he prepared to the charges of larceny, armed robbery, and rape; and any proof of the nonexistence of the essential elements of burglary would necessarily be included in defendant's defense on the other charges
                            in this case, because for each charge defendant would seek to disprove the State's evidence of the sequence of events leading up to the charge, which facts also supported the burglary indictment. State v. Revelle,
                            <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 153</cite>, 270 S.E.2d 476 (1980).

                        <p>
                            Foreclosure of Mortgages. - This section is not violated by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.045.html#t45a2Bs45-21.34" target="_blank">G.S. 45-21.34</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.045.html#t45a2Bs45-21.35" target="_blank">G.S. 45-21.35</a></cite>,
                            regulating the sale of real property upon the foreclosure of mortgages or deeds of trust. Woltz v. Asheville Safe Deposit Co., <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 239</cite>, 173 S.E. 587 (1934).

                            the creditor to enforce payment by action in accordance with the terms of the agreement, but provides merely for judicial supervision of sales under power to the end that the price bid at the sale shall not be conclusive as
                            to the value of the property, and that the creditor may not recover any deficiency after applying the purchase price to the notes without first accounting for the fair value of the property in accordance with well-settled principles
                            of equity. Richmond Mtg. &amp; Loan Corp. v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 29</cite>, 185 S.E. 482 (1936), aff'd, 300 U.S. 124, 57 S. Ct. 338, 81 L. Ed. 552 (1937).

                            Not Applicable to Undergraduate Court. - Undergraduate Court's powers are not derivative of the North Carolina judiciary system nor are they limited by the safeguards protecting a citizen in the state court system; thus, the undergraduate court could
                            not be categorized as a "court" and the proceedings are not required to be open to the public. DTH Publishing Corp. v. University of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 534, 496 S.E.2d

                            Use of Closed Circuit Television Held Adequate to Allow Defendant to Confront Child Victim. - Where, in prosecution for taking indecent liberties with a four-year-old child, during voir dire hearing as to victim's competency as a witness, defendant, although
                            absent from the courtroom, was able to hear all testimony, interact freely with his attorney, and through his attorney confront the victim, thereby accomplishing effective cross-examination, the exclusion of defendant did not
                            violate N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 18, 19 or 23, as the trial court's use of a closed circuit television and its act of providing defendant and his attorney adequate opportunity to communicate during the victim's testimony were sufficient to permit
                            defendant to hear the evidence and to refute it. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 584, 367 S.E.2d 139 (1988).

    §§
   </span> 18, 19, 23, 24, and 27 were not violated by the trial court's failure to intervene ex mero motu in the prosecutor's closing argument, as while comparisons between criminal defendants and animals were strongly disfavored,
                            the state's use of an analogy to animals in packs helped explain the complex legal theory surrounding premeditation and deliberation. State v. Oakes, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 703 S.E.2d 476, review denied

                            Prosecutor's Conflict of Interest. - A prosecutor may not be disqualified from prosecuting a criminal action in this State unless and until the trial court determines that an actual conflict of interests exists. In this context, an "actual conflict of
                            interests" is demonstrated where a district attorney or a member of his or her staff has previously represented the defendant with regard to the charges to be prosecuted and, as a result of that former attorney-client relationship,
                            the prosecution has obtained confidential information which may be used to the defendant's detriment at trial. Any order of disqualification ordinarily should be directed only to individual prosecutors who have been exposed
                            to such information. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).

                            District Attorney's Abuse of Calendaring Authority Unconstitutional. - Where the district attorney placed a large number of cases on the printed trial calendar knowing that all of the cases would not be called, thereby providing defendants virtually no
                            notice of which cases were actually going to be called for trial, a tactic often employed by the district attorney in an attempt to surprise criminal defense counsel, the allegations were sufficient to state a claim that the
                            statutes which grant the district attorney calendaring authority were being applied in an unconstitutional manner in the Fourteenth Prosecutorial District. Simeon v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 358</cite>,

                            Jury Conversations. - Where the record established that the substance of a conversation between a juror and the court related to the juror's having "overheard something about the case," where the court excused the juror, and to insure that "no one should
                            be suspicious" about his ability to be fair and impartial, this juror was removed from the case prior to deliberations, and where no other juror indicated that he or she had overheard anything about the case, the conversation
                            between the court and the juror could not have influenced the verdict. State v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 105</cite>, 436 S.E.2d 235 (1993).

                            Jury Instruction. - Pattern jury instruction used by trial court was internally consistent and meaningful, and did not misuse the term "extenuating," nor define the term "mitigating circumstance" in such a way as to confuse jurors or violate the defendant's
                            due process and fundamental fairness rights. State v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 518</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 131 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1164, 120 S. Ct. 1181, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1087

         No Private Cause of Action for Deprivation of Speedy Trial Rights.
        </b> - Consistent with federal case law, the court declines to recognize a private cause of action in connection with the deprivation of the right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by the North Carolina Constitution;
                            since plaintiff appealed only the dismissal of his direct constitutional claim, he placed before the court no right to relief which the trial court could have recognized. Washington v. Cline, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 219

                            empowers a trial court to decline a request for declaratory relief under certain circumstances, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sVIIIa26s1-257" target="_blank">G.S. 1-257</a></cite> should not be applied
                            to thwart a properly presented constitutional challenge; the North Carolina courts are obligated to protect fundamental rights when those rights are threatened, and to that end, every person for an injury done him in his lands,
                            goods, person, or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law. Therefore, where it clearly appears either that property or fundamental human rights are denied in violation of constitutional guarantees, and where a statutory
                            provision is specifically challenged by a person directly affected by it, declaratory relief as to the constitutional validity of that provision is appropriate; in other words, when the requested declaration satisfies the recognized
                            criteria, the trial court has no discretion to decline the request. Augur v. Augur, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 582</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 125 (2002).

                            Hindrance of Others' Rights Not Justified. - The salutary principle set forth in this section does not justify the use of the courts for the assertion of fanciful rights or complaints based upon imaginary wrongs to hinder or delay others in the enjoyment
                            of rights founded upon the law and in accord with justice and fair dealing among men. Carson v. Fleming, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 600</cite>, 125 S.E. 259 (1924).

                            from the parties' failure to reach an agreement regarding pole attachment rates within 90 days, and that failure violated the company's right to establish just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory pole attachment rates within

                            outweighed by the compelling, countervailing governmental interests in prosecuting the defendant, protecting the defendant's right to a fair trial, and preserving the integrity of the ongoing or future investigation. In re

                            Standing to Bring Antitrust and Consumer Fraud Action. - Trial court erred in dismissing a consumer's action against manufacturers under N.C. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.075.html#t75a01s75-1" target="_blank">G.S. 75-1</a></cite>                            and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.075.html#t75a01s75-1" target="_blank">G.S. 75-1</a></cite>.1 pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                            N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for lack of standing because the consumer had standing to bring the antitrust and consumer fraud action; if the consumer could demonstrate that the increased ethylene propylene diene monomor elastomers
                            prices affected the price of the goods he purchased, then he would have established the type of injury to indirect purchasers that the General Assembly intended to remedy by allowing indirect purchaser suits. Teague v. Bayer

                            Supplementation of the Record. - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a neighbor's motion to supplement the record to include affidavits by the neighbor and a real estate appraiser addressing the issue of standing, when the neighbor challenged
                            a design application for a house that was submitted by landowners in a historic district, because the affidavits which the neighbor proffered as supplements added very little new substantive information to the already voluminous
                            record and would not have provided a basis for standing. Cherry v. Wiesner, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 781 S.E.2d 871, review denied, 792 S.E.2d 779, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 674 (2016).

                            The public, and especially the parties, are entitled to see and hear what goes on in the court. That the courts are open is one of the sources of their greatest strength. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>,
                            237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).

                            A criminal defendant also has the right to a public trial, a right guaranteed by this section and U.S. Const., Amends. VI and XIV. The public, and especially the parties are entitled to see and hear what goes on in the courts. State v. Callahan,
                            <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 401 S.E.2d 793 (1991).

                            In a court proceeding, all parties are entitled to be present at all stages so that they may hear the evidence and have an opportunity to refute it if they can. Raper v. Berrier, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 193</cite>, 97

                            Judge's announcement of his ruling in open court could not reasonably be characterized as a hearing, much less one at which defendant's presence was required, where judge simply took a final step in the process of deciding whether to release any part
                            of defendant's prison records to the prosecution and announced his decision from the bench. State v. Rich, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 50</cite>, 484 S.E.2d 394, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1002, 118

                            The trial and disposition of criminal cases is the public's business and ought to be conducted in public in open court. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).

                            In every criminal prosecution it is the right of the accused to be present throughout the trial, unless he waives the right. And in capital trials such rights cannot be waived by the prisoner. State v. Pope, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 326</cite>,

                            Judge's Ex Parte Communications with Jury Before Verdict. - Where, during the course of the trial, the presiding trial judge engaged in an ex parte communication with the jury, and prior to reconvening court, the judge entered the jury room where the

                            without affording him the right to offer evidence in support of his motion. State v. Moctezuma, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 90, 539 S.E.2d 52 (2000).

                            Clearing Courtroom During Testimony of Child Rape Victim. - In a prosecution for first-degree rape of a child, the constitutional right of defendant to a public trial was not violated by the court's order, entered pursuant to

                            Questioning of Child in Custody Proceeding. - Without doubt the court may question a child in open court in a custody proceeding, but it can do so privately only by consent of the parties. Cook v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                            652, 169 S.E.2d 29 (1969).

                            Exclusion of Former Attorney Not Warranted. - In a special proceeding initiated by plaintiffs for the partition of certain land held as a tenancy in common, plaintiffs' former attorney was not subject to being excluded from the courtroom merely because
                            he filed a pleading adverse to plaintiffs' interest after they had terminated his services, especially in light of the fact that the record affirmatively disclosed that he did not represent anyone or take part in or affect
                            the trial in any way. Ingram v. Craven, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 315 S.E.2d 364 (1984).

                            Judge's Warning to Restrict Public Egress Was Proper. - Where trial judge informed those in the courtroom that he was concerned that the jury would be distracted by movement of spectators in and out of the room, and where he consequently warned them that
                            if they wished to leave the courtroom, they should do so immediately, for they would not be allowed to do so after closing arguments began, barring an emergency, the order was not a denial of a public trial in violation of
                            this section since the judge did not vacate the courtroom nor bar the courtroom door without due warning to those within and without, and since the judge was authorized under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Xa59s15A-1034ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1034(a)</a></cite>                            to impose reasonable limitations on access to the courtroom.

                            Removal of Spectators from Courtroom was Justified. - Trial judge did not err in removing four spectators from the courtroom, where the evidence showed, inter alia, that the spectators were talking in the courtroom, in violation of the judge's pretrial
                            order. State v. Dean, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 180, 674 S.E.2d 453 (2009), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 376</cite>, 679 S.E.2d 139 (N.C. 2009).

                            The creation of inferior courts by the legislature has been useful in the administration of justice without "delay" in accordance with this section. Albertson v. Albertson, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.

                            A motion for a continuance is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge to be determined by him upon the facts in the exercise of his duty to administer right and justice without sale, denial, or delay. State v. Godwin,
                            <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 49</cite>, 3 S.E.2d 347 (1939).

                        <p>
                            Delay Caused by Irregular Pleading. - Under the provisions of this section an adversary party ought not to be delayed in the final adjudication of the controversy by the fact that the exceptions taken by the opposite party are so drawn as to take two
                            chances, first of a favorable decision by the court, and then of a finding in his favor by the jury. Nor ought he to be delayed because the demand for a jury trial fails to point out the precise issue as to which testimony
                            must be offered. Keystone Driller Co. v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 746</cite>, 24 S.E. 517 (1896).

                            Disregarding Attempted Appeal from Nonappealable Order. - In order to promote the principle set forth in this section, courts may disregard an attempted appeal from a nonappealable interlocutory order and proceed with trial to avoid delay. Veazey v. City
                            of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 357</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 377, reh'g denied, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 744</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 429 (1950).

                            The denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings is not immediately appealable, since otherwise a litigant could delay the administration of justice in contravention of this section. Garrett v. Rose, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 299</cite>,

                            Delay Not Wilful. - There was no showing that the prosecution wilfully or through neglect or for improper purposes delayed defendant's trial where the delay was due largely to the operation of neutral factors and not to any malevolent intent on the part
                            of the prosecution. State v. Webster, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 674</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 349 (1994).

                        <p>
                            Delay Not Found. - Plaintiff offered no evidence to support the claim that the dual role served by the Attorney General's Office both in representing defendant institution and being legal advisor to State Personnel Commission caused actual bias or unfair
                            prejudice to plaintiff, nor that it created any delay in the disposition of her claims. Dorsey v. UNC-Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 468 S.E.2d 557 (1996).

                            Right to Speedy Trial. - Every person formally accused of crime is guaranteed a speedy and impartial trial by this section and U.S. Const., Amend. VI and XIV. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242
                            S.E.2d 806 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Prisoners confined for unrelated crimes are entitled to the benefits of the constitutional guaranty of a speedy and impartial trial. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 806 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the record was unclear on what happened in the trial court between November 13, 2006 and August 26, 2008, the delay was sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing on the issue of defendant's right to a speedy trial. State v. Clark,
                            <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 689 S.E.2d 553 (2009).

                        <p>
                            The constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial does not outlaw good faith delays which are reasonably necessary for the State to prepare and present its case. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242
                            S.E.2d 806 (1978).

                            Time Period Involved in Right to Speedy Trial. - The right to a speedy trial pertains to the time period between the date of the occurrence of the alleged crime and the date when a defendant is "accused" of committing that crime, and an individual becomes
                            "accused" of a crime for the purpose of calculating the length of this delay when he is either arrested or indicted. State v. Salem, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 419, 274 S.E.2d 501,
                            cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 401</cite>, 279 S.E.2d 355 (1981).

                            Unless some fixed time limit is prescribed by statute, speedy trial questions must be resolved on a case-by-case basis. While all relevant circumstances must be considered, four interrelated factors are of primary significance: (1) the length of delay,
                            (2) the reason for the delay, (3) the extent to which defendant has asserted his right and (4) the extent to which defendant has been prejudiced. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>,
                            242 S.E.2d 806 (1978); State v. Bare, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 335 S.E.2d 748 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 392</cite>, 338 S.E.2d 881 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Undue delay which is arbitrary and oppressive or the result of deliberate prosecution efforts to hamper the defense violates the constitutional right to a speedy trial. State v. Bare, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                            516, 335 S.E.2d 748 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 392</cite>, 338 S.E.2d 881 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Defendant Causing Delay Not Denied Speedy Trial. - A criminal defendant who has caused or acquiesced in a delay will not be permitted to use it as a vehicle in which to escape justice. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>,
                            242 S.E.2d 806 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Right Must Be Asserted. - Failure to assert the right will make it difficult for a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy trial. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 806 (1978).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Defendant's failure to assert her speedy trial right sooner in the process did not foreclose her speedy trial claim, but it did weigh somewhat against her contention that she had been unconstitutionally denied a speedy trial. State v. Webster,
                            <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 674</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 349 (1994).

                        <p>
                            Burden on Defendant. - The length of a delay is not determinative of whether a violation has occurred; the issue must be resolved on the facts of each case, and the defendant has the burden of establishing that the delay was purposeful or oppressive or
                            by reasonable effort could have been avoided by the State. State v. Bare, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 335 S.E.2d 748 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 392</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether he is being deprived of such right. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 806
                            (1978).

                        <p>
                            Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by this section, since delay of two and one-half years was not inordinate, State had a legitimate reason for its delay and defendant showed no prejudice resulting from
                            the delay. State v. Avery, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 572, 383 S.E.2d 224 (1989), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 51</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 96 (1990).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, where delay was not the result of prosecutorial willfulness or neglect, and where defendant did not assert his right to a speedy trial until three years after his arrest and failed to
                            show that he was prejudiced by the delay. State v. Lundy, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 519 S.E.2d 73 (1999).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the State violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial where he failed to show that the delay of his second trial was due to the neglect or willfulness of the prosecution,
                            where he failed to assert his right in the five-year interval, and where his claim that the delay resulted in his inability to locate key witnesses was undermined by his failure to call all his witnesses in the first trial.
                            State v. Spinks, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 153, 523 S.E.2d 129 (1999).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated, although the length of delay from indictment to trial, was 3 years and 326 days, where: the delay resulted not from willful misconduct but from the appointment of substitute defense counsel and
                            changes in prosecutors; the State only refused to comply with discovery requests by defendant when these concerned evidence or information to which he was not statutorily entitled; and defendant's continual refusal to cooperate
                            in the preparation of his defense resulted in the withdrawal of counsel nearly two years after the indictment. State v. Grooms, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 50</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 713 (2000), cert.
                            denied, 534 U.S. 838, 122 S. Ct. 93, 151 L. Ed. 2d 54 (2001).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The defendant, whose trial was delayed approximately four and a half years, was not denied his constitutional right under this section where: the local docket was congested with capital cases; the prosecutor's decisions pertaining to scheduling and trial
                            order were not based upon unconstitutional factors, rather the delay was due to neutral factors; the defendant's actions were not consistent with a desire for speedy trial; and although the investigator had died, the State
                            presented other investigators who testified to the same events and observations sought by defendant, and gave the defendant the opportunity to impress upon the jury the absence of the detective best able to testify as to certain
                            events and observations. State v. Hammonds, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 541 S.E.2d 166 (2000).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant was not denied the right to a speedy trial on a rape conviction, as defendant's excessive post-accusation incarceration before trial was outweighed by defendant's inability to prove neglect or willfulness by the prosecutor combined with a lack
                            of allegation or proof of prejudice. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 581, 570 S.E.2d 898 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 65</cite>, - S.E.2d -
                            (2003), cert. dismissed, - N.C. - , 602 S.E.2d 679 (2004).

                        <p>
                            Appellate court did not err in affirming the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss arguing his speedy trial right was violated as application of the four-factor Barker test did not show that the four-year delay between defendant's indictment
                            for the killing of another man and his plea bargain to second-degree murder right before trial was the result of the State's inaction or unreasonableness; rather, the evidence showed that the trial court had a crowded docket
                            regarding murder charges and that defendant was not prejudice by the delay, and thus, denial of the motion to dismiss was not error. State v. Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 114</cite>, 579
                            S.E.2d 251 (2003).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There was no error in denying defendant's motion to dismiss because defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated even though almost two years passed between the date of the offenses and trial; defendant failed to demonstrate actual
                            or substantial prejudice resulting from the delay as he alleged only anxiety and concern, and also failed to meet his burden of showing that the reason for the delay was the neglect or willfulness of the prosecution. State
                            v. Doisey, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 590 S.E.2d 886 (2004).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss for denial of a speedy trial, pursuant to his rights under U.S. Const., Amend. VI and N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 18, as the 20-month delay was presumptively prejudicial and defendant had asserted his right to a speedy trial, but the reason was attributable to the trial court's case load, which was not due to neglect or willfulness
                            by the State, and to the multiple continuances granted to defendant, and he failed to show that he was prejudiced thereby. State v. Dorton, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 759, 617 S.E.2d 97, cert. denied,
                            <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 69</cite>, 623 S.E.2d 775 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 18 and U.S. Const., Amend. VI was not violated because, although a delay of three years and seven months from arrest to trial was exceptionally long, defendant's right to a speedy trial was not impaired as defendant
                            demonstrated no prejudice whatsoever from the delay and he was not incarcerated during the delay; indeed, he moved to another state during the delay. State v. McBride, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 496, 653 S.E.2d
                            218 (2007).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant failed to demonstrate that the dismissal of the driving while impaired charge and subsequent refiling violated his due process or speedy trial rights, because defendant did not assert the right until his appeal from the district court to the
                            superior court and the reasons for the delay were attributable as much to defendant as to the State. State v. Friend, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 338, 724 S.E.2d 85 (2012).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant failed to show a violation of defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial under N.C. Const. art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 18 because, although the nearly three and one-half year delay between defendant's indictment and his trial was long and defendant's prolonged pre-trial incarceration necessarily caused him hardship, the delay was
                            not caused by the prosecution's neglect or willful misconduct. The evidence tended to show that the changes in defendant's representation caused much of the delay. State v. Kpaeyeh, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite>                            694, 784 S.E.2d 582 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant's speedy trial claim failed, because, while the delay of nearly 28 months between defendant's arrest and trial raised a questions of reasonableness, some delay was due to defendant's indecision about counsel, issues regarding communication with
                            counsel, and counsel's scheduling conflicts, and the backlog at the crime lab was a neutral reason for the delay, as defendant failed to show the prosecution or the crime lab underutilized resources available to prepare the
                            case for trial. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 795 S.E.2d 126 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated despite the 63-month delay, the delay was due to crowded dockets and earlier pending cases, defendant did not assert the right until almost five years after his arrest, and there was no evidence defendant's
                            ability to defend the case was impaired by the delay. State v. Farmer, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 822 S.E.2d 556 (2018).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated despite the seven-year delay between his arrest and trial; most of the delay was attributable to defendant and he failed to establish that the delay prejudiced his defense. State v. Spinks,
                            - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (May 18, 2021).

                        <p>
                            Defendant Denied Right to Speedy Trial. - Where defendant's case did not occur until nearly three years from the date of arrest for trafficking in cocaine by transporting cocaine, and during that time the case was placed on the trial calendar thirty-one
                            times, but never called by the district attorney, and essential witness was no longer available at time of trial, defendant suffered substantial prejudice, and was denied his right to a speedy trial. State v. Chaplin,
                            <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 659, 471 S.E.2d 653 (1996).

                            Defendant's right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 18 was violated where, inter alia, the record showed: (1) that much of the over four-year delay between defendant's arrest and defendant's trial was caused by the State's failure to submit evidence to the State Bureau
                            of Investigation lab to be examined for over three years; (2) that the State's failure to request a comparison of the evidence to a person the State was notified might have been the guilty party; (3) defendant formally asserted
                            defendant's right to a speedy trial more than a year and a half before the trial began; and (4) the delay in bringing defendant to trial prejudiced defendant, as, inter alia, defendant was incarcerated for 366 days prior to
                            trial. State v. Washington, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 277, 665 S.E.2d 799 (2008).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the State's only evidence to rebut the prima facie showing of a violation of defendant's right to a speedy trial was erroneously admitted in violation of defendant's attorney-client privilege, and without that evidence, the State could not carry
                            its burden of attempting to explain the trial delay, defendant's motion should have been allowed, as the erroneous admission of the State's evidence had a probable impact on a jury finding defendant guilty and the trial court
                            plainly erred in allowing the attorney to testify against his former client. State v. Khalil Abdul Farook, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 20, 2020).

                        <p>
                            Balancing the four factors enunciated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d. 101 (1972), defendant was not denied the right to a speedy trial and there was no reasonable probability that had counsel advanced a motion to dismiss
                            based on denial of that right, the result of the proceeding would have been different. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 478 S.E.2d 16 (1996).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Analysis Required. - Speedy trial issue was remanded where the trial court had ruled on defendant's pro se motion, but had not considered all of the Barker factors or made appropriate findings. State v. Sheridan, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite>                            697, 824 S.E.2d 146 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Where there was some prejudice to defendant caused by the delay in her trial, the weight of it in the balancing process was diminished by the absence of any impairment to her defense against the criminal charge and the absence of substantial pretrial
                            incarceration. State v. Webster, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 674</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 349 (1994).

                            Foreign Custody and Absence of Prejudice as Factors in Denying Speedy Trial Violation. - Defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial by the delay between his indictment in November, 1977 and his trial in July, 1979, where he was either in federal
                            custody or in custody in South Carolina except from February to September, 1978 and March to July, 1979, and the remaining time fell short of denying defendant his constitutional right to a speedy trial because there was no
                            evidence that any of the delay for which this State was responsible prejudiced his case or his ability to present his defense. State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 534</cite>, 268 S.E.2d
                            161 (1980).

                            Property and Liberty Interest in Requiring Agency to Comply with Policies and Procedures. - Trial court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of a city because a police officer alleged a valid property and liberty interest in requiring
                            the city to comply with its established promotional process; the officer sufficiently alleged constitutional claims, and genuine issues of material fact remained. Tully v. City of Wilmington,
                            <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 204, 790 S.E.2d 854 (2016), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, remanded, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 527</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 208, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 65 (N.C. 2018).

                            Sovereign Immunity. - Sovereign immunity was not available as a defense to the claims of temporary employees that were brought directly under the North Carolina Constitution against state agencies and employees. Sanders v. State Pers. Comm'n,
                            <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 15, 644 S.E.2d 10 (2007).

                            Federal Decisions Do Not Control Interpretation by North Carolina Supreme Court. - Decisions by the federal courts as to the construction and effect of the due process clause of the United States Constitution are binding on the North Carolina Supreme
                            Court; however, such decisions, although persuasive, do not control an interpretation by the North Carolina Supreme Court of this section. The North Carolina Supreme Court will therefore make an independent determination of
                            the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs under this section. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Claims asserted in the State Court on the basis of the North Carolina Constitution were not identical to the claims asserted by the plaintiff in the Federal Court on the basis of freedom of speech and press under the United States Constitution and dismissal
                            of the state claims on the basis of res judicata was error. Evans v. Cowan, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 181, 468 S.E.2d 575, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 510</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Other State Remedies Must Be Exhausted. - A state constitutional action is not proper under this section, unless no other state remedy is available; here, an existing state tort remedy precluded plaintiff's assault-based constitutional claim against an
                            arresting officer. Glenn-Robinson v. Acker, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 538 S.E.2d 601 (2000).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Individual's constitutional claims against the sheriff, the sheriff's department, the county, and the detective, based upon the stopping, searching, and detaining of the individual and the retention of his property, were dismissed because the existing
                            common law remedies of false imprisonment, trespass to chattels, and negligence were appropriate alternatives under the facts alleged in the complaint and waiver of governmental immunity was not pleaded. Seaton v. Owens, -
                            F. Supp. 2d - (M.D.N.C. Dec. 8, 2003).
                        </p>
                        <p>

         II. DUE PROCESS AND THE "LAW OF THE LAND".
        </b>
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            "Law of the Land" - The "law of the land" clause itself means that such legislative acts as profess in themselves directly to punish persons, or to deprive the citizen of his property, without trial before the judicial tribunals, and a decision upon the
                            matter of right, as determined by the laws under which it vested, according to the course, mode and usages of the common law as derived from our forefathers, are not effectually "laws of the land" for those purposes. Hoke v.
                            Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. 1</cite> (1833); State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 538</cite>, 15 S.E. 261 (1892).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The term "law of the land" means the general law; a law which hears before it condemns; which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial. The meaning is that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property and immunities under the
                            protection of the general rules which govern society. Everything which may pass under the form of an enactment is not, therefore, to be considered the "law of the land." State ex rel. Caldwell v. Wilson,

                        <p>
                            The term "law of the land" means the general law, the law which hears before it condemns; which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial. It means the regular course of the administration of justice through the courts of competent
                            jurisdiction, after the manner of such courts. Procedure must be consistent with the fundamental principles of liberty and justice. State v. Chesson, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 259</cite>, 45
                            S.E.2d 563 (1947), writ dismissed, 334 U.S. 806, 68 S. Ct. 1185, 92 L. Ed. 1739 (1948). See also, Eason v. Spence, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 579</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 717 (1950).

                            "Law of the land" clause of this section incorporates protections similar to those provided by the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution. State v. Ballenger, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 179,

         Wrongful Death Claim Precluded Constitutional Claim.
        </b> - The court dismissed the plaintiff-decedent's relative's claim that defendants, sheriff's deputies, violated the decedent's and his family's rights to substantive due process guaranteed by Article 1 of the North
                            Carolina Constitution where a wrongful death claim could compensate the plaintiff for the same injuries or death as the state constitutional law claim. Olvera v. Edmundson, 151 F. Supp. 2d 700 (W.D.N.C. 2001).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Daughter's Corum claims against a county Division of Social Services for negligence, wrongful death, and denial of due process was dismissed because the daughter had an adequate less intrusive remedy against the state Department of Health and Human Services
                            in the Industrial Commission, as (1) adequacy depended on recovery without regard to the party from whom recovery might be obtained, (2) both claims arose out of the same facts and sought recovery for the same injuries, (3)
                            the daughter was not denied access to the "courthouse doors," and (4) the limited damages available in the Industrial Commission, as compared to damages available in a trial court, resulted from the General Assembly's determination
                            of what recovery was adequate for claims within the Industrial Commission's jurisdiction. Taylor v. Wake Cty., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 811 S.E.2d 648 (2018), appeal dismissed,

                            The "law of the land" requires that the administration of justice be consistent with fundamental principles of liberty and justice. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).

                            Requires Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard. - Among other things, "the law of the land" or "due process of law" imports both notice and the opportunity to be heard before a competent tribunal. Parker v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite>                            747, 225 S.E.2d 632 (1976); Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C.

                            The "law of the land" clause contained in this section mandates that a party be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before he or she can be deprived of a legal claim or defense. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Rolfe,

                            Mother's motion regarding custody and child support asked the trial court to enter an order modifying and increasing child support and to instruct the father to pay the ordered support each month without deductions; this notice clearly apprised the father
                            that the hearing would include child support issues, including arrearages, and satisfied due process. Swanson v. Herschel, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 803, 622 S.E.2d 159 (2005).

                            Trial court erred in setting aside a pre-trial order, upon its own motion, prior to entry of an equitable distribution judgment because the order was entered in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-21ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 50-21(d)</a></cite>                            and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C.

                            aside the order containing the parties' binding stipulations, and the court failed to give either party notice of its intent to set aside the order, N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            In substantive law, due process may be characterized as a standard of reasonableness, and as such it is a limitation upon the exercise of the police power. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d

         No Substantive Due Process Claim Stated.
        </b> - Plaintiffs' substantive due process claim failed to state a claim for numerous reasons; to the extent plaintiffs sought payment under an agreement with a risk-management program provided by the North Carolina
                            School Board's Trust, and claimed that the county school board violated substantive due process in not paying their claim, plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted as the Trust was responsible for
                            determining the merits of and paying any claim. Plaintiffs failed to make any allegation of any egregious or outrageous action on the part of the board for failing to pay plaintiffs and plaintiffs' substantive due process claim
                            failed as a matter of law under rational basis review; and plaintiffs failed to allege the existence of a right that the board violated in failing to pay plaintiffs. Frye v. Brunswick County Bd. of Educ., 612 F. Supp. 2d 694

                            There was no substantive due process right violated in the trial court's decision to affirm the decision of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, (DHHS) to decertify a corporation as a provider of HIV case
                            management services because the trial court perceived that the corporation's lack of proper progress notes prevented DHHS from being able to accurately account for funds allotted by the Division of Medical Services for the
                            program of public assistance, and given that the problem was evident in all four case managers at the corporation, decertification would ensure that funds provided for public assistance would be protected; the trial court's
                            decision was rationally related to the <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.108A.html#t108Aa02s108A-25ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 108A-25(b)</a></cite> goal of providing a program of public
                            assistance, as supported by the trial court's findings of fact, conclusions of law and substantial record evidence, and the corporation did not challenge the validity of any statute or rules but contended that the traditional
                            substantive due process test had to be applied to invalidate the trial court's adjudicatory decision. Bradley-Reid Corp. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 689 S.E.2d 494 (2009).

                            In a case where a law enforcement officer's certification was suspended for 180 days, there was no substantive due process violation because the time of the suspension did not amount to a shock to the conscious where the officer knowingly and willfully
                            falsified training records; moreover, the suspension was not arbitrary because preserving the credibility of law enforcement was a valid state objective, and the suspension was rationally related to that objective. Krueger

                            A decision of the Supreme Court of the United States construing the due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, although persuasive, does not control an interpretation by the Supreme Court of this State of the "law of the land" clause in this section.

                            The North Carolina Law of the Land Clause is generally considered the equivalent of the Due Process Clause and has been interpreted as requiring that neither property nor liberty may be deprived but by the general law; although a decision of the United
                            States Supreme Court construing the Due Process Clause is persuasive in interpreting a claim brought under the North Carolina Law of the Land Clause, it is not controlling. Lorbacher v. Housing Auth.,

                            To the extent that plaintiff sought to challenge his discharge from state employment under the law of the land clause of the North Carolina constitution, that claim required a property interest, and because plaintiff lacked a property interest in his
                            employment under state law (plaintiff was an employee at will), such a claim failed. Whitesell v. Town of Morrisville, 446 F. Supp. 2d 419 (E.D.N.C. 2006).

                            Former employee alleged that he had a property interest in continued employment with the City, as created by the City's policy and adopted by ordinance, and that the City violated his due process rights by failing to provide him certain appeal rights
                            following the termination of his employment; however, the employee remained an at-will employee, and the City did not create a property right in his employment when the City adopted the policy. Because the employee had no enforceable
                            property interest, it was unnecessary to address whether the City followed the procedures in the policy; as with the employee's federal due process claim, the absence of a protected property interest doomed the employee's claim

                            insofar as they related to matters to which the investigator testified; by allowing its investigator to testify in defendant's disciplinary hearing, the State Bar waived any immunity under the attorney-work product doctrine

                            Because a buyer was a good faith purchaser for value, and because the homeowner received constitutionally sufficient notice of the foreclosure sale, the trial court abused its discretion in voiding the order of foreclosure and in canceling the deed to
                            the buyer; the failure to effectuate service was not a material irregularity where the homeowner experienced at least two previous foreclosures on the same property and was familiar with the procedure. In re Proposed Foreclosure

                            Commitment Proceedings. - An order for the commitment of a person to a mental hospital is essentially a judgment by which he is deprived of his liberty, and it is a cardinal principle of English jurisprudence that before any judgment can be pronounced
                            against a person there must have been a trial of the issue upon which the judgment is given. In re Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 593</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 489 (1962).

                            Parental Rights. - Trial court's factual finding that the father was fit to raise his minor child did not preclude the trial court from making the legal conclusion that the father, in engaging in conduct constituting abandonment and neglect of the minor
                            child, acted in a manner inconsistent with his constitutionally-protected status as a parent; however, the trial court erred because it was required to find the existence of that conduct by clear and convincing evidence, which

                            not fall within the class of protected fathers who could claim a liberty interest in developing a relationship with the child, his consent to the adoption of the child was not necessary, and the adoption chapter was not unconstitutional

                            Rate Hearings. - The Utilities Commission must determine a petition for an increase in telephone rates on the basis of the facts existing at the time such increase is effective, and if a subsequent change in conditions warrants a new rate, such new rate
                            must relate to the date of change and the parties must be accorded an opportunity to be heard with respect to the effect, if any, such change had on the rate structure; a denial of such opportunity would be a deprivation of

                            Due Process Denied When Decision of Whether Probation Should be Revoked is Delegated to Victim. - Trial court's judgment revoking defendant's probation imposed upon his conviction for obtaining property by false pretenses violated the minimum requirements
                            of due process because the trial court improperly abdicated its discretionary authority to determine whether probation should be revoked and, instead, delegated to the victim the authority of determining whether revocation
                            was proper by stating that it would continue defendant on probation only if the victim agreed to that course of action. State v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 610 S.E.2d

                            not violate the defendant's substantive due process rights, and the monitoring was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose; the defendant's participation in an SBM program following the defendant's conviction
                            for an aggravated offense, forcible rape, did not infringe upon any fundamental right, and by statute, the defendant was subject to SBM for life. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. App.</cite>                            201, 761 S.E.2d 662 (2014).

                            Two-tiered Equal Protection Analysis. - Courts employ a two-tiered scheme of analysis when an equal protection claim is made. When a governmental act classifies persons in terms of their ability to exercise a fundamental right, or when a governmental
                            classification distinguishes between persons in terms of any right, upon some "suspect" basis, the upper tier of equal protection analysis is employed. Calling for "strict scrutiny," this standard requires the government to
                            demonstrate that the classification is necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest. When an equal protection claim does not involve a "suspect class" or a fundamental right, the lower tier of equal protection analysis
                            is employed. This mode of analysis merely requires that distinctions which are drawn by a challenged statute or action bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate governmental interest. Abbott v. Town of Highlands,

                            County citizens stated a claim by alleging that a board of education redistricting plan violated the one person, one vote principle by discriminating between urban and rural voters and against Democratic incumbents; the district court erred in finding
                            that the claim was nonjusticiable in the absence of any North Carolina case law supporting such a finding. Wright v. North Carolina, 787 F.3d 256 (4th Cir. 2015).

                            The legislature may make classifications and distinctions in the application of laws provided they are reasonable and just and not arbitrary. Motley v. State Bd. of Barber Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 337</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Legislative bodies may make classifications for the application of regulations, provided the classifications are practicable and apply equally to all persons within a class, since the constitutional mandate proscribing discrimination requires only that
                            there be no inequality among those within a particular group or class. State v. Trantham, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 641</cite>, 55 S.E.2d 198 (1949).

                        <p>
                            Legislative bodies may distinguish, select, and classify objects of legislation. It suffices if the classification is practical. They may prescribe different regulations for different classes, and discrimination as between classes is not such as to invalidate
                            the legislative enactment. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).

                            A state may classify in a statute with reference to the evil to be prevented, and if the class discriminated against is or reasonably might be considered to define those from whom the evil mainly is to be feared, it properly may be picked out. The State
                            may direct its law against what it deems the evil as it actually exists without covering the whole field of possible abuses. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>,

                            There is no constitutional requirement that a regulation, in other respects permissible, must reach every class to which it might be applied, that is, that the legislature must be held rigidly to the choice of regulating all or none. Raleigh Mobile Home

                            Neither the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV nor the similar language in this section takes from the State the power to classify persons or activities when there is reasonable basis for such classification and for the consequent difference

                            Equal protection clauses do not require perfection in respect of classifications. In borderline cases, the legislative determination is entitled to great weight. Lamb v. Wedgewood S. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 419</cite>,

                            In the area of economics and social welfare, a state does not violate the equal protection clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. If the classification has some "reasonable basis," it does not offend the Constitution
                            simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality. Glusman v. Trustees of Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 629</cite>,

                            To withstand an equal protection claim a statute's classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest on some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced
                            shall be treated alike. North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 195 S.E.2d 357 (1973).

                            The traditional equal-protection test does not require the very best classification in the light of a legislative or regulatory purpose; however, it does require that such classification in relation to such purpose attain a minimum (undefined and undefinable)
                            level of rationality. Glusman v. Trustees of Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 629</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 213 (1972), vacated on other grounds, 412 U.S. 947, 93 S. Ct. 2999, 37 L. Ed. 2d 999

                            Legislative classifications will be upheld provided the classification is founded upon reasonable distinctions, affects all persons similarly situated or engaged in the same business without discrimination, and has some reasonable relation to the public

                            This section requires that if a class is created there must be a reasonable basis for such classification and the consequent difference in treatment under the law. This means that the creation of the class must be reasonably related to the accomplishment
                            of some purpose which the legislature has the power to reach. Durham Council of Blind v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 339 S.E.2d 84, cert. denied and appeal dismissed,

                            The equal protection clauses of the United States and North Carolina Constitutions impose upon law-making bodies the requirement that any legislative classification be based on differences that are reasonably related to the purposes of the act in which
                            it is found. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 8 (1972); North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 701,

                            In the area of economics and social welfare, a statute containing a legislative classification which is rationally related to a legitimate state objective does not violate this section or the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. The traditional
                            equal-protection test does not require the very best classification in the light of a legislative or regulatory purpose, but does require that such classification in relation to such purpose attain a minimum (undefined and

                            Legislature's Classification will be Presumed Valid. - Although the reasonableness of a particular classification is a question for the court, there is a presumption that the classification is valid, because such classifications are largely matters of
                            legislative judgment. Therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment of what is reasonable for that of the legislative body, particularly when the reasonableness of a particular classification is fairly debatable. Lamb

                            Protection Against Unreasonable Discrimination Extends to Administration and Execution of Laws. - The provisions of the "law of the land" clause of the Constitution of North Carolina and U.S. Const., Amend. XIV afford protection against discriminatory
                            actions of officials in administering the law. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 419</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 109 (1964).

                            The constitutional protection in this section against unreasonable discrimination under color of law is not limited to the enactment of legislation. It extends also to the administration and the execution of laws valid on their face. S.S. Kresge Co. v.

                            illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, this denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Davis,

                            Nor does selective enforcement have that effect if it has a reasonable relation to the purpose of the legislation, such as making efficient use of police manpower by concentrating upon the major sources of the criminal activity. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Davis,

                            Judicial Districts. - Expressive conduct, which combines elements of a fundamental right with conduct generally subject to regulation reviewed only for a rational basis, is analogous to judicial elections, in that such elections combine representative
                            and nonrepresentative aspects; therefore, a similar standard of intermediate scrutiny is applied when considering equal protection challenges to judicial districts, and judicial districts will be sustained if the legislature's
                            formulations advance important governmental interests unrelated to vote dilution and do not weaken voter strength substantially more than necessary to further those interests. Blankenship v. Bartlett,

                            Superior Court Elections Subject to Heightened Level of Scrutiny. - Judicial elections have a component that implicates the fundamental right to vote and a separate component that is ordinarily the province of the legislature, subject only to review for
                            rationality by the courts, and because the right to vote on equal terms for representatives triggers heightened scrutiny, even as the nonrepresentative aspects inherent in the role of the judiciary preclude strict scrutiny
                            on a one-person, one-vote standard, neither rational basis nor strict scrutiny is an appropriate standard of review; the right to vote in superior court elections on substantially equal terms is a quasi-fundamental right which
                            is subject to a heightened level of scrutiny, and the Equal Protection Clause, N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            the matter was remanded to the trial court remand to the trial court with orders to hold a new hearing and determine whether the State could meet its burden of demonstrating significant interests that justified the legislature's

                            districts advances a compelling state interest; hence the trial court would be directed on remand of action challenging 2001 legislative redistricting plans to afford the opportunity to establish, at an evidentiary hearing,

                            impact African American voters to their detriment, and enjoining the voter-ID provisions furthered the public interest, which favored permitting as many qualified voters to vote as possible. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App. - ,

                            Voters showed the need for a statewide preliminary injunction barring legislators from implementing or enforcing the voter-ID provisions of Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) as to all North Carolina voters pending a ruling on the merits of the voters' facial
                            challenge under the North Carolina Constitution because the alleged violation, the alleged facial unconstitutionality of S.B. 824, impacted the entire State of North Carolina. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App. - , 840 S.E.2d 244

                            Voters made a sufficient preliminary showing that even if the General Assembly followed its rules, the process employed in enacting Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) was nevertheless unusual because sixty-one of the legislators who voted in favor of S.B. 824
                            had previously voted to enact a law thatwas struck down as motivated by a discriminatory intent; S.B. 824 was passed in a short timeframe by a lame-duck-Republican supermajority, which showed an intent to push through legislation.

                            the voters presented some evidence suggesting the General Assembly refused to obtain updated data on the effects of S.B. 824's voter-ID provisions, instead relying on outdated data, and chose not to include certain types of

                            Teachers' equal protection allegations against the school board, even when assumed correct and construed most favorably, merely expressed disconcert with actions wholly consistent with the school board's authority under state law; because the teachers
                            failed to allege an essential element of an equal protection claim - namely, arbitrary or irrational state action - their equal protection claims were properly dismissed.

                            Even though a student failed to preserve an equal protection challenge to a suspension by failing to assign error or present authority, the argument was meritless at any rate under arbitrary and capricious review because there was a gender-neutral reason

                            Judge's Comment Did Not Deprive Defendant of Fair Trial. - Trial judge's remarks, prompting the prosecutor to elicit an identification from the victim, did not deprive defendant of a fair trial; by raising the issue while the victim was still on the stand,
                            the trial court avoided inconvenience to the victim and the waste of judicial resources in having the State later seek to recall the victim or reopen its case. State v.

                            was arrested at 9:00 a.m. by officers without a warrant, and after his interview concluded at 2:53 p.m., a magistrate issued warrants charging him with drug offenses, murder, and robbery; that satisfied the requirement that
                            a magistrate promptly determine probable cause. State v. Caudill, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 742 S.E.2d 268 (2013), dismissed and review denied, 747 S.E.2d 578, 2013 N.C. LEXIS

                            Delays in Bond Hearing and Release Held Constitutional. - Neither the delay in receiving a bond hearing nor the additional time defendant was required to remain in custody after the hearing violated the defendant's due process rights or

                            detained another five hours before being released on a $1,000 unsecured bond. There was no evidence that an arbitrary limit was placed on the time defendant would be held in detention before seeing a judge; defendant was brought
                            before a judge as soon as one was available; and the additional five-hour detention was not unreasonable. State v. Gilbert, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 535 S.E.2d 94 (2000).

                            No Right to Inspect Files of State Bureau of Investigation. - Where there was no contention that anything in the files of the State Bureau of Investigation was admitted into evidence and the record showed that no member of the Bureau testified during
                            the trial, defendants' contention that they were entitled to an inspection of the files of the Bureau in regard to its investigation of the case was untenable, and denial of their petition for such inspection did not violate
                            any of their rights under this section, or under U.S. Const., Amends. V, VI, VII and XIV. State v. Goldberg, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 181</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 334, cert. denied, 377 U.S. 978,

                            Promise by Police Officer. - Police officer's promise not to prosecute the defendant as an habitual offender was just as capable of implicating the defendant's constitutional rights as a promise made by a prosecutor, once the right to counsel had attached
                            or custodial interrogation begun, and the protections of due process necessarily arose. State v. Sturgill, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 629, 469 S.E.2d 557 (1996).

                            Defendant's right to prepare a defense was violated when the trial court, after ordering the State to turn over test-fired bullets and underlying data examinations for a defense ballistics examination, upon the State's revelation that it had lost the
                            original shells, refused to require the State to retest the weapon in question and allowed the State's ballistics expert to testify. State v. Canady, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 242</cite>, 559

                            Defendant's statutory sexual offense conviction was reversed and he was granted a new trial because the sealed portion of a department of social services file subpoenaed by defendant provided an alternative explanation for the victim's abuse; the file
                            showed that: (1) the victim's brother had a history of violence, (2) the mother had left the victim alone with the brother, (3) the victim had lied in the past in meetings with a social worker, (4) the mother believed that
                            she might have caused one of the victim's injuries, and (5) the mother believed that it was possible that the brother had sexually abused the victim. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite>                            854, 599 S.E.2d 599 (2004).

                            Defendant's Right to Testify. - Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to reopen the case after defendant reconsidered his decision not to testify because the trial court had repeatedly asked defendant if he wished to testify, gave
                            him the opportunity to talk to counsel, and defendant indicated that he did not want to testify. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 823 S.E.2d 892 (2019).

                            When the State destroyed a knife that was involved in defendant's alleged crimes after defendant's convictions were affirmed, defendant's due process rights were not violated because (1) defendant never claimed the evidence was destroyed in bad faith,
                            and, (2) despite the knife's unavailability, defense counsel was able to elicit impeaching testimony from the State's witnesses concerning the knife. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 488</cite>,

                            the court suggested alternative means to obtaining such information on jurors, and the defendant's counsel did not subsequently object to the trial court's action or move for funds with which the defense could run its own criminal

                            The fact that the prosecuting attorney reads the charges or fairly summarizes them to the defendant before the jury is not a violation of defendant's right to due process and equal protection as required by the Constitutions of this State and the United

                            Defendant was not entitled to a new trial due to the State's improper closing argument which was sufficiently close to making an association between defendant and a wild animal to lead to such an inference, including a statement that "he who hunts with
                            the pack is responsible for the kill," multiple references to hunting on the African plain when defendant was an African-American, and references to an accomplice as an "alpha male" and to defendant as a follower in the pack,
                            as: (1) the State did not misstate the evidence or the law in making its argument, (2) the trial court instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence, (3) there was an abundance of evidence, both physical and
                            testimonial, that defendant was guilty of the crimes charged, and (4) although improper, the State's comments did not deny defendant due process. State v. Sims, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite>                            183, 588 S.E.2d 55 (2003).

                            to the specific date charged in the indictment, where a contextual reading of the record made it clear that the jury's consideration of the crime was restricted to defendant's actions on or about March 24, 1978, the record
                            revealed nothing indicating that defendant was surprised or hampered by any attempt of the State to alter the date charged in the bill of indictment, and defendant squarely met the State's evidence concerning his actions on

                            Setting Aside of Judgment on Negotiated Plea Held Error. - Where negotiated plea had been adjudicated and sentence had been imposed, no valid reason had been offered by the State to set aside that plea and adjudication, and defendant could not again be
                            tried for the charges which underlied the indictments without twice being placed in jeopardy, trial judge's setting aside of the judgment which had been entered on the negotiated plea agreement was error. State v. Johnson,

         Showing Required of Defendant Deprived of Right to Appeal.
        </b> - When a defendant has been deprived of his right to a complete and effective appeal, he need not demonstrate that he was prejudiced or that he has arguable grounds for a successful appeal; thus, in determining
                            whether the defendant's constitutional rights have been violated, the court should not examine the merits of the issues to be raised in a belated appeal. Galloway v. Stephenson, 510 F. Supp. 840 (M.D.N.C. 1981).

         Remedy When Defendant Is Denied Right of Appeal.

                            however, should the State be unable to secure for petitioner a belated appeal, it could, nevertheless, also correct the violation by vacating the conviction and granting petitioner another trial and appeal. Galloway v. Stephenson,

                            Injunctive Relief Against Enforcement of Ordinance by Criminal Prosecution. - Nothing else appearing, the enforcement of an ordinance by the criminal prosecution of those who violate it will not be enjoined in a suit brought by an acknowledged violator,
                            whose contention is that the ordinance is invalid or that it is administered or enforced in a discriminatory manner in violation of the equal protection of the laws. His right to present this defense at his trial on the criminal
                            charge, or to maintain a civil action for damages, constitutes an adequate remedy at law. Where, however, a plaintiff's legitimate business is threatened with destruction, through an announced purpose of making repeated arrests
                            of his employees or customers and charging them with the violation of an allegedly invalid law, a suit for injunctive relief is an appropriate procedure for testing the equal protection constitutionality of the law or of the

                            circumstance. The trial court's instruction specifically referred to each of the alleged mental disorders - his "personality disorder," "borderline range of intelligence," and "long-term, chronic and severe abuse of crack-cocaine
                            at and around the time of the offenses" - and instructed the jury to consider whether one or all of them impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law. State v. Roseboro,

                            exercise of clemency power are not reviewable beyond the minimal safeguards applied to state clemency procedures by Woodard. Bacon v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 696</cite>, 549 S.E.2d 840

                            Petit juries must be drawn from a source fairly representative of the community; however, petit juries actually chosen need not mirror the community nor reflect the various distinctive groups in the population. State v. Davis,

                            him to find the death penalty warranted under any circumstances; that his religious beliefs would substantially impair his duty as a juror to recommend to the trial court a punishment of death if the evidence warranted it;

                            The erroneous allowance of an improper challenge for cause does not entitle the adverse party to a new trial, so long as only those who are competent and qualified to serve are actually empaneled upon the jury which tried his case. State v. Bernard,
                            <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 321</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 327 (1975).

                            Test for Determining Discrimination. - The test is not whether a member of defendant's race did or did not serve on the grand jury in question, nor is it whether there has been discrimination in the selection of other grand juries in the past. The determinative
                            question is whether, in the selection of the grand jury which returned the indictment under attack, there was or was not systematic and arbitrary exclusion of qualified members of defendant's race, either in the composition
                            of the jury box from which the grand jury was drawn or in the drawing therefrom of the grand jury in question. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).

                        <p>
                            Opportunity to Prove. - Whether or not the defendant can establish alleged racial discrimination in the drawing and selection of the grand jury, due process of law demands that he have his day in court on this matter, and such day he does not have, unless
                            he has a reasonable opportunity and time to investigate and produce his evidence, if he has any. State v. Covington, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 495</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 822 (1963); State v. Inman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 311</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 613 (1963).

                        <p>
                            One who is indicted for a criminal offense must have a fair opportunity to have it determined by adequate and timely procedure whether members of his race, legally qualified to serve as jurors, have been intentionally excluded on account of their race
                            or color from the grand jury returning the indictment. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 380</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 897 (1968).

                            Burden of proving discriminatory jury practices is upon defendant, but this does not relieve the prosecuting attorney of the duty of going forward with the evidence when the defendant has made out a prima facie case. State v. Wilson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 419</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 109 (1964).

                        <p>
                            The burden is upon the defendant to establish racial discrimination alleged in his motion to quash the indictment. However, once a prima facie case is made out, the burden shifts to the prosecution. State v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 556</cite>,
                            164 S.E.2d 457 (1968).

                        <p>
                            Prima Facie Showing. - Where, at a hearing upon a motion to quash the bill of indictment, there was a showing that a substantial percentage of the population of the county from which the grand jury that returned the bill was drawn was black, and that
                            no blacks, or only a token number, had served on the grand juries of the county over a long period of time, such showing made out a prima facie case of systematic exclusion of blacks from service on the grand jury because of
                            race. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 419</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 109 (1964).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While neither a showing that, over a substantial period of time, in a county with a relatively large black population, only a few blacks had served on juries, nor a showing that the race of the persons whose names appeared on scrolls in the jury box was
                            designated on such scrolls, was conclusive proof of arbitrary and systematic exclusion of blacks from the grand jury which indicted the defendant, such showing did constitute a prima facie showing of the discrimination forbidden
                            by the law of this State, and cast upon the State the burden to go forward with evidence sufficient to overcome it. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While it was not enough for the defendant to show that the names which went into the jury box were taken originally from a source which disclosed the race of the persons named in such source material, where the defendant also showed that throughout a
                            substantial period of years, in which essentially the same procedures were used in compiling jury lists, there was repeatedly a marked discrepancy between the number of blacks drawn for grand jury service and the number of
                            blacks whose names appeared on the source material, such circumstances made out a prima facie case of unconstitutional discrimination in the selection of the grand jury which indicted the defendant, and upon such showing, the
                            burden fell to the State to go forward with competent evidence to rebut such prima facie case. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 380</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 897 (1968).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Overcoming Prima Facie Showing. - To overcome a prima facie case of systematic discrimination because of race, there must be a showing by competent evidence that the institution and management of the jury system of the county is not in fact discriminatory.
                            And if there is contradictory and conflicting evidence, the trial judge must make findings as to all material facts. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 419</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 109 (1964).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just as a showing that no blacks served on the particular grand jury which returned the bill of indictment does not make the bill of indictment invalid, so a showing that a black did serve on the particular grand jury, or that a token number of blacks
                            had served on other grand juries, is not necessarily sufficient to rebut a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Color Coding Based on Race. - Where the evidence disclosed that the names of blacks were printed in red and the names of whites were printed in black in preparing names for the jury box, and that in drawing the names from the box the names of blacks were
                            without exception rejected, the motion of defendant, who was black, to quash the indictment found by a grand jury so selected should have been allowed, since such systematic and arbitrary exclusion of blacks from the grand
                            jury deprived him of his constitutional rights. State v. Speller, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 67</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 537 (1948).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Evidence held sufficient to support a finding that there was no racial discrimination in the selection of the grand jury. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 119</cite>, 108 S.E.2d 447, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 833,
                            80 S. Ct. 83, 4 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1959).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Record held to contain abundant evidence to support the finding by the trial judge that, in the selection of the grand jury which indicted defendants, there was no arbitrary or systematic exclusion of blacks. State v. Yoes,
                            <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).

                        <p>
                            Where defendant's evidence related to the racial composition of only one grand jury and one list of petit jurors, it did not show a course of conduct over a period of time resulting in an apparent systematic exclusion of blacks from the grand juries or
                            list of petit jurors, and thus failed to establish a prima facie case of systematic exclusion of blacks from either the grand jury which indicted defendant or the petit jury which convicted him. State v. Newkirk,
                            <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 187 S.E.2d 394, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 316</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 900 (1972).

                            Juror's Failure to Disclose Information. - Defendant was not denied his rights to confrontation, to effective assistance of counsel, to due process, to a jury trial, and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment when the trial court denied defendant's
                            motion for a mistrial based on the alleged misconduct of a juror; the juror inadvertent failure to disclose the 40-year-old information she had forgotten did not amount to concealment, and the juror demonstrated no bias. State

                            Impartiality of Jury Not Compromised by Juror Who Had "Crossed Paths" With Witness. - Defendant's right to due process was not violated where a juror failed to indicate during jury selection that he knew a witness as the two had merely "crossed paths
                            before" and thus, there was no possibility that a personal connection to the case compromised the juror's ability to be fair and just. State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 31,

                            Presence of Magistrate on Jury. - Defendant's constitutional right to an impartial jury was violated as a magistrate served on defendant's jury while having personal knowledge of defendant's prior drug charges and after having direct pretrial involvement
                            with the charges for which the magistrate participated in deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. State v. Neal, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 100, 674 S.E.2d 713 (2009).

                            To establish a prima facie case of systematic racial exclusion, defendants are generally required to produce not only statistical evidence establishing that blacks were underrepresented on the jury, but also evidence that the selection procedure itself
                            was not racially neutral, or that for a substantial period in the past relatively few blacks have served on the juries of the county notwithstanding a substantial black population therein, or both. State v. Foddrell,

                            Mere statement in defendant's brief that the systematic maneuverings of the prosecutor excluded people of defendant's race from the jury, unsupported by the record, failed to show that members of defendant's race were systematically or arbitrarily excluded
                            from the jury panel. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).

                            Defendant's mere showing that all blacks were challenged by the prosecuting attorney was not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of an arbitrary and systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury. State v. Noell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 670</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 750 (1974), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 902, 96 S. Ct. 3203, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1205 (1976).

                        <p>
                            For case in which defendant failed to make out a prima facie case of arbitrary or systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury, see also State v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 366</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 585 (1973).

                            Defendant found guilty of murder and robbery failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination, or a violation of this section, in the State's use of its peremptory challenges where the State's questions during voir dire focused on the prospective
                            juror's feelings about capital punishment and the age of the juror, or his or her children, as compared with defendant's age; the venire persons were brought into the courtroom individually, so neither defendant nor the State
                            knew how many black citizens were present in the venire or whether a black citizen would be examined next, and three of the first four jurors seated were black, both defendant and the victim were black, thus diminishing the
                            likelihood that racial issues were inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 607</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 418 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 905,

                            Trial court did nor err in denying defendant's Batson challenge to the State's exercising of a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective African-American juror because the State's race neutral explanations for using a peremptory challenge to remove
                            a prospective African-American juror - that her responses on death penalty were weak, that she admitted she might develop sympathy toward defendant, and that she made a misrepresentation on her questionnaire - complied with
                            Batson. State v. Alvarez, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 487, 608 S.E.2d 371 (2005).

                            When Exclusion of Class of Persons from Jury Service Will Not Invalidate Indictment. - Even the complete exclusion, by State law, of a group or class of persons from eligibility for jury service will not make invalid an indictment by a grand jury, selected
                            in accordance with such State law, so long as there is no reasonable basis for the conclusion that the ineligible group or class would bring to the deliberations of the jury a point of view not otherwise represented upon it,
                            at least where the defendant is not a member of the excluded group. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).

                            Exclusion of Age Group from Jury List. - The absence from the jury list of the names of persons between the ages of 18 and 21 during the period from July, 1971, the effective date of the amendment of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.009.html#t09a01s9-3" target="_blank">G.S. 9-3</a></cite>                            lowering the age requirement for jurors from 21 years to 18 years, and September, 1971, the date of defendants' trial, was not unreasonable and did not constitute systematic exclusion of this age group from jury service. State
                            v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).

                            Exemption from Jury Duty. - So far as the requirements of the due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV are concerned, it is sufficient, in order to sustain a State statutory exemption from jury duty, that there is reasonable ground for the legislature
                            to believe that the public interest and general welfare will be better served by the grant of the exemption than by subjecting the members of the exempted class to the duty imposed upon other members of the community. And it
                            is so held with reference to the provisions of this section. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).

                            <span class="s1">
    §

                            member of that race by such grand jury, irrespective of the fact that all members of the grand jury were, themselves, qualified jurors. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).

                            Exclusion Due to Bias Against Death Penalty. - Where prospective juror in a first-degree murder prosecution initially responded to both the prosecutor and the court that she did not have any moral or religious convictions against, and could vote for,
                            the death penalty, but she subsequently responded, upon further questioning by the prosecutor, that she would vote against the death penalty without regard to the evidence and notwithstanding the facts or circumstances, and
                            upon further questioning by the court, she was unable to affirmatively agree to follow the law and recommend a sentence based on the evidence and the law and that she would be trying to find ways she could vote against the
                            death penalty and would be predisposed or biased in some respect, the trial court did not err in excusing prospective juror for cause. State v. Jennings, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 579</cite>,

                            Selection of Grand Jury Foreman by Racially Neutral Standard. - A method of selecting a grand jury foreman that meets the racially neutral standard must ensure that all grand jurors are considered by the presiding judge for his selection and that his
                            selection be made on a racially neutral basis. State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 452</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 834 (1989).

                            Prima Facie Case of Racial Discrimination in Selection of Grand Jury Foreman. - A black defendant may make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the grand jury foreman's selection by showing either (1) that the selection procedure itself
                            was not racially neutral, or (2) that for a substantial period in the past, relatively few blacks have served in the position of foreman even though a substantial number have been selected to serve as members of grand juries;
                            the State may rebut such a prima facie case on remand by offering evidence that the process used in selecting the grand jury foreman was in fact racially neutral. State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 297</cite>,

                            Exclusion from Grand Jury on Grounds of Race - Denial of Due Process. - Arbitrary exclusion of citizens from service on grand juries on account of race is a denial of due process to members of the excluded race charged with indictable offenses. State

                            discrimination against the class or sex to which defendant belonged, and therefore that he could not raise the question of the qualification of women to serve as jurors or maintain that the proceeding constituted a violation

                            Section Prohibits Double Jeopardy. - Under this section, a person cannot be tried twice for the same offense. State v. Mansfield, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 233</cite>, 176 S.E. 761 (1934); State v. Crocker, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 446</cite>,

                            Former jeopardy, being based on the fundamental legal principle that a person cannot be tried twice for the same offense, is a good plea. State v. Partlow, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 60</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 688 (1967).

                            Part of the Law of the Land. - It is a fundamental and sacred principle of the common law, deeply imbedded in criminal jurisprudence, that no person can be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same offense. While the principle is not stated in
                            express terms in the North Carolina Constitution, it is regarded as an integral part of the "law of the land" within the meaning of this section. State v. Crocker, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 446</cite>,

                            The sacred principle of the common law that no person can twice be put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same offense has always been an integral part of the law of North Carolina; therefore, the decision in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S. Ct.
                            2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969), which made the double jeopardy provision of U.S. Const., Amend. V applicable to the several states through U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, added nothing to the law of this State. State v. Battle,

                            Guaranteed by Both State and Federal Constitutions. - It is a fundamental principle of the common law, now guaranteed by the federal and State constitutions, that no person can be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same offense. State v. Cutshall,

                            The common-law principle that no person can be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same offense is now guaranteed by both the federal and State Constitutions.

                            The constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy applies only to criminal cases. State v. Carlisle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 201 S.E.2d 704 (1973), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 229</cite>,

                            Double Trials and Double Punishment Prohibited. - A defendant is placed in double jeopardy when he is tried twice or punished twice for the same crime. State v. Carlisle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 201 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            The constitutional principle of double jeopardy is designed to protect an accused from double punishment as well as double trials for the same offense. State v. Irick, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 480</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 833
                            (1977); State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C.

                            Where multiple punishment is involved, the double jeopardy clause acts as a restraint on the prosecutor and the courts, not the legislature. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 444</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 701 (1986).

                            Courts May Not Impose More Punishment Than Intended by Legislature. - The double jeopardy clauses of both the United States and North Carolina Constitutions prohibit a court from imposing more punishment than that intended by the legislature. State v.
                            Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 444</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 701 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Legislature May Authorize Cumulative Punishment. - Where the legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, regardless of whether those who statutes proscribe the "same" conduct, a court's task of statutory construction
                            is at an end, and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 444</cite>,
                            340 S.E.2d 701 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Intent of Legislature Determines Punishment. - When a defendant is tried in a single trial for violations of two statutes that punish the same conduct, the amount of punishment allowable under the double jeopardy clause of the federal Constitution and
                            the law of the land clause of our State Constitution is determined by the intent of the legislature. State v. Freeland, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 13</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 35 (1986).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Double jeopardy does not prohibit multiple punishments for the same offenses, where both are tried at the same time, and the Legislature clearly intended them to be punished separately. State v. Strohauer, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite>                            68, 351 S.E.2d 823 (1987).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The general rule is that the defense of double jeopardy is not jurisdictional. State v. McKenzie, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 170</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 424 (1977); State v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite>                            656, 270 S.E.2d 120 (1980).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Double jeopardy is a personal defense. State v. Hopkins, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 473</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 657 (1971); State v. McKenzie, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 170</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 424 (1977).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The burden is upon defendant to sustain his plea of double jeopardy. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Generally the defense of double jeopardy is raised by a special plea upon which the defendant carries the burden. State v. McKenzie, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 170</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 424 (1977).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Abandonment of Plea of Double Jeopardy. - Where the defendant fails to plea double jeopardy and to offer supporting evidence thereon, he is deemed to have abandoned such plea. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>,
                            180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Dismissal on Jurisdiction Only. - Where the dismissal, upon defendant's motion, was based solely upon the trial court's ruling that it had no jurisdiction and was entirely unrelated to the sufficiency of evidence as to any element of the offense or to
                            defendant's guilt or innocence, and since there was no acquittal or conviction, a retrial would not offend the constitutional protections afforded by the prohibitions against double jeopardy. State v. Priddy,
                            <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 445 S.E.2d 610, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 805</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 751 (1994).

                            State's Recidivist Statutes Survive Double Jeopardy Challenges. - Recidivist statutes, or repeat-offender statutes, survived double jeopardy challenges because they increased the severity of the punishment for the crime being prosecuted, and they did
                            not punish a previous crime a second time; the Apprendi and Blakely holdings did not extend to the habitual misdemeanor assault statute, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-33.2" target="_blank">G.S. 14-33.2</a></cite>.

                            When Jeopardy Attaches. - Jeopardy attaches when a defendant in a criminal prosecution is placed on trial: (1) on a valid indictment or information, (2) before a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) after arraignment, (4) after plea, and (5) when a competent
                            jury has been empaneled and sworn. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971); State v. Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 479</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 372

                        <p>
                            It is clearly established in this State that jeopardy cannot attach until a jury has been sworn and empaneled. State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 210 S.E.2d 555 (1974), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>,

                            In a nonjury criminal trial, jeopardy attaches when the court begins to hear evidence or testimony. State v. Brunson, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 244</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 860 (1990).

                            Double Jeopardy Violation After Dismissal. - Because the State dismissed the charge against defendant after the first trial ended in a hung jury mistrial, defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was violated when he was retried six years later
                            and therefore the appellate court properly held that the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss. State v. Courtney, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 458</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 260 (2019),
                            cert. denied, 207 L. Ed. 2d. 151, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 2948 (U.S. 2020).

                        <p>
                            Three Situations of Double Jeopardy Identified. - There are essentially three contexts in which the North Carolina Supreme Court has held that conviction and punishment of a defendant for more than one offense results in impermissible multiple punishment:
                            (1) where a defendant is convicted and sentenced for both felony murder and the underlying felony; (2) where a defendant is convicted and sentenced for two offenses, one being a lesser included offense of the other; and (3)
                            where a defendant is convicted and sentenced for two offenses each arising out of the same conduct, but to which the legislature has affixed two criminal labels, and prosecutorial abuse is evident. State v. Martin,
                            <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 267 S.E.2d 35, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 238</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Continuing Offense Precludes Several Violations. - Defendant's conviction of two counts of keeping and maintaining a dwelling for the use of a controlled substance, where no evidence indicated a termination and subsequent resumption of drug trafficking,
                            was erroneous and constituted double jeopardy. State v. Grady, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 524 S.E.2d 75 (2000).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A plea of former jeopardy must be grounded on the same offense, both in law and fact. State v. Partlow, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 60</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 688 (1967).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To support the plea of double jeopardy, it is of no consequence that the earlier prosecution grew out of the same transaction. It must have been the same offense both in fact and in law. State v. Wiggins, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite>                            441, 204 S.E.2d 692, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 595</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 866 (1974); State v. Partin, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C.

                        <p>
                            Evidence Must Be Identical. - Double jeopardy does not occur when the evidence to support two or more offenses overlaps, but only when the evidence presented on more than one charge is identical. State v. Revelle, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 153</cite>,
                            270 S.E.2d 476 (1980).

                        <p>
                            Although defendant's husband did not fully penetrate 11-year-old victim until his third attempt, each separate act of intercourse was complete and sufficient to sustain an indictment for first degree rape, and no double jeopardy occurred when defendant/wife
                            was convicted as an aider and abettor for two counts of attempted rape and one count of rape. State v. Owen, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 516 S.E.2d 159, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 117</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Defendant's convictions for malicious conduct by a prisoner and habitual misdemeanor assault did not charge the same offense, and did not violate the double jeopardy clause; although the conduct alleged in both indictments was identical, the evidence
                            needed to prove both malicious conduct by a prisoner and habitual misdemeanor assault based on an assault of a government employee was different, which meant separate offenses were involved. State v. Artis,

                            Prosecution of a Substantive Criminal Offense Following an Adjudication of Criminal Contempt. - Where the prohibition in a protective order met the legal elements necessary for assault on a female under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-33ol1b2" target="_blank">G.S. 14-33(b)(2)</a></cite>,
                            the defendant's prosecution on this charge, subsequent to his being held in contempt for violating the protective order, was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause and his conviction for assault on a female was vacated. State

                            Test for Double Jeopardy. - The double jeopardy test is whether the facts alleged in the second indictment, if given in evidence, would have sustained a conviction under the first indictment, or whether the same evidence would support a conviction in
                            each case. State v. Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 479</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 372 (1972); State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 267 S.E.2d 35, appeal dismissed and

                        <p>
                            The test of former jeopardy is not whether respondent has been tried for the same act, but whether he has been put in jeopardy for the same offense. The offenses must be the same both in fact and in law. In re Drakeford,

                        <p>
                            The applicable double jeopardy test in an assault case is the "same evidence test," which asks two questions: First, whether the facts alleged in the second indictment, if given in evidence, would have sustained a conviction under the first indictment,
                            the answer to which question is determined by an examination of the two indictments, and second, whether the same evidence would support a conviction in each case, which question looks at facts dehors the indictments. State

                            "Additional Facts" Test Explained. - The additional facts test of double jeopardy is as follows: A single act may be an offense against two statutes, and if each statute requires proof of an additional fact, which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction
                            under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the other. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 248 S.E.2d 65 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a single act constitutes an offense against two statutes and each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, the offenses are not the same in law and in fact and a defendant may be convicted and punished for both. State

                            Application of Additional Facts Test. - The additional facts test is bilateral in its application. The two offenses may have one or more circumstances in common, but in order to constitute either of the offenses sufficiently for prosecution, some additional
                            circumstance must be added. It is the added circumstance which makes each a separate and distinct offense. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 248 S.E.2d 65 (1978).

                            and sucking a victim's breasts, performing oral sex on the victim, and committing sexual intercourse with the victim did not violate the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution and N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 19, as there were two distinct sexual acts and touch in the single encounter; the indictments each spelled out a separate and distinct fact needed to be proven by the State in order to gain a conviction, and the
                            three acts were distinct acts each constituting the crime of indecent liberties. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 698, 643 S.E.2d 34 (2007).

                            "Lesser Degree" Rule. - In determining whether jeopardy has attached, it is necessary to apply tests firmly established by the courts. The "lesser degree" rule states that where the second indictment is for a crime greater in degree than the first, and
                            where both indictments arise out of the same act, an acquittal or conviction for the first is a bar to a prosecution for the second. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 322,

                            Fact that concurrent, identical sentences are imposed in each case makes duplication of conviction and punishment no less a violation of defendant's constitutional right not to be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense. State v. Martin,

                            Defendant's contention that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms in prison for defendant's two convictions of first-degree sexual offense violated double jeopardy, was not preserved for appellate review because it was not
                            presented to the trial court; in any event, defendant's contention had to be rejected because the sentences were based on separate and distinct acts and did not constitute multiple punishments for a single offense. State v.

                            Waiver May Be Implied. - A waiver of the constitutional right not to be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense is usually implied from the action or inaction of a defendant when brought to trial in a subsequent proceeding. State v. Hopkins,

                            Trial court did not err by denying defendant's request for appropriate relief on double jeopardy grounds given that he waived the right to assert the claim by entering pleas of guilty; because <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1415ol1b3" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1415(b)(3)</a></cite>                            authorized a convicted criminal defendant to seek relief if the conviction was obtained in violation of the United States or North Carolina Constitution, the trial court did have jurisdiction to consider the validity of that

                            Plea of Former Jeopardy Deemed Waived When New Trial Awarded. - When, in either a post-conviction hearing or a habeas corpus proceeding, at the prisoner's request, the court vacates a judgment against him and directs a new trial, the prisoner waives his
                            constitutional protection against double jeopardy, and he may be tried anew on the same indictment for the same offense. In such case, a plea of former jeopardy will avail him nothing. State v. Case,

                            Only where the accused himself brings about destruction of the first verdict that he can be retried for the same offense. Where the defendant seasonably abandoned his attempt to destroy the verdict which pronounced him guilty of murder in the second degree,
                            a new trial could not lawfully be forced upon him after such abandonment. State v. Case, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 330</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 509 (1966).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An accused will be protected from subsequent prosecution for the same offense where a valid judgment is set aside by the court on its own motion or upon application of the prosecuting attorney, unless of course the accused acquiesces in the action. State
                            v. Case, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 330</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 509 (1966).

                            If a conviction is reversed for insufficiency of the evidence, double jeopardy precludes remanding the case for a new trial even if the State has evidence which it could offer at a new trial but did not offer at the trial from which the appeal was taken;
                            however, there is no such impediment in ordering a new trial when the first trial was tainted by mere "trial error." State v. Silhan, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 223</cite>, 275 S.E.2d 450 (1981),

                            Both federal decisions, applying U.S. Const., Amend. V, and State decisions, applying common law and State constitutional principles, have recognized that, in certain situations arising in criminal prosecutions, the court may order a mistrial before verdict
                            and again place defendant on trial without violating the double jeopardy prohibition. State v. Preston, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 175 S.E.2d 705 (1971).

                            An order of mistrial in a criminal case, entered when the jurors declare their inability to agree, must be left to the trial judge, in the exercise of his judicial discretion, and will not support a plea of former jeopardy. State v. Battle,

                            Double jeopardy clause of North Carolina Constitution, N.C. Const., Art. I, G.S. 19, did not bar prosecution of criminal defendant on felony child abuse charges after her first trial ended in a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict as dismissal
                            of those charges pursuant to her motion for appropriate relief was improper since the two statutes cited in that motion, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1227" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1227</a></cite>                            and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1414" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1414</a></cite>, did not authorize the trial court to grant relief under the facts, and thus, required the motion for

                            Test for determining under our state constitution whether a case may be retried after the court grants a defendant's motion for a mistrial is as follows: If a defendant moves for a mistrial, he or she normally should be held to have waived the right not
                            to be tried a second time for the same offense. Where the defendant makes such a motion because of prosecutorial misconduct, and the court grants the motion, retrial is not barred by this section unless the defendant shows
                            that the prosecutor was motivated by the intent to provoke a mistrial instead of merely the intent to prejudice the defendant. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 506</cite>, 369 S.E.2d
                            813 (1988).

                            Where It Is Ordered for Physical Necessity or Necessity of Doing Justice. - Even where all the elements of jeopardy appear, a plea of former jeopardy will not prevail where an order of mistrial was properly entered for "physical necessity or the necessity
                            of doing justice." State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A subsequent trial of a defendant, following termination of earlier proceedings upon an order of mistrial, is not precluded by a plea of former jeopardy where the mistrial was granted, over defendant's objections, due to "a physical necessity or the necessity
                            of doing justice." State v. Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 34</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 226 (1977).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Physical necessity" is illustrated where a juror by a sudden attack of illness is wholly disqualified from proceeding with the trial, or where the prisoner becomes insane during the trial, or where a female defendant is taken in labor during the trial.
                            State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).

                        <p>
                            "Necessity of doing justice" is not an expression connoting a vague generality, but one that relates to a limited subject, namely, the occurrence of some incident of a nature that would render impossible a fair and impartial trial under the law. State
                            v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Necessity of doing justice" arises from the duty of the court to guard the administration of justice from fraudulent practices; as in the case of tampering with the jury, or keeping back the witnesses on the part of the prosecution. State v. Cutshall,
                            <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The test of "necessity of doing justice" does not exist solely for the benefit of a defendant. It is fundamental in our system of jurisprudence that each party to an action is entitled to a fair and impartial trial. State v. Shuler,
                            <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 34</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 226 (1977).

                        <p>
                            No Limit to Number of Mistrials. - There is no specific limit to the number of times a defendant may be retried after a mistrial has been properly declared. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 439</cite>, 279 S.E.2d
                            542 (1981).

                        <p>
                            The decision to grant a mistrial is a decision will within the trial judge's discretion when faced with the occurrence of some incident of a nature that would render impossible a fair and impartial trial under the law. State v. Shuler,
                            <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 34</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 226 (1977).

                            Under North Carolina law, with the concurrence of the defendant, a judge may declare a mistrial at any time during the trial; where, after the trial started, the trial court judge discovered that he was familiar with certain aspects of the case, and where
                            defendant did not object to the trial court's order of a mistrial, the mistrial was appropriate, and double jeopardy did not prevent later prosecution. State v. Cummings, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite>                            249, 609 S.E.2d 423 (2005).

                            Duty of Judge Ordering Mistrial in Capital Cases. - In all cases, capital included, the court may discharge a jury and order a mistrial when it is necessary to attain the ends of justice. It is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial judge,
                            but in capital cases he is required to find the facts fully and place them upon the record, so that upon a plea of former jeopardy, the action of the court may be reviewed. State v. Cutshall,
                            <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).

                        <p>
                            In capital cases the trial court must make findings of fact upon granting a mistrial and place them in the record, so that the court's action may be reviewed on appeal. State v. Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 34</cite>,
                            235 S.E.2d 226 (1977).

                        <p>
                            Double Jeopardy Shown in Capital Case. - Where the initial declaration of a mistrial during the defendant's first trial on the capital charge against her was not the result of manifest necessity, and therefore was error, and it could not be determined
                            from the record whether the error in initially declaring a mistrial caused the jury to fail to reach agreement after the court had reinstated the jury, and thus deprived the defendant of a verdict, the trial court erred when
                            it later denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of murder in the first degree against her for the reason that she had formerly been placed in jeopardy for the same offense. State v. Lachat,
                            <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 73</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 872 (1986).

                            Double Jeopardy Not Shown in Capital Case. - Imposition of death penalty in the defendant's second trial did not violate double jeopardy or Ring because the jury in the first trial had found at least one statutory aggravator and the jury in the second
                            trial had also found at least one statutory aggravator. State v. Duke, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 110</cite>, 623 S.E.2d 11 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Defendant's failure to object to termination of her first trial for capital murder by a declaration of mistrial would not prevent her from receiving the relief to which she was otherwise entitled on grounds of former jeopardy, on appeal of her conviction
                            at a second trial. State v. Lachat, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 73</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 872 (1986).

                            Conviction Under Federal Statute With Sanctions Under State Statute Held Not Double Jeopardy. - A conviction under a federal statute followed by disciplinary sanctions pursuant to a State statute for the same conduct does not violate the double jeopardy
                            clause. In re Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 466, 402 S.E.2d 475, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 269</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 832 (1991).

                            Parole Revocation Did Not Result in Additional Punishment Within the Meaning of Double Jeopardy. - Double jeopardy prohibition did not bar a prosecution for failure to comply with sex offender registration, despite the fact that the grounds for this prosecution
                            were the same as used to revoke defendant's parole from a sentence imposed in a separate case. State v. Sparks, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 45, 641 S.E.2d 339 (2007), aff'd,

                            Prosecutorial Misconduct Intended to Provoke Motion for Mistrial. - Where the former trial is terminated by a mistrial granted at the request of, or with the consent of, the defendant, the general rule is that the double jeopardy clause does not bar retrial,
                            even if the defendant's motion for mistrial is made as a result of prosecutorial error; however, where the prosecutorial misconduct giving rise to the defendant's motion for mistrial is intended to goad or provoke the defendant
                            into moving for a mistrial, the defendant may invoke the protection of the double jeopardy clause to bar a retrial. State v. Major, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 352 S.E.2d 862 (1987).

                            Double Jeopardy Not Shown. - Where each defendant was separately arraigned and pleaded to the bill of indictment, following which the cases were continued to the next term of court, defendants were not twice put in jeopardy by a second arraignment when
                            the cases were called for trial the following term. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 229</cite>, 183 S.E. 286 (1936).

                            present due to his physical condition. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 35</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 313 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).

                            that the State's case was going so badly and the prejudice resulting from the prosecutor's conduct was so grave that the defendant's choice to continue or to abort the proceedings was rendered unmeaningful. State v. White,

         Proceeding with Absent Witnesses.
        </b> - Without any evidence that the defendant instigated the State's witnesses' absence, no manifest necessity existed for mistrial purposes and the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss; the State's
                            explanation to the judge about not knowing where the witnesses were illustrated that the State knew the witnesses were not present, yet the State proceeded to impanel the jury anyway, thereby assuming the risk of defendant's

                            was no double jeopardy infirmity inherent in the Habitual Felon Act as applied in conjunction with the North Carolina Structured Sentencing Act; and (3) the state appellate court and the state supreme court have rejected constitutional

                            the North Carolina and federal constitutions to impose three separate sentences for three counts of attempted discharge of a firearm into occupied property or to sentence defendant both for the three attempt counts and for

                            Testimony that three gun shots were fired in quick succession, each hitting a different location around the front door, and that neither of the guns potentially used were fully automatic tended to show that each of the three shots for which the second
                            defendant was convicted was a distinct time; therefore, second defendant's three convictions did not violate the rule against double jeopardy. State v.

                            Crimes Against Minor Not Violative of Double Jeopardy. - Defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was not violated because none of the elements for indecent liberties with a child and using a minor in obscenity were the same; therefore, defendant
                            did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to raise the double jeopardy argument. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 43, 671 S.E.2d 53 (2009).

                            a verdict with regard to first degree murder, and the jury was erroneously advised that it must unanimously agree to acquittal of first degree murder before consideration of the lesser offense, a retrial of defendant for first
                            degree murder did not constitute double jeopardy since there was never a final verdict in the first trial. State v. Mays, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 582 S.E.2d 360 (2003), cert.

                            Each Seized Item of Obscene Material a Separate Offense. - The trial court did not err by refusing to arrest judgment on defendant's two counts of disseminating obscenity, even though the films sold police were sold in the same transaction, since it was
                            the clear intent of the legislature to treat the dissemination of each seized item of obscene material as a separate offense. State v. Von Wilds, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 362

                            Final verdict is required before there can be an implied acquittal. Jury votes on included offenses may be the result of a temporary compromise in an effort to reach unanimity. A jury should not be precluded from reconsidering a previous vote on any issue,
                            and the weight of final adjudication should not be given to any jury action that is not returned in a final verdict. State v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 302</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 78 (1982).

                            Revocation of Driver's License Cannot Constitute Double Jeopardy. - Since the revocation of a driver's license is not a form of criminal punishment, it cannot constitute double jeopardy. State v. Carlisle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite>                            358, 201 S.E.2d 704 (1973), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 229</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 15 (1974).

                            criminal conviction for DWI did not violate the double jeopardy clause. State v. Oliver, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 202</cite>, 470 S.E.2d 16 (1996).

                            Order Denying Motion Immediately Appealable. - A defendant's right not to be unconstitutionally subjected to multiple criminal trials for the same offense is a substantial right, a violation of which cannot be fully remedied by an appeal taken after the
                            subsequent trial has already occurred because the mere fact of the subsequent trial is a violation of the protected right; therefore, where a motion for dismissal of criminal charges is based upon double jeopardy grounds, an
                            order denying the motion is immediately appealable. State v. Major, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 352 S.E.2d 862 (1987).

                            victim, because defendant could not have been prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel when a double jeopardy argument would have been unsuccessful at trial, as neither of the offenses was a lesser included offense of

                            No Double Jeopardy in Conviction for Armed Robbery and Kidnapping. - Double jeopardy did not result when defendant was tried and convicted of kidnapping for the purpose of facilitating flight following his participation in an armed robbery and of armed
                            robbery, since the intent of the legislature in establishing the punishment for kidnapping was to impose an indivisible penalty for restraint and removal for specified purposes, no hypothetical part of which penalty represents
                            a punishment for the felony which gave rise to the flight of defendant and his removal of the victim, and since the crimes of armed robbery and kidnapping involve vastly different social implications, and the legislature is
                            clearly free to denounce each as a separately punishable offense. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 267 S.E.2d 35, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 238</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Fact that defendant was sentenced on both a first-degree kidnapping conviction and a robbery with a dangerous weapon conviction did not violate his double jeopardy rights, as proof of the kidnapping did not require proof of the commission of the robbery
                            itself; further, as the jury had concluded that there was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty of the separate offenses, the trial court was bound by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIIa81Bs15A-1340.17" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1340.17</a></cite>                            to sentence defendant on each conviction.

                            of defendant for kidnapping, in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa10s14-39ol1a2" target="_blank">G.S. 14-39(a)(2)</a></cite>, was proper and not violative

                            crimes, none of which is a lesser included offense of another. State v. Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 34</cite>, 352 S.E.2d 673 (1987).

                            The crime against nature, taking indecent liberties with a child, and sexual offense in the second degree are legally separate and distinct crimes, and convictions for all three crimes arising out of the same transaction did not place the defendant in
                            double jeopardy. State v. Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 34</cite>, 352 S.E.2d 673 (1987).

                            Trial court did not err in imposing judgments of conviction upon defendant for both assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill while inflicting serious injury and discharging a weapon into occupied property; entry of those judgments of conviction
                            did not violate defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy, because the same evidence was not used to prove both offenses. State v. Allah, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 607

                            There was no risk of a lack of unanimity where defendant was charged with and convicted of the same number of offenses, and the evidence supported that number of offenses; using the same underlying act to support convictions for both first-degree sexual
                            offense and indecent liberties did not violate defendant's constitutional protection against double jeopardy. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 615 S.E.2d 360 (2005),

                            Burglary and Murder Convictions Not Double Jeopardy. - Trial court did not err by permitting State to try defendant for both burglary and first degree murder of victim; although the intended felony for the burglary was murder of the victim; since at least
                            one essential element of each crime was not an element of the other, there was no merit in defendant's contentions that he was subjected to double jeopardy. State v. Parks, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 94</cite>,

                            Defendant's burglary conviction did not violate double jeopardy principles where he was also convicted for first degree felony-murder. There was no inconsistency in the jury finding a lack of premeditation and deliberation required for first degree murder
                            but finding the requisite intent to murder to satisfy a burglary conviction. State v. Blyther, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 531 S.E.2d 855 (2000).

                            Different Victims Meant No Double Jeopardy Violation. - Prosecution on two counts of discharging a firearm into occupied property did not violate federal and State prohibitions against double jeopardy even though 3606 and 3608 Jonquil Street were apartments
                            located within the same building; the facts alleged in the second count of the indictment - that the building was located at 3608 Jonquil Street and was occupied by one set of victims, would not have sustained defendant's conviction
                            for shooting into 3606 Jonquil while that residence was occupied by another set of victims. State v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 621, 389 S.E.2d 422 (1990).

                            Murder and Conspiracy Convictions Not Violation of Double Jeopardy. - Defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit murder did not merge into her conviction for murder by acting in concert because the requirement of an agreement, while necessary to
                            sustain a conviction for conspiracy, was not a necessary element for murder by acting in concert. State v. Kemmerlin, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 446</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 870 (2002).

                            Defendant's constitutional double jeopardy protection was not violated where defendant was convicted of first-degree kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, and maiming without malice because the offenses
                            contained distinct elements not found in the others. State v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 587 S.E.2d 485 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 158</cite>,

                            Murder and Assault Convictions Not Double Jeopardy. - Trial court did not err by submitting to the jury both attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, and by imposing consecutive sentences for the offenses,
                            because each offense contained at least one element not included in the other; therefore, defendants were not been subjected to double jeopardy. State v. Tirado, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 551</cite>,

                            on the victim. State v. Tirado, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 551</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 515 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 909, 125 S. Ct. 1600, 161 L. Ed. 2d 285 (2005).

                            Sexual Assaults Conviction Not Violative of Double Jeopardy. - Indictments posed no danger to defendant's rights under the double jeopardy clause because, while he was tried for acts of sexual assault that occurred in one county, he was not tried for
                            any acts he may have committed in another county. State v. Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 631 S.E.2d 868 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 222</cite>,

                            Attempted Murder and Assault Not Violative of Double Jeopardy. - Even though the offenses arose out of a single course of conduct, defendant was properly charged and convicted of two separate and distinct offenses of attempted murder and assault as to
                            each victim and there was no double jeopardy violation. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 640, 711 S.E.2d 797 (2011).

                            Evidence presented in support of a 2010 indictment for felony stalking amounted to double jeopardy because the indictment was the same in law as a 2009 indictment, in that the time periods of the "course of conduct" for both indictments overlapped and
                            thus the same acts could have resulted in a conviction under either indictment. State v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 721 S.E.2d 673 (2011).

                            (1) defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon with the intent to kill and inflicting serious injury, which provided a greater punishment, and (2) <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sXIa52s14-392ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 14-3.2(a)</a></cite>                            barred an AISBI conviction if defendant was also convicted of another offense, based on the same conduct, that provided a greater punishment.

                            Where the original indictment charging defendant with attempted first-degree murder was constitutionally and statutorily sufficient to provide jurisdiction, allege attempted voluntary manslaughter, and was not fatally defective, no manifest necessity
                            existed to declare a mistrial over defendant's objections, the State was barred from re-indicting defendant on attempted murder or manslaughter and the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the subsequent
                            indictment. Therefore, defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated by his subsequent indictment, prosecution, trial, and conviction of attempted first-degree murder. State v. Schalow,

                            Double Jeopardy Shown in Robbery and Kidnapping Convictions. - Since the State failed to show that the removal of the victims was separate from the robbery, that it increased the danger beyond that inherent in the robbery, that the victims were physically
                            injured, or that they were subjected to restraint beyond that of the threatened use of a firearm, defendant's kidnapping convictions were reversed as being in violation of double jeopardy. State v. Ripley,

                            Double Jeopardy Shown in Rape Convictions. - In a case in which the defendant and an accomplice raped a woman, defendant was entitled to a new trial on the charge of first degree rape by acting in concert with someone else because the jury instruction
                            referred to guilt both as a principle and by acting in concert, which allowed the jury to convict defendant twice for the same crime, in violation of double jeopardy rights. State v. Person,

                            In this State a defendant may not be punished both for felony murder and for the underlying "predicate" felony, even in a single prosecution. Whether in other situations multiple punishments may be imposed when a defendant, in a single trial, is convicted
                            of multiple offenses when some are fully, factually embraced within others is to be determined on the basis of legislative intent. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 444</cite>, 340

                            The offenses of attempted murder and felonious assault are not duplicitous and the charging of both is, therefore, not double jeopardy; assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, unlike attempted murder, requires proof of the use of a deadly weapon,
                            and malice is an element of attempted murder, but not of felonious assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill. State v. Washington, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 540 S.E.2d

                            Plea of Former Jeopardy Upheld. - Where judgment of nonsuit on the ground of variance was entered in a defendant's trial upon an indictment charging armed robbery of a store in which the life of a named employee was endangered and in which money belonging
                            to the store was taken from the named employee, and where defendant was subsequently prosecuted upon another armed robbery indictment for the same occurrence, which alleged that the lives of two other employees were endangered
                            and that the money was taken from the two other employees, and where the evidence in both trials showed that the robbery was perpetrated by endangering and threatening all employees then present in the store, including those
                            named in both indictments, but that the money was removed from the immediate presence of the two employees named in the second indictment, as the same evidence would have supported a conviction in both trials, defendant's plea
                            of former jeopardy prior to his second trial should have been allowed. State v. Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 479</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 372 (1972).

                            Where the affray charge upon which juvenile was convicted had as an essential element the assault charge which had been dismissed for lack of evidence, respondent's acquittal on the assault charge barred further petitions based on that charge. In re Drakeford,

                            Arrest of Judgment Required. - Although prosecution of defendants for assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm and for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy, nor require the
                            State to elect prosecution under a single statute, since each offense required proof of an element which did not exist in the other charge, arrest of judgment of their conviction of the lesser offense was required when they
                            were convicted of both crimes, since assault and the use of a deadly weapon were necessarily included in the offense of assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm, and defendants could not be punished twice for the
                            same offense. State v. Partin, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 274, 269 S.E.2d 250, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 404</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 449 (1980).

                            Where a defendant was convicted of assault with a firearm on a law enforcement officer and assault with a deadly weapon based on the same conduct, and because assault with a deadly weapon by way of a firearm is necessarily included in the offense of assault
                            with a firearm on a law enforcement officer, a judgment on both assault with a deadly weapon and assault with a firearm on a law enforcement officer could not stand; the assault with a deadly weapon charge should have been

                            Conviction of Breaking and Entering and Weapon Possession by Felon. - Defendant's prior conviction of felonious breaking and entering was not an "offense" within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause when construed with defendant's conviction of possession
                            of a firearm by a felon; defendant was not prosecuted nor punished again for the underlying conviction for felonious breaking and entering, but was convicted and punished for defendant's subsequent act of unlawfully possessing
                            a firearm as a convicted felon. State v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 647 S.E.2d 679, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 703</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 402 (2007).

                            the legislature did not intend to punish a defendant for possession of the same property twice. State v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 577 S.E.2d 683 (2003).

                            Convictions May Be Had for Breaking or Entering and Larceny. - The prohibitions in the United States and North Carolina Constitutions against placing a person twice in jeopardy do not prohibit, in a single trial, convictions and punishment for both breaking
                            or entering and felony larceny based upon that breaking or entering. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 444</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 701 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Conviction and punishment for both felony breaking or entering and felonious larceny based upon the same breaking or entering in a single trial is not prohibited by the provisions of either the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of
                            North Carolina. State v. Edmondson, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 187</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 110 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Because the crimes of larceny and obtaining property by false pretenses are separate and distinguishable offenses, the issuance of a second indictment for false pretenses, after the dismissal of larceny charges at the close of the State's evidence, did
                            not constitute double jeopardy. State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 461, 331 S.E.2d 227, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 187</cite>, 339 S.E.2d 409 (1985).

                            Robbery defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated because the fact that the bank's money was obtained from two tellers did not allow the State to indict defendant for two separate armed robberies. State v. Becton,

                            Multiple Driving Offense Conviction Violating Double Jeopardy. - Defendant's convictions for speeding, reckless driving, and speeding to elude arrest, aggravated to a felony for speeding and reckless driving, violated double jeopardy because (1) speeding
                            and reckless driving were elements of the third crime, since speeding and reckless driving increased the maximum penalty, and (2) the legislature intended to impose alternate, not separate, punishments, since all the statutes
                            sought to deter the same conduct. State v. Mulder, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 755 S.E.2d 98 (2014).

                            Right to Counsel Dependent on Potential Confinement. - The strict distinctions formerly drawn between criminal and civil actions are no longer valid, and due process presumptively requires the appointment of legal counsel to represent an indigent defendant
                            if his actual imprisonment, or comparable confinement, is a likely result in the proceeding at hand. Wake County ex rel. Carrington v. Townes, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 333</cite>, 293 S.E.2d

                            Conflict of Interest. - Because defendant did not waive her right to conflict free counsel, she argued that she claimed possession of the heroin and the paraphernalia to protect her boyfriend, and because he was represented by defense counsel's boss,
                            there was a potential for a conflict under N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(a); thus, a hearing should have been held. State v. Mims, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 637 S.E.2d 244 (2006).

                            1.7(a) because a former client was called as a witness against defendant; there was no conflict since: (1) counsel had represented the witness three years prior to defendant's trial and was no longer representing the witness;
                            (2) counsel had no recollection as to specifics of the witness's case aside from the fact that the witness had been convicted; (3) counsel's statement that counsel would review counsel's file to see if counsel had any information
                            to help defendant proved that counsel was committed to defendant's case; and (4) counsel made significant inroads to undermine the witness's credibility. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 651
                            S.E.2d 924 (2007).

                            The guarantee of counsel only applies to "critical stages" of the prosecution, and what constitutes a critical stage is determined both from the nature of the proceedings and from the facts in each case. State v. Hall,
                            <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 728, 252 S.E.2d 100 (1979).

                        <p>
                            A probable cause hearing is a "critical stage" of the criminal process entitling an indigent person to appointed counsel if he desires such assistance. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759

                            Administration of a gunshot residue test is not a critical stage of criminal proceedings to which the constitutional right to counsel attaches. Therefore, testimony that defendant refused to submit to the test until she talked to her attorney did not
                            violate her constitutional rights. State v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 163</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 352, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 587 (1981), rehearing denied,

                            Right to Counsel Includes Reasonable Time for Preparation. - The constitutional right to assistance of counsel necessarily includes that counsel should have a reasonable time to prepare for trial. However, no set length of time for investigation, preparation
                            and presentation is required, and whether defendant is denied due process must be determined upon the basis of the circumstances in each case. State v.

                            Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a continuance where the State, in defendant's attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon case, presented defendant with a statement on the morning of trial that it had obtained
                            from the man who had allegedly sold defendant the gun used in the shootings involved in defendant's case; defendant had not shown evidence that he would have been better prepared had the motion to continue been granted or that
                            he was materially prejudiced by the denial of his motion, and defendant was given a recess by the trial court to allow his counsel to interview the man. State v. Bethea, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite>                            43, 617 S.E.2d 687 (2005).

                            Mere Failure to Grant a Continuance Is Not a Denial of Effective Assistance. - Unless counsel suggests the existence of material witnesses or information that would possibly lead to material evidence or material witnesses, the mere failure to grant a
                            continuance in order for the defense to make an investigation would not, in and of itself, constitute a denial of effective assistance of counsel. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>,

                            Prevention of Adequate Preparation by Defendant. - The conduct of a defendant in failing either to retain counsel or to avail himself of his right, if any, to court appointed counsel, may make him solely responsible for any lack of trial preparation on
                            the part of his counsel. State v. McDiarmid, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 243 S.E.2d 398 (1978).

                            Decision Not to Introduce Evidence. - The trial court's deferral of its ruling, on whether introduction of certain evidence by defendant would open the door to permit the State to introduce irrelevant and prejudicial evidence about defendant's prior convictions,
                            did not improperly chill the defendant's rights to introduce evidence; his decision not to introduce the evidence was purely tactical and did not implicate any rights. State v. Holman, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 174</cite>,

                            Test of effective assistance of counsel is whether the assistance given was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. State v. Vickers, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 90</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 599

                            There are no set rules to determine whether a defendant has been deprived of effective assistance of counsel; rather, each case must be approached upon an ad hoc basis, viewing the circumstances as a whole in order to determine this question. State v.

                            Trial Judge Better Able to Evaluate Effectiveness. - The trial judge, who actually sees the lawyer's behavior, is better able than an appellate court to evaluate the overall effectiveness of representation. State v. Richards,

                            Physical Incapacity of Counsel. - The question of effective assistance of counsel involving the physical incapacity of counsel does not turn on the physical incapacity of counsel as such, since this may or may not deprive a defendant of effective representation.
                            Rather, it is necessary to examine counsel's specific acts or omissions which the defendant alleges constitute a denial of effective assistance. The reviewing court must approach such questions ad hoc and in each case must
                            view the circumstances as a whole. State v. Richards, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 474</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 844 (1978).

                            Notwithstanding defense attorney's hearing disability, his efforts and the assistance of co-counsel were held to have provided defendant with effective legal representation throughout criminal proceedings. State v. Richards,

                            Waiver. - Defendant was granted a new trial on his indictment for habitual felon status because, despite defendant's dissatisfaction with his prior counsel and clearly-stated desire to proceed pro se, the trial court erred by failing to conduct an inquiry
                            as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>. State v. Watlington, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite>                            388, 716 S.E.2d 671 (2011).

                            A defendant in a criminal proceeding, whether at trial or in pretrial proceedings, may waive his right to counsel if he does so freely and understandingly and with full knowledge of his right to be represented by counsel. State v. Cobb,

                            Defendant Did Not Forfeit Right. - Defendant did not forfeit his right to counsel, and the trial court deprived him of his right to counsel by denying his request to activate his standby counsel and therefore he was entitled to a new trial, because he
                            twice requested appointment of substitute standby counsel, the trial court instead attempted to complete the colloquy required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>,
                            defendant clearly and unequivocally stated that he wished to waive his right to represent himself rather than waive his right to counsel, and stated no fewer than five times that he did not wish to represent himself at trial.
                            State v. Harvin, - N.C. App. - , 836 S.E.2d 899 (2019), cert. granted, 840 S.E.2d 784, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 490 (N.C. 2020), cert. denied, 840 S.E.2d 785, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 489 (N.C. 2020).

                        <p>
                            Trial court may find that a criminal defendant has forfeited the right to counsel. In such a case, the court is not required to follow the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>,
                            which the court would otherwise be required to do before permitting a defendant to proceed pro se. A finding that a defendant has forfeited the right to counsel requires egregious dilatory or abusive conduct on the part of
                            the defendant which undermines the purposes of the right to counsel and prevents the trial court from complying with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Absent egregious conduct by the defendant, a defendant must be advised of the right to counsel, the consequences of proceeding without counsel, and the nature of the charges and proceedings and the range of permissible punishments before the defendant
                            can proceed without counsel. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>. Thus, where the defendant's behavior was not so
                            egregious as to prevent the court from proceeding, or to create a danger of any kind, forfeiture of the constitutional right to counsel has not occurred. State v. Simpkins, - N.C. - , 838 S.E.2d 439 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant had not engaged in such serious misconduct as to warrant forfeiture of the right to counsel where his untimely objection, questions, and speaking out of turn for 20 minutes at the start of the proceeding before he was required to proceed pro
                            se, while frustrating to the court, was not so egregious as to frustrate the purposes of the right to counsel. Moreover, nothing in the record suggested that he was rude or disrespectful to the trial court. State v. Simpkins,
                            - N.C. - , 838 S.E.2d 439 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in determining that defendant forfeited his constitutional right to counsel because forfeiture required egregious misconduct that obstructs or delays the proceedings, and nothing in the record indicated that defendant's difficulty cooperating
                            with his two court-appointed attorneys had delayed or obstructed the proceedings. State v. Patterson, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 21, 2020).

                        <p>
                            Indigent Defendant May Waive Counsel. - The purpose of the statutory provision for appointment of counsel at public expense for indigent defendants is to put indigent defendants on an equality with affluent defendants in trials upon criminal charges.
                            To deny or to restrict the right of the indigent to waive counsel and represent himself, while permitting the affluent defendant to exercise such right, would be beyond the power of the legislature, as such action would have
                            no reasonable relation to the objective of equal opportunity. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Indigency is obviously a sufficient basis for classification with reference to the right to court-appointed, publicly paid counsel, but it is not a reasonable basis for classification as to the right to represent one's self. State v. Mems,
                            <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).

                            For case upholding finding that defendant's counsel was not ineffective but if he was, the defendant did not show prejudice, see State v. Swann, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 666</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 533 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Defendant did not invoke his right to counsel; thus, the motion to suppress defendant's statement was properly denied. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 476 S.E.2d 453 (1996).

                        <p>
                            Right to Counsel Held Waived. - Even though counsel was appointed for defendant, he waived the right to have counsel when he initiated a conversation and volunteered statements to investigators without being questioned; neither his Fifth Amendment nor
                            his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and his statements were properly admitted at his trial. State v. Boggess, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 676</cite>, 600 S.E.2d 453 (2004).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant's constitutional rights to counsel were not violated because the trial court determined defendant elected to proceed pro se as defendant signed waiver of counsel forms and the court gave defendant years to find an attorney, advised and counseled
                            defendant about the right to an attorney including the right to appointed counsel, counseled defendant on the complexity of handling a jury trial, and addressed the seriousness of the charges and advised defendant a conviction
                            likely meant a life sentence. State v. Schumann, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 866, 810 S.E.2d 379 (2018), review denied, 811 S.E.2d 590, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 252 (2018).

                            Defendant forfeited defendant's right to court-appointed counsel because defendant's failure to hire defendant's own counsel over a period of years resulted in repeated delays in the case proceeding to trial. State v. Schumann,

                            Defendant Did Not Engage in Serious Misconduct so as to Warrant Forfeiture of Right to Counsel. - Trial court violated defendant's constitutional right to counsel by requiring him to represent himself where he neither voluntarily waived his right to be
                            represented by counsel nor engaged in such serious misconduct as to warrant forfeiture of his right to counsel without any warning that he would be required to represent himself or an inquiry under

                            uniformly polite and cooperative, he did not deny the trial court's jurisdiction, disrupt court proceedings, or behave offensively, and he did not hire and fire multiple attorneys or repeatedly delay the trial. State v. Blakeney,

                        <p>
                            Defendant had to receive a new trial because he did not forfeit his right to counsel by engaging in serious misconduct or dilatory tactics after having been warned of the consequences as defendant was not combative or rude; there was no indication defendant
                            had ever previously requested the case to be continued; and, as a whole, defendant's arguments did not appear to be designed to delay or obstruct the proceedings but overall reflected his lack of knowledge or understanding

                            Ineffective Assistance Not Shown. - Under the unique and difficult circumstances here, with the already heavily incriminating evidence against defendant, as well as the apparent likelihood that the discovery of further incriminating evidence could be
                            imminent, the attorneys' decision to disclose potentially incriminating information as to the location of the minor victim with the sought-after goal of avoiding imposition of the death penalty did not fall below an objective
                            standard of reasonableness. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 198</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 797 (2018).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant failed to identify anything that one attorney's allegedly inadequate investigation failed to uncover and that would have had any effect on the reasonableness of his attorneys' strategic decision to make the disclosure of the location of the
                            minor victim, which was made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options; ineffective assistance was not shown. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 198</cite>,
                            813 S.E.2d 797 (2018).

                            Illustrative Cases. - Defendant's contention that the district attorney's argument to the jury referring repeatedly to the fact that defense counsel was from another part of the State constituted prejudicial error and denied the defendant due process
                            and the effective assistance of counsel would be overruled where defense counsel had opened the door with abusive comments attacking the credibility of two State witnesses and the honesty of two local law-enforcement officers.

                        <p>
                            In the absence of any showing that the withdrawal of a motion to consolidate for trial charges against two defendants in any way prejudiced defendant's case and denied him his right to effective counsel, there was no error in denial of his motion to continue.
                            State v. Minshew, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 593, 235 S.E.2d 866 (1977).

                            In a prosecution for kidnapping and assaulting a policeman with a firearm, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a continuance under circumstances in which the 17 days defendant's counsel had to prepare for trial was not a reasonable
                            time to comply with defendant's constitutional right to assistance of counsel in his defense. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 251 S.E.2d 647, appeal dismissed,

                            Trial counsel's failure to move for exclusion of three State's witnesses from the courtroom until each one was called to testify was not evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite>                            52, 270 S.E.2d 559 (1980), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 726</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 286 (1981).

                        <p>
                            Where the record did not indicate any impermissibly suggestive pretrial identification procedures that would have tainted the witnesses' in-court identifications, defendant's counsel's failure to object or move for a voir dire examination was not indicative
                            of ineffective representation. State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 270 S.E.2d 559 (1980), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 726</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Defense counsel's failure to move for dismissal on the grounds of insufficient evidence at the close of all the evidence did not prejudice the defendant and did not constitute ineffective representation, because the sufficiency of the evidence was reviewable
                            on appeal without regard to whether a motion was made at trial. State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 270 S.E.2d 559 (1980), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 726</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The counsel's substandard performance was prejudicial to the rape defendant where the defense's failure to produce any evidence to support the theories proffered at the outset of the trial, including consent of the victim and inability of the defendant
                            to perform the alleged acts, formed the basis of one of the principal closing arguments made by the State in favor of conviction. State v. Moorman, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 387</cite>, 358
                            S.E.2d 502 (1987).

                        <p>
                            The right of a defendant accused of second degree murder to have an attorney of his own choosing was overridden by the trial court's interest in conducting a fair and unbiased legal proceeding where the defendant's counsel had previously represented the
                            victim in her divorce and drafted a power of attorney for her signature prior to her death. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 574 S.E.2d 58 (2002), cert. denied,
                            <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 65</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 572 (2003).

                        <p>
                            As defendant's denial of his pointing of any gun was inconsistent with the defenses of necessity or justification, defendant's attorney made a tactical decision to present a theory of defense based upon defendant's own statements to police; as such, defense
                            counsel's decision not to request jury instructions on necessity and justification with respect to a charge of assault by pointing a gun could not be ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Langley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 194, 618 S.E.2d 253 (2005), cert. dismissed, and denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 366</cite>, 630 S.E.2d 447 (2006).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant failed to show that there was a reasonable probability that, absent out-of-court statements that his counsel failed to object to, the trial result would have been different. Accordingly, his assignment of error based on ineffective assistance
                            of counsel was without merit. State v. Thorne, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 618 S.E.2d 790 (2005).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in permitting defendant to waive counsel and proceed pro se at a probation revocation hearing without first satisfying the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>.
                            Nothing in the record or transcript indicated that defendant understood and appreciated the consequences of his decision to proceed pro se or comprehended the nature of charges and proceedings and the range of possible punishments.

                        <p>
                            Where defendant was charged with first degree murder under the felony murder rule, trial counsel's alleged admissions of fact did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel made the challenged admissions of fact with defendant's
                            consent and defendant expressly consented to counsel's strategy of attempting to persuade the jury that defendant neither intended to kill nor actually killed the murder victim. State v. Pemberton,
                            <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 743 S.E.2d 719 (2013).

                            Double jeopardy argument would have been unsuccessful at trial when defendant was convicted of both second-degree rape and statutory rape, predicated on a single act of sexual intercourse with the fifteen-year-old and mentally disabled victim, because
                            neither of the offenses was a lesser included offense of the other based on the separate and distinct elements that had to be proven for each offense. State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 652</cite>,

                            Defendant did not show counsel's assistance was ineffective for not arguing a warrantless blood draw's constitutionality because defendant showed no prejudice, as (1) defendant could be convicted based on an officer's opinion of appreciable impairment,
                            and (2) evidence of impairment aside from the blood draw was overwhelming. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 802 S.E.2d 566, review denied, 807 S.E.2d 568, 2017 N.C.

                            Defendant Is Entitled to Time and Opportunity to Investigate and Produce Evidence. - Due process requires that every defendant be allowed a reasonable time and opportunity to investigate and produce competent evidence, if he can, in defense of the crime
                            with which he stands charged and to confront his accusers with other testimony. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 690</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 526 (1970).

                            Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motions for a continuance before trial and during trial as the defendant failed to prove he would acquire proof of his innocence because of the continuance. State v. Marecek,

                            Analysis of Evidence by Expert. - In defendant's trial on a charge of first degree murder, the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion for a continuance so she could find an expert to analyze the State's expert's conclusion that there was blood
                            splatter on defendant's clothes which suggested that defendant was present when a victim was struck, and the appellate court ordered a new trial because the State did not carry its burden of showing that the trial court's ruling
                            was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Barlowe, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 578 S.E.2d 660 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err or violate defendant's constitutional rights in denying defendant's motion for a continuance to permit defendant to procure an expert witness to evaluate and testify as to the State of North Carolina's DNA evidence because defendant
                            had sufficient time to review the evidence against defendant and to procure the assistance of an expert, but simply failed to do so in time. State v. King, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite>                            390, 742 S.E.2d 315 (2013).

                            The question as to whether defendant has sufficient time to prepare his defense before trial is one addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, which will not be reviewed on appeal when it is not made to appear that his discretionary power has
                            been abused by him. State v. Burnett, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 783</cite>, 115 S.E. 57 (1922).

                            No set length of time for investigation, preparation and presentation of defense is required, and whether defendant is denied due process must be determined upon the basis of the circumstances of each case. State v. Vick,
                            <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 37</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 335, cert. dismissed, 423 U.S. 918, 96 S. Ct. 228, 46 L. Ed. 2d 367 (1975); State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Denial of Continuance Held Improper. - The defendant was entitled to a new trial because the court's denials of his repeated motions for a continuance resulted in a violation of his constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel, to confront
                            his accusers, and to due process of law. Defendant's counsels had only thirty-four days to prepare for a complex, bifurcated capital case, involving multiple incidents in multiple locations over a two-day period, which they
                            took over from another attorney who had done little other than filing pretrial motions while trying to persuade the defendant to accept a plea bargain. No evidence existed that any witness interviews had been performed; the
                            orders based on the trial court's rulings on pretrial motions had not been prepared; and a jury questionnaire was not submitted for distribution to prospective jurors. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 119</cite>,

                            Delay Forced by Defendant. - There was no constitutional violation where defendant clearly had ample time to confer with counsel, investigate, and present his defense. Defendant may not force a delay in proceedings by retaining counsel and refusing to
                            agree to a fee arrangement. State v. Cuevas, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 468 S.E.2d 425 (1996).

                        <p>
                            Defendant Offered Insufficient Evidence. - The circumstances surrounding the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion to continue did not demonstrate that it was unlikely that the defendant could have received effective assistance of counsel. The
                            defendant failed to offer evidence tending to establish a violation of his constitutional right to a reasonable time to investigate, prepare and present his defense for murder charge and did not show that he had inadequate

                            When Motion for Continuance Presents Question of Law. - Ordinarily, whether a cause shall be continued is a matter which rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and, in the absence of gross abuse, is not subject to review on appeal, but when
                            the motion is based on a right guaranteed by the federal and State Constitutions, the question presented is one of law and not of discretion, and the decision of the court below is reviewable. State v. Farrell,

                            When a motion for a continuance is based on a right guaranteed by the federal and State Constitutions, the question presented is one of law and not of discretion, and the decision of the trial court is reviewable on appeal. State v. Atkinson,

                            Where a motion for continuance is based on a right guaranteed by the Constitution, the decision of the trial judge is reviewable as a question of law without a prior determination that there has been a gross abuse of discretion. State v. Harrill,

                            Indictment, Arraignment and Trial on Same Day. - Defendant's indictment, arraignment, and trial on the same day on a burglary charge was not such a flagrant violation of his due process rights that the court was required to dismiss the indictment, since
                            defendant, by not contesting additional indictments for armed robbery, larceny, and rape conceded that he had been given sufficient time in which to prepare a defense on these charges; the burglary indictment arose out of the
                            same series of events which led to the three other indictments; the offenses took place at such a close proximity in time that any defense which counsel might have prepared to the charge of burglary could not have significantly
                            differed from the defenses he did prepare to the charges of larceny, armed robbery, and rape, and any proof of the nonexistence of the essential elements of burglary would necessarily be included in defendant's defense on the
                            other charges in this case, because for each charge defendant would seek to disprove the State's evidence of the sequence of events leading up to the charge, which facts also supported the burglary indictment. State v. Revelle,

                            of witnesses and the effective assistance of counsel, the trial court's action in allowing the case to proceed to trial upon defendant's motion for a speedy trial and for leave to withdraw his prior motions for a continuance,
                            where no evidence was introduced before the trial court indicating that defendant's impairments had subsided or no longer existed, constituted a denial of defendant's rights to due process of law and equal protection of the

                            New Trial is Not Barred by Death of Defendant's Witness. - To hold that when a defendant in a criminal action by his appeal has secured a new trial, he cannot be prosecuted promptly again, because by the death of a witness who would testify in his favor,
                            if alive, at the time of the retrial, he would in such trial by such death and loss of evidence be denied the right of due process of law under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV and to the rights of "the law of the land" provision of
                            this section, would mean that some, if not many, cases could not be tried again. State v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 359</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 891 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 956, 84

                            When a defendant by his appeal obtains a new trial, the law does not require that the State in order to prosecute him again must guarantee that all his witnesses shall be alive and capable of testifying for him at the retrial, for to require that would
                            be for the law to exact of the State impossibilities. State v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 359</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 891 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 956, 84 S. Ct. 977, 11 L. Ed. 2d 974

                            Trial court's denial of defendant's motion for separate trial so prejudiced his defense as to amount to a denial of due process and his right to confrontation where defendant was precluded under the circumstances of the joint trial from introducing evidence

                            Denial of motion for a continuance to secure the attendance and testimony of a sergeant as a necessary and material witness for the defense was not erroneous because defendant did not articulate any specific facts about which the sergeant would testify

                            could have offered anything to his defense where the assistance of the pathologist sought by defendant would have been of little, if any, value to him, and defendant failed to satisfy his burden of showing either that the assistance
                            of a pathologist would have materially aided him in the preparation of his defense or that the lack thereof deprived him of a fair trial. State v. Moseley, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 1</cite>,

                            where the disclosure of the informer's identity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of the accused, or is essential to fair determination of a cause. State v. Moore,

                            In cross-examination a witness, including a defendant in a criminal case, may be asked all sorts of disparaging questions, and he may be particularly asked whether he has committed specified criminal acts or has been guilty of specified reprehensible

                            A witness, including a defendant in a criminal case, cannot be impeached by cross-examination as to whether he has been arrested for, indicted for or accused of an unrelated criminal offense. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>,

                            Illustrative Cases. - The right of the defendant in a criminal action to cross-examine expert witnesses who have testified against him is a material one, guaranteed by this section of the Constitution, and a denial thereof may not be held as merely a
                            technicality and harmless; nor would this error be cured by the fact that defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine one of these witnesses in refutation of the correctness of the facts upon which his conclusion was based,
                            especially when the other witness was regarded as the most important one. State v. Hightower, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 300</cite>, 121 S.E. 616 (1924).

                            The "law of the land" guaranteed by this section, synonymous with due process of law, guarantees to one charged with contempt of court by an asserted willful violation of a restraining order a right, when he denies the asserted violation, to confront
                            and cross-examine witnesses by whose testimony the asserted violation is to be established. Harriet Cotton Mills v. Local 578, Textile Workers Union, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 218</cite>, 111

                            Trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a continuance did not deprive him of his constitutional rights because defendant was on notice that the victim's wife was a witness he would wish to consult with about his case; defendant's motion for a continuance
                            was not supported by an affidavit and did not describe with any particularity what the wife's testimony would be beyond "exculpatory statements" that would "impeach her own husband and would impeach his credibility." State

                            Use of Closed Circuit Television in Court Room Held Adequate to Provide Defendant Opportunity to Cross-examine Child Victim. - Where, in prosecution for taking indecent liberties with a four-year-old child, during voir dire hearing as to victim's competency
                            as a witness, defendant, although absent from the courtroom, was able to hear all testimony, interact freely with his attorney, and through his attorney confront the victim, thereby accomplishing effective cross-examination,
                            the exclusion of defendant did not violate this section or N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">

                            defendant in the presence of the jury and attorneys, while making defendant go to another room where defendant could watch the proceedings in real time on closed circuit television because defendant's constitutional right to
                            confrontation was not violated as there was a phone in the room so that defendant could cause a signal to flash on the phone on defense counsel's table to indicate that defendant wished to speak with the attorney and defendant's
                            trial counsel had a full opportunity to cross-examine the witness when the witness was on the stand. Furthermore, the testimony of a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist, who had years of training and experience
                            in providing therapy to young victims of trauma, supported the trial court's findings of fact and those findings of fact, in turn, supported the trial court's conclusions of law.

                            The test under the due process clause as to pretrial identification procedure is whether the totality of the circumstances reveals that the pretrial procedures were so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to an irreparable mistaken identification as
                            to offend fundamental standards of decency, fairness and justice. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 228 S.E.2d 768, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 449</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of mistaken identification for due process pretrial identification purposes include (1) the opportunity of the witness to observe the defendant at the time of the crime, (2) the witness' degree of
                            attention, (3) the accuracy of the witness' description of the defendant, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness, and (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. State v. Moses,
                            <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 279 S.E.2d 59, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 318</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 390 (1981).

                            Brevity and Reliability. - Where testifying witness observed defendant during the day, from a short distance, and long enough to notice his unseasonable clothing, the witness's identification of him was not too brief and therefore not inherently incredible,
                            and its admittance into evidence was not violative of his due process rights under this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Showups. - Although the practice of showing suspects singly for identification purposes has been recognized as suggestive and widely condemned, whether such a confrontation violates due process depends upon the totality of the circumstances. State v.
                            Shore, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 328</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 682 (1974).

                            Defendant's motion to suppress the show-up identification was properly denied as it was not impermissibly suggestive and did not create a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, in violation of due process, because, before the alleged
                            robbery occurred, defendant and the other perpetrators followed the victims around in the mall and the parking lot; defendant was two feet away from one of the victims at the time of the robbery; prior to the show-up, the victims
                            gave a physical description of defendant to the police, and defendant matched that description; and, upon approaching the area where defendant and the other perpetrators were detained, all three victims spontaneously shouted
                            that defendant was the robber. State v. Juene, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 823 S.E.2d 889 (2019).

                            Requirements for In-Custody Confrontation for Identification Purposes. - An in-custody confrontation for identification purposes requires that: (1) the accused must be warned of his constitutional right to the presence of counsel during the confrontation;
                            (2) when counsel is not knowingly waived and is not present, the testimony of witnesses that they identified the accused at the confrontation must be excluded; and (3) the in-court identification of the accused by a witness
                            who participated in the pretrial out-of-court confrontation must likewise be excluded unless it is first determined on voir dire that the in-court identification is of independent origin and is thus not tainted by the illegal
                            pretrial identification procedure. Failure to observe these requirements is a denial of due process. State v. Tann, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 89</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 720 (1981).

                        <p>
                            Requirements of Photographic Lineup. - Due process does not require that all subjects in a photographic lineup be identical in appearance, nor is such a lineup impermissibly suggestive merely because the defendant has a distinctive appearance. State v.
                            Tutt, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 615 S.E.2d 688 (2005).

                            Convictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial
                            likelihood of irreparable misidentification. State v. Legette, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 44</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 896 (1977).

                            Photo Identification Procedure Used by Principal Did Not Violate Due Process. - Photo identification evidence did not violate defendant's due process rights where the school principal, who presented the photographs to the witnesses, was not acting as
                            an agent of the State when he conducted the photo identification procedure at the high school; further, the photo identification procedure used was not impermissibly suggestive so as to implicate defendant's due process rights.
                            Because the photo identification evidence was properly admissible, the in-court identifications of defendant by the two witnesses were also properly admissible. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite>                            225, 715 S.E.2d 896 (2011), review dismissed, 723 S.E.2d 767, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 204 (2012); review denied 2012 N.C.

                        <p>
                            In-Court Identification Upheld. - When the trial court found and concluded that the in-court identification of defendant by witnesses was not tainted by any outside confrontation, but was based upon identification during the course of the alleged robbery,
                            and this finding was supported by competent evidence, it alone rendered the in-court identification competent, even it if was conceded arguendo that the showup procedure was improper. State v. Shore,
                            <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 328</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 682 (1974).

                        <p>
                            Where nothing in the record indicated that the out-of-court photographic identification, which identified defendant as the perpetrator of the crime, was unlawful and impermissibly suggestive, the in-court identification was not tainted by the out-of-court
                            identification. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Prior to seeing defendant's photograph, a witness: (1) gave an accurate physical description of defendant as a short, white, heavyset male; (2) correctly identified defendant's first name; (3) gave an accurate description of defendant's residence, which
                            was corroborated by defendant's mother; and (4) told police she knew of defendant and had seen him at the same convenience store in possession of guns one week prior to the shooting; the witness was able to view the criminal
                            before and at the time of the crime and testified she saw defendant lower the gun after the victim was shot and drive away from the scene. A lieutenant showed the witness the picture of defendant on the night of the shooting,
                            while she was at the hospital with the victim, and the time between the crime and the confrontation was short; thus, the photographic identification was not so prejudicial that justice could not have been done, and the trial
                            court did not err when it allowed the witness to make an in-court identification of defendant. State v. Farmer, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 630 S.E.2d 244 (2006).

                        <p>
                            Admission of a pretrial identification and in-court identification of defendant did not violate defendant's due process rights because the pretrial display made to the witness was not done in a manner as to be so impermissibly suggestive, the witness
                            had sufficient opportunity to observe the man he was identifying, and the descriptions provided to investigators were consistent with later observations in the witness' testimony. State v. Pulley,

                            on appellate courts, both State and federal. State v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 197 S.E.2d 35 (1973).

                            <span class="s1">
    §

                            Denial of defendant's motion to suppress a pretrial photo line was proper where none of the five other photos chosen indicated unfairness, nor were they unduly suggestive, and, while the trial court recognized the witness' confusion, it gave weight to
                            a detective's testimony. State v. Tutt, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 615 S.E.2d 688 (2005).

                            Inculpatory Statements. - Cases dealing with a defendant's inculpatory statements project two predominant concerns: (1) that the circumstances surrounding defendant's interrogation do not render his statement inherently unreliable because it was involuntary;
                            and (2) that overzealous officers be deterred from the use of unconstitutional and illegal practices in obtaining a statement from the accused. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 100</cite>,
                            187 S.E.2d 756 (1972), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).

                            Court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress in-custody inculpatory statements he gave to law enforcement officers did not violate his constitutional rights. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 411</cite>, 516

                            Voir Dire Hearing to Determine Voluntariness. - In this jurisdiction, when a purported confession of a defendant is offered into evidence and defendant objects, the trial judge, in the absence of the jury, hears evidence of both the State and the defendant
                            upon the question of the voluntariness of defendant's statements. The general rule is that after such inquiry, when there is conflicting evidence offered at the voir dire hearing, the trial judge shall make findings of fact
                            to show the basis of his ruling on the admissibility of the evidence offered. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 141</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 53 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every statement made by a person in custody as a result of an illegal arrest is not ipso facto involuntary and inadmissible, but the facts and circumstances surrounding such arrest and the in-custody statement should be considered in determining whether
                            the statement is voluntary and admissible. Voluntariness remains as the test of admissibility. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 141</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 53 (1969).

                            Confession Held Voluntary - The granting of defendant's request to see his girlfriend and the mother of his child did not render his confession involuntary where the investigators's statements that they would attempt to contact the women were made only
                            in response to defendant's request, where there was no evidence that investigators used the request as an inducement to obtain his confession, where investigators advised defendant that the police had no control over whether
                            the women came to the station, where defendant himself stated that his confession was not thereby induced, and where the request had no relation to relief from the charges he faced. State v. Wallace,

                            Exhibition of Defendant to Jury. - Defendant was not denied due process of law when he was compelled to exhibit himself to the jury for purpose of allowing police officer to identify certain physical characteristics on defendant's person, since such procedure
                            did not offend the sense of justice implicit in the due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV and this section, but such procedure was simply a logical extension of the rule that witnesses may testify as to a defendant's
                            physical condition or as to identifying marks on his body. State v. McNeil, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 30, 266 S.E.2d 824, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 102</cite>,

                        <p>
                            There is no ban, constitutional or otherwise, against physical restraint in the courtroom per se - What is forbidden by the due process and fair trial guarantees of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV and this section of the North Carolina Constitution is physical
                            restraint that improperly deprives a defendant of a fair trial. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 346 S.E.2d 510 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While, as a general rule, a criminal defendant is entitled to be free from physical restraint at his trial, unless there are extraordinary circumstances which require otherwise, there is no per se prohibition against the use of restraint when it is necessary
                            to maintain order or prevent escape; what is forbidden is physical restraint that improperly deprives a defendant of a fair trial. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 807,
                            571 S.E.2d 274 (2002).

                        <p>
                            A defendant may be physically restrained during his trial when restraint is necessary to maintain order, prevent the defendant's escape, or protect the public. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 450,
                            346 S.E.2d 510 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Defendant is entitled to appear at trial free from bonds or shackles except in extraordinary instances. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the absence of a showing of necessity therefor, compelling the defendant to stand trial while shackled is inherently prejudicial in that it so infringes upon the presumption of innocence that it interferes with a fair and just decision of the question
                            of guilt or innocence. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
                            <br />

                            Burden of Showing Necessity for Shackles on State. - Because of the inherent prejudice engendered by the use of shackles, the rule since the earliest cases has been that the burden of showing necessity for such measures rests upon the State. State v.
                            Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rule against shackling is subject to the exception that the trial judge, in the exercise of his sound discretion, may require the accused to be shackled when such action is necessary to prevent escape, to protect others in the courtroom or to maintain
                            order during trial. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Judicial Discretion in Shackling Defendant. - The power to order a defendant to stand trial while handcuffed or shackled calls for a meaningful exercise of judicial discretion. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>,
                            226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Reasons for Shackling to Be on Record. - When the trial judge, in jury cases, contemplates the necessity of employing unusual visible security measures such as shackles, he should state for the record, out of the presence of the jury, the particular reasons
                            therefor and give counsel an opportunity to voice objections and persuade the court that such measures are unnecessary. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353
                            (1976).

                            Jury Instruction When Defendant Is Shackled. - In any case where the trial judge, in the exercise of sound discretion, determines that the defendant must be handcuffed or shackled, it is of the essence that he instruct the jury in the clearest and most
                            emphatic terms that it must give such restraint no consideration whatever in assessing the proofs and determining guilt. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353
                            (1976).

                            Objection to Shackling Required for Appeal. - Defendant, while ordinarily constitutionally entitled to appear at his own trial free of shackles, must, when shackling is suggested, object to the proposed restraint, and absent reasonable excuse therefor,
                            his failure to do so will ordinarily preclude the shackling from being an issue on appeal. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Test on Appeal. - The propriety of physical restraints on an accused depends upon the particular facts of each case, and the test on appeal is whether, under all the circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion. State v. Tolley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Court Order to Wear Knee Brace. - In view of the fact that a knee brace defendant was required to wear during trial did not make noise or jingle and could not be seen by jurors or potential jurors, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion
                            in requiring the defendant to wear the knee brace. State v. Posey, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 723, 757 S.E.2d 369 (2014).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trial court did not err in ordering that defendant be restrained in the courtroom by the use of shackles, where the evidence tended to show that defendant was charged with crimes of violence; he was 29 years old and apparently in good health; other
                            serious charges were pending against him, including an appeal from a conviction the previous week for which he had received a 40 to 50 year prison sentence; only one deputy was available to serve as bailiff and provide security
                            in the courtroom; and there was an outstanding warrant against him charging him with escape from another jurisdiction. State v. Billups, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 607</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 842

                            Punishment When Person Is Without Knowledge of Facts Making Act Criminal. - It is not a violation of due process to punish a person for certain crimes related to the public welfare or safety, even when the person is without knowledge of the facts making
                            the act criminal, and this is particularly so when the controlling statute does not require the act to have been done knowingly or willfully. Watson Seafood &amp; Poultry Co. v. George W. Thomas, Inc.,

                            beyond petty offenses involving light punishment nor to any crime involving moral delinquency. Watson Seafood &amp; Poultry Co. v. George W. Thomas, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 7</cite>,

                            Due Process for Violations of Motor Vehicle Laws. - The basis for the inclusion of violations of motor vehicle and traffic laws within the scope of the due process rule permitting punishment of persons for certain crimes related to public welfare or safety,
                            even when such persons are without knowledge of the facts making an act criminal, is that (1) the requirement of proving intent or guilty knowledge would make it impossible to enforce such laws in view of the tremendous number
                            of petty offenses growing out of the host of motor vehicles upon the roads, and (2) the punishments for such violations are usually a small fine. Watson Seafood &amp; Poultry Co. v. George W. Thomas, Inc.,

                            Imposition of Punishment in Excess of that Imposed by Inferior Court. - Upon appeal from an inferior court for a trial de novo in the superior court, the superior court may impose punishment in excess of that imposed in the inferior court, provided the
                            punishment imposed does not exceed the statutory maximum. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969); State v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 111</cite>,

                            The fact that defendant received a greater sentence in the superior court than he received in the recorder's court did not constitute a violation of his constitutional or statutory rights. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Applicability of Double Jeopardy Provisions. - Juvenile proceedings in this State do more than merely determine the delinquency of the minor; they may result in severe curtailment of his freedom and, in some cases, in institutional commitment. Although
                            distinctions between juvenile proceedings and criminal prosecutions do still exist, they are sufficiently similar in nature that the double jeopardy provisions of the United States and North Carolina Constitutions are applicable
                            to them. Accordingly, jeopardy attaches to the initial petition once an adjudicatory hearing on the merits is held. In re Drakeford, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 230 S.E.2d 779
                            (1977).

                        <p>
                            Right to Counsel. - In order to comply with due process in a juvenile delinquency proceeding, the right of the juvenile to be represented by an attorney must be considered and an attorney must be provided or there must be a proper waiver of his right.
                            In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 188 S.E.2d 731, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 28</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 702 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Transfer Hearing. - Where the district court held a preliminary hearing, determined whether there was probable cause to believe juveniles guilty, and transferred the case to the superior court, in substance, though not in form, the court complied with
                            the requirements of this section. In re Bullard, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 206 S.E.2d 305, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 758</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 279 (1974).

                            Length of Period Committed to Custody of State. - There is a rational basis for the legislature's disparate treatment of adults and children, and therefore, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba25s7B-2513" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-2513</a></cite>                            was not unconstitutionally applied to a juvenile in derogation of her equal protection rights, notwithstanding that she was committed to the custody of the state for longer than the period for which an adult could have been
                            imprisoned for her conduct, i.e., unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. In re Allison, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 547 S.E.2d 169 (2001).

                            Dividing Line Between Police Power of State and Liberty of Individual. - The police power of the State extends to all the compelling needs of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. Likewise, the liberty protected by the law of the land
                            clause of the State Constitution extends to all fundamental rights of the individual. It is the function of the courts to establish the location of the dividing line between the two. State v. Dobbins,
                            <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 484</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 449 (1971).

                            Any exercise by the State of its police power is a deprivation of liberty. In re Aston Park Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 542</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 729 (1973).
                            <br />

                            For What Purposes Police Power May Be Exercised. - The State possesses the police power in its capacity as a sovereign, and in the exercise thereof, the legislature may enact laws, within constitutional limits, to protect or promote the health, morals,
                            order, safety and general welfare of society. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Effect of Changed Conditions. - In determining the validity of an exercise of the police power, changed conditions as they arise may bring the subject matter in question within the approved testing principle of reasonableness or may remove it therefrom.

                            Police Regulation Can Only Be Justified by Public Interest. - Police regulation of the use or enjoyment of property rights can only be justified by the presence of a public interest, and such property rights may be limited only to the extent necessary
                            to subserve the public interest. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds in State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>,

                            The limit of the police power is the reasonable necessity for the action in order to protect the public. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds in State

                        <p>
                            If a statute is to be sustained as a legitimate exercise of the police power, it must have a rational, real, or substantial relation to the public health, morals, order, or safety, or the general welfare. In re Aston Park Hosp.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 542</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 729 (1973); North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 195 S.E.2d 357 (1973); In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>,

                            Question of Degree and of Reasonableness. - Whether a statute is a violation of the law of the land clause or is a valid exercise of the police power is a question of degree and of reasonableness in relation to the public good likely to result from it.
                            North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 195 S.E.2d 357 (1973).

                            Test of Validity. - When the exercise of the police power is challenged on constitutional grounds, the validity of the police regulation primarily depends on whether, under all the surrounding circumstances and particular facts of the case, the regulation
                            is reasonably calculated to accomplish a purpose falling within the police power without burdening unduly the person or corporation affected. Southern Ry. v.

                            Zoning regulations must pass a two-pronged test in order to comply with substantive due process. First, the regulation must be designed to achieve objectives within the scope of the police power. Second, it must seek to achieve those objectives by reasonable
                            means. Whether the means are reasonable depends on their promotion of the public good and their reasonably minimal interference with the property owner's right to use his property as he deems appropriate. Goodman Toyota, Inc.

                            Owner not Deprived of Due Process Because Nonconforming Use Denied. - The fact that a lot would be more valuable if devoted to a nonconforming use does not deprive the owner of property without due process of law when zoning regulations are uniform in
                            their application to all within the respective districts, and when the differentiation of the uses of property within the respective districts is in accordance with a comprehensive plan in the interest of the health, safety,

                            Method of Implementation of Police Power. - Although the object of particular legislation may well be within the scope of the police power, the legislation may yet deprive individuals of due process of law if the means chosen to implement the legislative
                            objective are unreasonable. A-S-P Assocs. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 207</cite>, 258 S.E.2d 444 (1979).

                            or morals or the general welfare, and when necessary to safeguard such public interest, it may be exercised, without payment of compensation to the owner, even though the property is thereby rendered substantially worthless.

                            The "vested rights" doctrine has evolved as a constitutional limitation on the State's exercise of its police power to restrict an individual's use of private property by the enactment of zoning ordinances; the doctrine is rooted in the "due process of
                            law" and the "law of the land" clauses of the federal and State Constitutions. Godfrey v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 51</cite>, 344 S.E.2d 272 (1986).

                            Regulation of Property Based on Aesthetic Considerations Is Permitted. - Reasonable regulation of property based on aesthetic considerations may constitute a valid basis for the exercise of the police power, depending on the facts and circumstances of
                            each case. Previous cases are overruled to the extent that they prohibited regulation based upon aesthetic considerations alone. State. v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d

                            Regulation based on aesthetic considerations may constitute a valid basis for the exercise of the police power depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. When other worthwhile objectives are also realized (for example, improvement of traffic
                            safety and the protection of property values) the challenged regulation will be deemed to be within the range of permissible purposes properly achieved through use of the police power. Goodman Toyota, Inc. v. City of Raleigh,

                            not delegate such responsibility to subordinate groups or organizations which are not authorized by the General Assembly to exercise the police power. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>,

                            Test for Regulation of Property Based on Aesthetic Considerations. - The diminution in value of an individual's property should be balanced against the corresponding gain to the public from such regulation. Some of the factors which should be considered
                            and weighed in applying such a balancing test include such private concerns such as whether the regulation results in confiscation of the most substantial part of the value of the property or deprives the property owner of
                            the property's reasonable use, and such public concerns as the purpose of the regulation and the manner of achieving a permitted purpose. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>,

                            Aesthetic regulations may provide corollary benefits to the general community such as protection of property values, promotion of tourism, indirect protection of health and safety, preservation of the character and integrity of the community, and promotion
                            of the comfort, happiness, and emotional stability of area residents. Such corollary community benefits would be factors to be considered in balancing the public interests in regulation against the individual property owner's
                            interest in the use of his property free from regulation. The test focuses on the reasonableness of the regulation by determining whether the aesthetic purpose to which the regulation is reasonably related outweighs the burdens
                            imposed on the private property owner by the regulation. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).

                            Demolition of House for Nonconformity with City Housing Code. - An action by a municipality, pursuant to an ordinance adopted under the authority of former G.S. 160-182, in ordering the demolition of a dwelling house without compensation to the owner
                            thereof, and in charging the expense of demolition to the owner upon his failure to demolish the house himself, such action being based upon findings by the city building inspector that the house was unfit for human habitation
                            and that the repairs necessary to bring the house into conformity with the housing code would cost 60% or more of the present value of the house, was violative of the Constitution of this State, where (1) the house could be
                            repaired so as to comply with the housing code, and (2) the owner was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to repair the house. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177

                            Where it appears from the findings of a city housing commission that a house can be repaired so as to comply with the city's housing code, be suitable for human habitation and be no longer a threat to public health, safety, morals or general welfare,
                            to require its destruction without giving the owner a reasonable opportunity thus to remove the existing threat to the public health, safety and welfare is arbitrary and unreasonable. Such power may not be delegated to or exercised

                            Prohibitions Apply to All Three Branches of Government. - The constitutional prohibitions against the taking of private property without due process of law limit the powers of the executive and judicial branches as well as the legislative branch. In re

                            Test to Determine Whether Taking Has Occurred. - The test to determine whether a taking of private property for public use has occurred involves as two-part analysis. An "ends-means" test is applied to decide whether that particular exercise of the police
                            power was legitimate, by determining whether the ends sought, i.e., the object of the legislation, is within the scope of the power, and then whether the means chosen to regulate are reasonable. Finch v. City of Durham,

                            The test for determining whether a taking has occurred in the context of a rezoning is whether the property as rezoned has a practical use and a reasonable value. Finch v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 352</cite>,

                            What Persons Are Protected by Limitation on Taking Property. - The constitutional limitation against taking of property of a citizen affords the same protection to a mentally ill person that it affords to a person of sound mind. In re Kenan,

                            Applicability to Interest and Principal. - The constitutional provision that no person shall be deprived of his property except by the law of the land applies to interest or earnings on funds in the same manner as it applies to principal. McMillan v.
                            Robeson County, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 413</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 105 (1964).

                            Zoning restrictions on property may be so strict as to amount to a taking of that property. However, for there to be such a "taking," the restriction must deprive the owner of virtually all the beneficial uses of his land. Sherrill v. Town of Wrightsville

                            Power of Eminent Domain Is Inherent in Sovereignty. - The power of eminent domain, that is, the right to take private property for public use, is inherent in sovereignty. This section requires payment of fair compensation for the property so taken. This
                            is the only limitation imposed on sovereignty with respect to taking. Town of Morganton v. Hutton &amp; Bourbonnais Co., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 531</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 111 (1960).

                            The right to take private property for public use exists independently of constitutional provisions. In fact, such provisions are limitations on the State's power to exercise the right. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins,

                            of this power in a private capacity in contravention of this section. Whiting Mfg. Co. v. Carolina Aluminum Co., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 52</cite>, 175 S.E. 698 (1934).

                            Deprivation of Previously Available Property Rights. - A taking does not occur simply because government action deprives an owner of previously available property rights. Finch v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 352</cite>,

                            Riparian rights are vested property rights that cannot be taken for private purposes or taken for public purposes without compensating the owner, and they arise out of ownership of land bounded or traversed by navigable water. In re Mason ex rel. Huber,

                            Entry Before Bringing Proceedings. - The statute, authorizing the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) to enter upon and take possession of lands before bringing condemnation proceedings and before making compensation, is not an
                            infraction of constitutional rights and does not deprive an owner of notice and opportunity to be heard. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 603</cite>, 158

                            To take property without the owner's consent for a nonpublic use, even if he is paid its full value, is a violation of this section and of the due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Thornton,

                            What is a "public use" justifying the exercise of the power of eminent domain cannot be stated with precision for all cases. Each case must be evaluated in the light of its peculiar circumstances and the then current opinion as to the proper function

                            In a declaratory judgment action challenging a city's condemnation proceeding for expansion of the city's sewer system, a judgment for the city was proper because the intended use of the condemnation satisfied the public use and public benefit test as
                            all city residents, including the landowners whose property was being condemned, would have the equal right to connect to the expanded sewer system, which was an essential service. Tucker v. City of Kannapolis,

                            use by visitors, it is not a public road, and the property of another person cannot be taken for its construction under the power of eminent domain. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Thornton, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 227</cite>,

                            Town's condemnation action was properly dismissed because property owners showed the action served no public benefit, as (1) the action would not "open" a street, since the street had not been closed, as access to the street was never blocked, and other
                            portions of the street were not public, especially when the property was at the end of a dead-end street, (2) condemnation would not provide neighbors' access to land, utility service provider access, fire fighters' access
                            to water, or general community interconnectedness, and (3) the evidence showed the town was motivated by considerations irrelevant to the public benefit.

                            Economic benefits to the community, anticipated from the attraction to it of a large and wealthy prospective employer, are not determinative of whether property taken in order to accomplish that purpose is taken for a "public use." The home or other property
                            of a poor man cannot be taken from him by eminent domain and turned over to the private use of a wealthy individual or corporation merely because the latter may be expected to spend more money in the community, even though
                            he or it threatens to settle elsewhere if this is not done. This the Constitution forbids. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Thornton, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 227</cite>, 156 S.E.2d 248 (1967), commented

                            For a county to take land from the owners without their consent for a use incidental to a proposed airport, which airport the county may not lawfully construct and operate, would be a vain and utterly useless deprivation of the landowners' rights in their
                            property, and such an arbitrary, capricious taking of their land would be a violation of this section. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967).

                            North Carolina does not have an express constitutional provision against the taking of private property for public use without the payment of just compensation. However, North Carolina recognizes this fundamental right to just compensation as so grounded
                            in natural law and justice that it is part of the fundamental law of the State, and imposes upon a governmental agency taking private property for public use a correlative duty to make just compensation to the owner of the
                            property taken. This principle is considered in North Carolina as an integral part of "the law of the land" within the meaning of this section. DeBruhl v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n,

                            of private property for public use, whether that use is proprietary or governmental in nature. The test of liability is whether, notwithstanding its acts are governmental in nature and for a lawful public purpose, the municipality's
                            acts amount to a partial taking of private property. If so, just compensation must be paid. Long v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 187</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 101 (1982).

                            as compensation not only the fair market value of their property as of the date of the taking, but also some additional sum for the substantial delay in the payment of the fair market value of their property so taken, as an

                            When the taking of property by the State precedes the payment of compensation, the owner is entitled to additional compensation for the delay in payment. This section and U.S. Const., Amends. V and XIV require this additional payment as a part of just
                            compensation. The additional sum awarded for delay in payment of the value for the property taken is not interest eo nomine, but interest is a fair means for measuring the amount to be arrived at of such additional sums. Lea

                            Substitute condemnation is a transaction in which the State or an agency with the power of eminent domain, A, takes land under an agreement to compensate its owner, B, with land to be taken in condemnation proceedings from a third person, C, instead of
                            with money. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 459</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 272 (1972).

                            There is no denial of due process or other constitutional infirmity in substitute condemnations where the owner of the land first taken, with whom the ultimate condemnee's land is to be exchanged, also has the power of condemnation and could itself have
                            condemned the land. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 459</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 272 (1972).

                            Public Use and Necessity in Substitute Condemnation. - In controversies concerning substitute condemnation, the questions of public use and necessity are inseparable. Whether land has been taken for a public use in a substitute condemnation will depend
                            on whether fairness requires that B, whose land has been taken for an undisputed public purpose, be compensated in land and whether there is a close factual connection between the taking of B's land and C's land, taken to compensate
                            B. Whether it is necessary to exercise the power of eminent domain will turn on whether B can be fairly compensated only in land. Whether it is necessary to take C's property depends on whether there is a close factual connection
                            between the two takings. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 459</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 272 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Substitute condemnation is a valid exercise of a power of eminent domain only when the substitution of other property is the sole method by which the owner of land taken for public use can be justly compensated, and the practical problems resulting from
                            the taking can be solved. It can only be justified when the property for which land is substituted accomplishes the public purpose for which it was taken, and the cost is not disproportionate to the benefit derived. North Carolina

                            Taxing of One District to Benefit Another. - It is a fundamental principle in the law of taxation that taxes may only be levied for public purposes and for the benefit of the public on whom they are imposed. To lay these burdens upon one district for
                            benefits appertaining solely to another is in clear violation of established principles of right and contrary to the express provision of this section, which forbids that any person shall be disseized of his freehold liberties
                            and privileges or in any manner deprived of his life, liberty or property but by the law of the land. Commissioners of Johnston County v. Lacy, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 141</cite>, 93 S.E.

                            Free or reduced telephone service to municipalities constitutes a tax prohibited by law, and is discriminatory both as between towns which are similarly situated and as between those towns and individual rate payers living in towns or in the country.
                            Hence, former G.S. 160-281.2 was unconstitutional because it offended the due process provisions of both the State and federal Constitutions, because it was not a uniform tax, because it interfered with vested rights, and because
                            it was an attempt to surrender the police power of the State. State ex rel. North Carolina Util. Comm'n v. City of Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 640</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 786 (1960).

                            constitutions where the trust did not have sufficient minimum contacts with the State and due process was not satisfied solely from the beneficiaries' contacts with North Carolina since the trust and the trust's beneficiaries

                            to be affected, and if the description is not so definite, a sale thereunder will be void as not complying with the statute, as taking property without giving notice, and as not affording those whose property is sold an opportunity

                            into an area to be annexed at a fixed future date after the residents of the area to be annexed have approved the annexation and the citizens of the municipality have approved both the annexation and the issuance of bonds.
                            Such bonds are for a public purpose, and the tax imposed within the municipality prior to annexation does not deprive the taxpayers of the city of property without due process of law. Thomasson v. Smith,

                            high tax bases, and that the operation of five separate school systems in that county prohibited effective use of facilities and staff and promoted inequitable use of state and local funds, thus depriving them of equal opportunity

                            Eligibility for In-State Tuition. - A person's right to eligibility for in-state tuition is quite different from his basic constitutional right to travel freely from one state to another or his basic constitutional right to vote. Moreover, the regulations
                            of the Board of Trustees of The University of North Carolina concerning eligibility for in-state tuition do not impede interstate travel. And since they do not relate to basic constitutional rights, such regulations are to
                            be tested by the less stringent traditional equal protection standards, that test being whether the regulations have tended in general to assure that only North Carolina citizens get the benefit of in-state tuition, which the

                            The right to work and earn a livelihood is a property right, considered fundamental under the North Carolina Constitution; consequently, regulation of otherwise lawful occupations and businesses must be based on some distinguishing feature in the business
                            itself or in the manner in which it is ordinarily conducted, the natural and probable consequence of which, if unregulated, is to produce substantial injury to the public peace, health, or welfare. Poor Richard's, Inc. v. Stone,

                            Suspension of License. - The availability of prompt postsuspension review, along with a relatively brief suspension period, reduces the weight of the private interest in a suspended attorney's continued use of his or her law license pending the outcome
                            of the postsuspension hearing. In re Lamm, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 448 S.E.2d 125 (1994), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 196</cite>, 458 S.E.2d 921 (1995).

                            Right to Engage in Lawful Business. - When the State's exercise of its police power works to deny a person, association or corporation the right to engage in a business which is otherwise lawful, such deprivation of liberty requires a substantially greater
                            likelihood of benefit to the public in order to enable it to survive an attack based upon this section. North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite>                            701, 195 S.E.2d 357 (1973).

                        <p>
                            To deny a person, association or corporation the right to engage in a business which is otherwise lawful is a far greater restriction upon his or its liberty than to deny the right to charge in that business whatever prices the owner sees fit to charge
                            for service. Consequently, such a deprivation of liberty requires a substantially greater likelihood of benefit to the public in order to enable it to survive an attack based upon this section. In re Aston Park Hosp.,

                            Freedom to contract and engage in a lawful business activity are rights guaranteed by the State and federal constitutions. However, these rights are not absolute, and limitations thereon imposed by the legislature are not violative of constitutional provisions
                            so long as they are reasonable in light of the purposes to be accomplished. Louchheim, Eng &amp; People, Inc. v. Carson, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 241 S.E.2d 401 (1978).

                            Sovereign immunity is not a defense to an action against the State for breach of a contract entered into by the State's authorized officers and agencies, since to deny the party who has performed his obligation under a contract the right to sue the State
                            when it defaults is to take his property without compensation and thus to deny him due process. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).

                            Trial court did not err in denying the State's sovereign immunity defense in state employees' breach of contract action because a contract between the State Health Plan and an insurance company was made to confer longterm care benefits directly upon state
                            employees as consideration for their employment; (1) sovereign immunity may be waived when the State enters into a valid contract; (2) when the State waives sovereign immunity, it occupies the same position as any other litigant;
                            (3) when the State occupies the same position as any other litigant, it may be sued by a third party to enforce a contract made for the direct benefit of that third party; and (4) sovereign immunity does not bar third-party

                            restricting a former officer's ability to collect a special separation allowance, impaired the obligation of the state's contract with former officer under the retirement system; because the resolution was enacted after the
                            former officer had retired and his right to receive the special separation had become vested, it was improper. Wiggs v. Edgecombe County, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 47, 632 S.E.2d 249 (2006), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 318</cite>,

                            No Constitutional Right to Erosion Control. - Plaintiffs' claim that hardened structure rules promulgated by defendants effected a taking of property without just compensation and violated <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.113A.html#t113Aa07s113A-128" target="_blank">G.S. 113A-128</a></cite>                            of the Coastal Area Management Act were properly dismissed, because plaintiffs failed to cite any persuasive authority for the proposition that a littoral or riparian landowner has a right to erect hardened structures in statutorily

                            to public enjoyment of such areas, are clearly rationally related to legitimate government interests and, therefore, did not violate plaintiffs' equal protection rights. Shell Island Homeowners Ass'n v. Tomlinson,

                            When Statute Will Be Declared Invalid. - It is only when a classification or distinction in a statute is arbitrary and unjustifiable upon any reasonable view that it becomes invidious and offensive to the Constitution, so that the court may undertake
                            to exercise the extraordinary power it possesses to declare the statute void. The unconstitutionality must clearly appear before the court can so declare it. Vinson v.

                            The burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests upon him who assails it, and courts may not declare a legislative discrimination invalid unless, viewed in the light of facts made known or generally assumed, it is of such a character
                            as to preclude the assumption that the classification rests upon some rational basis within the knowledge and experience of the legislators. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>,

                            Reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of constitutionality of an act of the General Assembly, so that a statute will not be declared unconstitutional unless it is clearly so.

                            A municipal ordinance is presumed to be valid, and the burden is upon the complaining party to show its invalidity or inapplicability. Moreover, a municipal ordinance promulgated in the exercise of the police power will not be declared unconstitutional
                            unless it is clearly so, and every intendment will be made to sustain it. Currituck County v. Willey, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 835, 266 S.E.2d 52, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 234</cite>,

                            The party assailing the constitutionality of an ordinance must carry the burden of showing that the ordinance does not rest upon any reasonable basis, but is essentially arbitrary; and if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain
                            the ordinance, the existence of that state of facts at the time the ordinance was enacted must be assumed. Currituck County v. Willey, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 835, 266 S.E.2d 52,

                            While North Carolina's ballot access scheme inevitably burdened the associational rights of members of small parties as well as the informational interests of all voters regardless of their party affiliation, it also found that associational rights were
                            not absolute and were necessarily subject to qualification if elections were to be run fairly and effectively. Because a legislative enactment had to be upheld unless its unconstitutionality clearly and unmistakably appeared
                            beyond a reasonable doubt or it could not be upheld on any reasonable ground, the appellate court held that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a09s163-96ol1a2" target="_blank">G.S. 163-96(a)(2)</a></cite>                            was not violative of N.C.

                            tenants was rationally related to the goal of decreasing over-occupancy; the practice of more avidly enforcing the housing code against owners than against transient tenants was reasonably calculated to effectively secure compliance

                            A county sign ordinance does not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV or this section merely because the county will not enforce the ordinance with respect to any person owning or operating a sign in certain municipalities within
                            the county, since counties may not exercise zoning authority within a city which has enacted a zoning ordinance and counties may defer from zoning within cities. County of Cumberland v. Eastern Fed. Corp.,

                            which prohibited the ex-felon from possessing handguns outside his home or business, and since the regulation was reasonably related to further securing the public's safety, there was no interference with any vested right when

                            the State properly and timely notified defendant more than six weeks before trial of its intent to prove the existence of three aggravating factors against defendant and the statute at issue applied to all defendants against

                            Search and Seizure. - Where an officer observed defendant drive over a curb, back away from the officer, and reach into a pocket in a location known for drug activity, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the officer had reasonable
                            suspicion to make an investigatory stop and had probable cause to seize a film canister from defendant's pocket during a pat-down for weapons based on, inter alia, defendant's actions, the area's reputation, and the officer's
                            prior experiences. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 658 S.E.2d 501 (2008).

                            In a case in which the trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress finding that his arrest was illegal and as such was a violation of his right to be free from unreasonable seizures, the State appealed, arguing successfully that the trial court
                            erred in basing its decision on whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave during the interaction, rather than determining whether there existed special circumstances which would justify a law enforcement officer's
                            actions, and whether those actions were the least intrusive means of carrying out the purpose of the stop. The trial court had to determine whether special circumstances existed that would have justified the officer's use of
                            handcuffs such that they remained the least intrusive means reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of the stop. State v. Carrouthers, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 683 S.E.2d

                            Findings of fact supported a conclusion of reasonable suspicion on the part of a police officer to stop and frisk defendant because, due to the high crime area in which the stop occurred, the officer's experience and knowledge of the area, and defendant's
                            behavior when defendant saw the officer in defendant using defendant's right hand to grab defendant's waistband to clinch an item, the officer had a reasonable suspicion both to stop defendant and frisk defendant for weapons.

                            sex offender from another jurisdiction, who subsequently moved to North Carolina, because such a defendant has actual notice of his or her lifelong duty to register as a result of his or her out-of-state conviction, which provides
                            a reasonable individual to inquire of a duty to register in any state upon relocation. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 554</cite>, 614 S.E.2d 479 (2005).

                            Short Form Murder Indictment Lacking Elements of Premeditation and Deliberation Upheld. - The court rejected the defendant's argument that because the indictment failed to allege two essential elements of first degree murder, i.e., premeditation and deliberation,
                            his conviction of first degree murder based thereon violated Article I,

                            of Child Development and Early Education, because the day care center had an adequate state remedy before the North Carolina Industrial Commission, which could hear tort claims against state agencies, which the day care center
                            pursued, as (1) the day care center could have been compensated for the day care center's constitutional claim, and (2) the day care center's non-compliance with the statute of limitations did not render that remedy inadequate.

                            Teachers. - It was not a denial of equal protection for the State to prescribe one procedure for the dismissal of a school teacher during the school year on the ground of immoral or disreputable conduct or failure to perform the teacher's contract, and
                            to prescribe a different procedure for the termination of the employment at the end of the school year under former G.S. 115-142. The vast difference in the consequences of these two actions, insofar as the future effect upon
                            the teacher's professional standing and ability to obtain employment was concerned, was ample basis for classification within the limits of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV and of this section. Still v. Lance,

                            A regulation of the State Board of Education which requires all teachers employed in the public school system of North Carolina to obtain a renewal of their teaching certificates every five years and prescribes for all teachers the same number of credits
                            and the same methods for obtaining such credits does not deny equal protection of the law, notwithstanding the fact that the regulation does not apply to employees of the Board who are not engaged in teaching, whose duties
                            are performed in the Board's offices. Since the purpose of requiring a certificate to teach is to assure good quality of performance in the classroom, there is an obvious and reasonable basis for making the rule applicable

                            of the fee or by which the students or parents themselves might apply for a partial or complete exemption from the fee requirements, since the waiver policy did not fairly guarantee to low income and indigent students their

                            Military Property Sales Facilities. - If the State's primary purpose in Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.127B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 127B</a></cite> is to prevent the owners of military property
                            sales businesses from illegally purchasing property which they believe may be stolen, that section cannot stand, as the State may not undertake by regulation to rid ordinary occupations and callings of the dishonest; likewise,
                            if the State, by this regulatory statute, is seeking to enlist plaintiff's aid in enforcing already existing criminal laws, either by allowing the State to trace the property to its criminal source, or to deter its disposition,
                            and, therefore, its theft, it is also unconstitutional, as those who buy and sell military surplus property may not be required to incur additional expense, or abandon that part of their business, to assist in enforcing criminal

                            Generally. - This section does not deprive the legislature of authority to prohibit by a statute, otherwise valid, the carrying on of and engaging in, on Sunday, any and all labor and the operation of industrial and commercial pursuits, except for works
                            of necessity and acts which, themselves, are in exercise of the constitutional right to worship. Moreover, the legislature may delegate this power to municipalities. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Neither the State nor the federal Constitution requires that a statute or ordinance, enacted for establishing Sunday as a day of rest, be held invalid unless it prohibits every activity which could be brought within its scope. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales,
                            Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The legislative body has a wide discretion in determining which activities do and which do not interfere with the observance of Sunday as a day of general rest and relaxation sufficiently to justify the prohibition of those activities on that day, and
                            the burden rests upon the person complaining to establish the absence of a reasonable basis for such determination. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>,
                            174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the objective of a municipal ordinance is the establishment of Sunday as a day of general rest and relaxation, the difference in treatment by the ordinance of two types of business must be supported by a reasonable basis for the conclusion that
                            one, substantially more than the other, will interfere with such use and enjoyment of the day. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d
                            542 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The general rule is that the enactment of Sunday regulations is a legitimate exercise of the police power, and that the classification on which a Sunday law is based is within the discretion of the legislative branch of the government or within the discretion
                            of the governing body of a municipality clothed with power to enact and enforce ordinances for the observance of Sunday, and will be upheld, provided the classification is founded upon reasonable distinctions, affects all persons
                            similarly situated or engaged in the same business without discrimination, and has some reasonable relation to the public peace, welfare and safety. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>,
                            187 S.E.2d 8 (1972).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The validity of a Sunday closing statute or ordinance depends upon its reasonable relation to the accomplishment of the State's legitimate objective, which, in this instance, is the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare by the establishment
                            of a day of rest and relaxation. Legislation for this purpose, like other legislation, may not discriminate arbitrarily either as between persons, or groups of persons, or as between activities which are prohibited and those
                            which are permitted. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 8 (1972).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order for a Sunday closing ordinance to withstand an attack upon its constitutionality, it is not necessary that the legislative body prohibited everything which is detrimental to the public morals, health or safety; it is sufficient that there is
                            reasonable basis for belief that the operation on the day of rest of excepted businesses is necessary or conducive to the enjoyment by the public of the designated day as a day of rest, and that the activities of the defendant
                            are not. State v. Atlas, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 165</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 496 (1973).

                            Unconstitutional discrimination in a county ordinance requiring businesses generally to be closed on a specified day of the week, designated by the legislative body as a day of rest, but exempting from such requirement certain types of business, is not
                            shown by the fact that the ordinance of some other county or municipality does not contain identical exemptions from its general closing requirement. State v. Atlas, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 165</cite>,

                            An ordinance prohibiting generally the operation of all businesses within a municipality on Sunday, but excepting certain businesses, was held not to violate this section. Clark's Charlotte, Inc. v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 222</cite>,

                            Ordinances prohibiting the exercise of all occupations generally on Sunday, "except those of necessity and charity," are constitutional, and exceptions are valid if they are reasonable and do not discriminate within a class between competitors similarly
                            situated. Charles Stores Co. v. Tucker, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 710</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 370 (1965).

                            unreasonable and discriminatory. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).

                            A Sunday observance ordinance which classified "sporting goods and toys" as prohibited items and live bait as permitted items could not be considered unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Tomlinson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 1</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 236 (1969).

                            A municipal ordinance which prohibited the sale on Sunday of mobile homes but which did not prohibit the sale of conventional homes would be held valid, since a classification based on the differences between the two types of selling (presence or absence
                            of traffic, congestion, and noise) bore a reasonable relation to the purpose of the ordinance in establishing Sunday as a day of rest and relaxation. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson,

                            A Sunday closing ordinance which singled out and banned the operation of billiard halls on Sunday but permitted other businesses which provided facilities for recreation, sports and amusements, which were potentially equally disruptive, violated the equal
                            protection clauses of the North Carolina and United States Constitutions. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 8 (1972).

                            Search and Seizure Requirements Under U.S. Const., Amend. IV Compared. - Though the language in this section, providing in substance that any search or seizure must be "supported by evidence," is markedly different from that in the federal Constitution,
                            there is no variance between the search and seizure law of North Carolina and the requirements of U.S. Const., Amend. IV as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States. State v. Hendricks,
                            <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 258 S.E.2d 872 (1979), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 123</cite>, 262 S.E.2d 6 (1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pointing to the differences in language in the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and this section of the North Carolina Constitution, the North Carolina Constitution is more protective of a person's privacy and requires a stricter standard
                            in justifying a warrantless search. State v. Mills, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 411 S.E.2d 193 (1991).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The language of this section differs markedly from the language of U.S. Const., Amend. IV. Nevertheless, this section prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. State v. Arrington, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 633</cite>,
                            319 S.E.2d 254 (1984).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This section does not require more particularity in subpoenas than does U.S. Const., Amend. IV as applied to the states through U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. In re Computer Technology Corp., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite>                            402, 337 S.E.2d 165 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Other State Remedies Must Be Exhausted. - A state constitutional action is not proper under this section, unless no other state remedy is available; here, an existing state tort remedy precluded plaintiff's assault-based constitutional claim against an
                            arresting officer. Glenn-Robinson v. Acker, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 538 S.E.2d 601 (2000).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was not error to grant summary judgment in favor of a police officer and a city, as to a citizen's claims under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span> 19, 20, 21, and 35, based on the officer's alleged use of excessive force, because the fact that the citizen had to overcome the affirmative defense of public officer immunity to succeed on the citizen's tort claims
                            did not negate the claims' adequacy as a remedy, so a direct cause of action under the North Carolina Constitution was not permitted. Debaun v. Kuszaj, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 767 S.E.2d 353 (2014).

                        <p>
                            Standing to Object to Search. - Burglary defendant had no standing to object to the search of a car from which evidence was taken by the FBI where, although defendant had paid $3,500 of the $4,000 purchase price, the owner of the car dealership retained
                            title and had given his consent to the search. State v. Mandina, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 373 S.E.2d 155 (1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant did not have standing to contend that the search and seizure of a briefcase and its contents violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 20 of the North Carolina Constitution, where the defendant presented no evidence that he asserted any ownership or possessory interest in the briefcase. State v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite>                            265, 450 S.E.2d 503 (1994).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant was not seized under the Fourth Amendment when the officer activated the blue lights on his patrol car because he chose to continue driving and did not submit to the officer's authority. The seizure occurred approximately two minutes later when
                            defendant stopped his vehicle. State v. Mangum, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 714, 795 S.E.2d 106 (2016), review denied, stay lifted, stay denied, 797 S.E.2d 8, 2017, N.C. LEXIS 168

                            Abandoned Property. - For abandonment to occur, the discarding of property must occur in a public place; one simply cannot abandon property within the curtilage of one's own home.

                            Open Field. - Land consisting of nearly 119 acres of wooded land constituted an "open field," so that the investigating officers' entry onto the property and the observations that they made while they were there did not constitute a search for U.S. Const.,

                            No Expectation of Privacy in Property Relinquished to Another. - When one voluntarily puts property under the control of another, he must be viewed as having relinquished any prior legitimate expectation of privacy with regard to that property, as it
                            becomes subject to public exposure upon the whim of the other person. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 765, 513 S.E.2d 568 (1999).

                            Trial court erred in requiring defendant to enroll in lifetime satellite-based monitoring following his future release from prison because defendant was not a "recidivist," would not be released from prison for 30 to 43 years, and the State failed to
                            establish that lifetime satellite-based monitoring following defendant's eventual release from prison was a reasonable search where the State made no attempt to report the level of intrusion as to the information revealed under
                            the satellite-based monitoring program, nor did it establish that the nature and extent of the monitoring that was currently administered, and upon which the present order was based, would remain unchanged by the time that
                            defendant was released from prison. State v. Strudwick, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).

                            Traffic Stop Was Not Unconstitutional. - Trial court's finding that at the time defendant's vehicle changed lanes without a signal, it was being operated by defendant immediately in front of an arresting officer's vehicle indicated that defendant's failure
                            to signal violated <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-154ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 20-154(a)</a></cite> because it was clear that changing lanes immediately in front
                            of another vehicle might affect the operation of the trailing vehicle; the officer's observation of the traffic violation gave him the required reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle such that the stop was not unconstitutional.
                            State v. Styles, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 412</cite>, 665 S.E.2d 438 (2008).

                        <p>
                            Reasonable Suspicion for Investigatory Stop. - As a general rule, a stop made for investigatory purposes is reasonable, and therefore constitutional, when the investigating officer has a reasonable suspicion, supported by articulable facts, that the person
                            seized may have engaged in or may be engaged in criminal activity. State v. Schiffer, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 510 S.E.2d 165 (1999).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The level of suspicion required for an investigatory stop is lower than what is required for a seizure based on probable cause, which is a suspicion produced by such facts as indicate a fair probability that the person seized has engaged in or is engaged
                            in criminal activity. State v. Schiffer, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 510 S.E.2d 165 (1999).

                            Defendant was not illegally seized in contravention of his constitutional rights, as an officer did not tell defendant he could not leave, defendant had consented to speak with the officer, and the officer had not restrained defendant's freedom to walk
                            away. Defendant had no driver's license with him and did not know the name of a friend to whom his car belonged; these articulable facts were sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion in the mind of a trained police
                            officer that defendant was involved in criminal activity, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. State v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 644</cite>,
                            617 S.E.2d 1 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity justifying the stop of defendant's vehicle did not exist where a detective only observed defendant weaving within defendant's lane and the detective did not observe defendant violating any laws such
                            as driving above or below the speed limit. Furthermore, defendant was stopped during the afternoon, not an unusual hour, and there was no evidence that defendant was near any places that sold alcohol. State v. Fields,
                            <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 740, 673 S.E.2d 765 (2009).

                        <p>
                            Officer had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle where an anonymous tip was received about an intoxicated person driving, and the officer's subsequent observations corroborated the tip. The officer testified that defendant consistently drove
                            15 miles below the speed limit, he stopped longer than usual at a corner and a railroad crossing, and he failed to pull over when the officer activated his lights, but continued driving for two minutes before finally stopping
                            in the middle of the street. State v. Mangum, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 714, 795 S.E.2d 106 (2016), review denied, stay lifted, stay denied, 797 S.E.2d 8, 2017, N.C. LEXIS 168 (2017),

                        <p>
                            When a criminal defendant files a motion to suppress challenging an investigatory stop, the trial court can deny that motion only if it concludes, after considering the totality of the circumstances known to the officer, that the officer possessed reasonable
                            suspicion to justify the challenged seizure. State v. Nicholson, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 284</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 840 (2018).

                        <p>
                            Reasonable Suspicion for Continued Detention. - Detention after the identifications of the driver and defendant were returned was supported by reasonable suspicion and thus, did not violate the Fourth Amendment or N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 20, where defendant and another gave conflicting statements about the origin of their travel, the driver did not know their purported destination, and their choice of route seemed incongruous with the travel route.

                            Probable Cause to Arrest. - Inasmuch as the trial court's findings suggested the probability or substantial chance defendant engaged in criminal activity, the trial court did not err in concluding detectives had probable cause to arrest defendant. Thus,
                            detectives did not unconstitutionally interview defendant, or seize his clothing and DNA, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions to suppress. State v. Messer, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite>                            812, 806 S.E.2d 315 (2017).

                            Unreasonable Search Defined. - North Carolina has defined an unreasonable search as an examination or inspection without authority of law of one's premises or person with a view to the discovery of some evidence of guilt to be used in the prosecution
                            of a criminal action. State v. Turnbull, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 192 S.E.2d 689 (1972).

                            Except in certain cases, a search of private property without proper consent is "unreasonable" unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. State v. Frederick, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 230

                        <p>
                            The reasonableness of the search is in the first instance a substantive determination to be made by the trial court from the facts and circumstances of the case in the light of the criteria laid down by U.S. Const., Amend. IV and opinions which apply
                            that amendment. State v. Turnbull, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 192 S.E.2d 689 (1972).

                            Confession After Confrontation with Articles Obtained by Illegal Search. - Where a confession is obtained from defendant after he has been confronted with stolen property recovered from his home in an unlawful search without a warrant, the court must
                            find whether such confession was actually free and voluntary or whether it was triggered by the use of the articles obtained by the illegal search. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 559</cite>,

                            and since there is a specific grant of authority in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa11s15A-255" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-255</a></cite>.

                            Waiver. - By a voluntary waiver and consent to search, free from coercion, duress or fraud, and not given merely to avoid resistance, a defendant relinquishes the protection of U.S. Const., Amend. IV, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures,
                            and also relinquishes the protection given by this section against an unlawful search and seizure. State v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 234</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 61 (1967).

                            If one voluntarily permits or expressly invites and agrees to a search, being cognizant of his rights, such conduct amounts to a waiver of his constitutional protection. State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 295</cite>,

                            Evidence in License Revocation Hearing Not Subject to Exclusionary Rule. - Whether or not law enforcement officers had reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop a driver, the evidence that resulted from the stop was not subject to the exclusionary
                            rule; evidence in a license revocation hearing similarly is not subject to the exclusionary rule. Hartman v. Robertson, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 692, 703 S.E.2d 811 (2010).

                            Defendant Was Not Seized. - Trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to suppress on the ground that law enforcement did not have reasonable suspicion to stop her vehicle because she was not seized when she stopped her van in the middle of a road;
                            there was no evidence that defendant knew or reasonably believed the individuals in an unmarked pickup truck were law enforcement officers and no action on the part of law enforcement that caused her to stop her vehicle or
                            otherwise impede her movement. State v. Turnage, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 719, 817 S.E.2d 1, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 786</cite>, 821 S.E.2d 438, 2018 N.C.

                            Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because there was no action on the part of a police officer that caused defendant's vehicle to stop moving, or otherwise impede defendant's movement where the officer was dispatched to check the
                            status of a single car accident in a public vehicular area, and the mere activation of the officer's blue lights did not constitute a seizure. State v. Nunez, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 20, 2020).

                            Violation Shown. - Where seizure was a violation of defendant's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures, the evidence seized had to be suppressed. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite>                            114, 472 S.E.2d 169 (1996), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 633</cite>, 477 S.E.2d 45 (1998).

                            Trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the civil domestic violence protective order at issue only required defendant to surrender any weapons that he might have, the officers executing the order lacked probable cause to suspect
                            any particular criminal activity when they approached defendant's home, there were no exigent circumstances, and the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply to evidence obtained in violation of the state
                            constitution. State v. Elder, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 753 S.E.2d 504, review denied, 758 S.E.2d 863, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 417 (2014).

                            Defendant was seized because he was tailed by a marked police cruiser down empty streets at 3 a.m., followed into an empty parking lot, and then hailed down by the officer's hand gestures; a reasonable person would find such an empty, isolated location
                            at such a late time of night to be intimidating, and would be more susceptible to police pressure which he otherwise might have felt free to ignore in a sunlit, crowded location; additionally, the officer was uniformed, presumably
                            carrying a weapon, and was driving in his clearly-marked patrol vehicle. State v. Steele, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Jan. 20, 2021).

                            Motion to Suppress Properly Denied. - An anticipatory warrant to search the premises when an intercepted package containing contraband was delivered was properly executed where: (1) the warrant clearly established explicit triggering events on its face
                            which were definable and preordained; (2) although the package was no longer in the house when the search occurred, the package was delivered, accepted, and taken into the house by defendant; (3) the delivery of the package
                            linked the house to criminal activity inside, giving rise to probable cause for the search; and (4) the warrant specifically allowed the officers to search the premises to find and seize cocaine generally and to identify the
                            participants of the crime; thus, a trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the anticipatory search warrant. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite>                            382, 588 S.E.2d 497 (2003).

                            Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence in the trial of his charge of assault on a law enforcement officer because, even if the police officers' entry into defendant's home was unlawful, the exclusionary rule did not operate
                            to exclude evidence of defendant's assault on the law enforcement officers. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 616, 655 S.E.2d 860 (2008).

                            In a case in which defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for possession with intent to manufacture, sell and deliver a Schedule II controlled substance, he contended that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained
                            as a result of an unconstitutional search and seizure. An officer legitimately approached defendant's vehicle and detected the plain smell of marijuana as set forth in the Yates decision, and the plain smell of marijuana by
                            the officer provided sufficient probable cause to support a search and defendant's subsequent arrest. State v. Corpening, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 311, 683 S.E.2d 457 (2009).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a case in which defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for possession with intent to manufacture, sell and deliver a Schedule II controlled substance, he contended unsuccessfully that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress
                            evidence. Defendant's argument that the checkpoint was unconstitutional was inapplicable since he stopped solely of his own volition, rather than pursuant to any form of State action; because he parked 100 to 200 feet prior
                            to the checkpoint, the appellate court did not have to address (1) whether the checkpoint was valid, or (2) engage in an analysis concerning a traffic stop. State v. Corpening, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite>                            311, 683 S.E.2d 457 (2009).

                            No error was found in failing to suppress records of the location of defendant's cell phone because, inter alia, retrieval of the information was not a "search" requiring a warrant under the Fourth Amendment or N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            No error was found in failing to suppress records of the location of defendant's cell phone because, inter alia, the good-faith exception to the warrant requirement applied, as an officer relied on procedures in the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C.S.

                            Dog Sniff. - Trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress had to be vacated, as the judgment denying that motion was null and void because it was entered out of county, out of term, and out of session; as a result, the trial court had to hold
                            a new suppression hearing, and at that time the court could consider whether defendant's constitutional rights were violated by a police officer's dog sniff of defendant's vehicle while defendant was detained at a checkpoint
                            used to determine the validity of drivers' licenses and vehicle registrations, which led to the discovery that defendant possessed marijuana and cocaine. State v. Branch, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                            104, 627 S.E.2d 506 (2006).

                            Search Exceeded Scope of Consent. - Search of defendant's van, which included the officer's removal of a plastic wall panel, exceeded the scope of defendant's consent and thus, violated the Fourth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art. 1,

                            break-ins and vandalism because the officer did not have the reasonable suspicion necessary to allow a lawful traffic stop of defendant when defendant drove a silver car from the parking lot, without acknowledging the approaching

                            Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to suppress cocaine found in the trunk of a car defendant rented following a stop of the car for speeding because the trial court determined that a vehicle search by police officers was consensual; and
                            the police officers had a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity because defendant and the driver of the car gave conflicting stories, the driver avoided direct eye contact with a police officer, and the
                            back seat was full of personal belongings indicating that drugs might be in the trunk. These factors, coupled with the specific experience and training of the officers at the scene, gave rise to reasonable, articulable suspicion.

                            as to where contraband could be found in the vehicle justified the search under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, pursuant to U.S. Const., Amend. IV and N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Officers had a reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was involved in illegal activity when they stopped defendant's vehicle as: (1) an informant had told the police that defendant would be transporting cocaine that day and described the vehicle
                            and indicated that the informant had seen cocaine in defendant's possession; (2) a car matching the informant's description arrived at the designated location at the approximate time specified; (3) the informant confirmed that
                            the driver of the vehicle was defendant; and (4) the totality of the circumstances gave the officers a reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was transporting drugs, which gave the officers probable cause to arrest

                            properly found police had probable cause, questioning did not exceed permissible scope of the traffic stop, and detention of defendant was justified and not in violation of defendant's constitutional rights under this section.
                            The Supreme Court further declared subjective motives of police officer immaterial and upheld use of the objective. When rule standard to determine reasonableness of police action, related to probable cause, in view of constitutional

                            Drug Dog Sniff. - Where a drug dog sniff was conducted on defendant's vehicle during a traffic stop, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because (1) the officers needed no further justification in order to conduct the dog sniff since the
                            initial traffic stop was lawful, and (2) the dog sniff did not unreasonably prolong the detention. State v. Brimmer, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 653 S.E.2d 196 (2007).

                            Instinctive action by a police dog, unguided and undirected by the police, in nuzzling the opening of a garbage bag found in a closet of defendant's residence to reveal marijuana inside the bag, which brought evidence not otherwise in plain view into
                            plain view, was not a search within the meaning of constitutional law. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 702</cite>, 766 S.E.2d 289 (2014).

                            Search of Recent Passenger Based on Drug Dog Alert Improper. - Trial court's grant of defendant's motion to suppress was proper, because the drug dog's positive alert at the front side driver's door of a motor vehicle did not give rise to probable cause
                            to conduct a warrantless search of the person of a recent passenger. Without probable cause more particularized to defendant, the search of defendant, a passenger, violated the Fourth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Sobriety Checkpoint. - Order suppressing evidence obtained by roadway checkpoint was error because no evidence suggested that the stated proper purpose of checkpoint (sobriety) was a mask for another, unconstitutional purpose, and as such the trial court
                            was in error in holding that the lack of such evidence required it to exclude the evidence obtained by the stop; from the available evidence, it was clear that the actual purpose of the checkpoint was the same as its stated

                            that defendant was violating the law, and gave the officer reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle. State v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">366 N.C. 473</cite>, 749 S.E.2d 444 (2013).

                            Informant's tip was sufficiently reliable to justify an investigative stop of the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger, as well as a brief investigative detention of the vehicle's occupants, to search for weapons. State v. Sanchez,

                            Informant's tip had sufficient reliability and specificity to constitute reasonable suspicion to stop defendant as: (1) the chief of police had known the informant for 13 years, including as a child, and knew that the informant had provided previous information
                            about illegal drug activity that had yielded an arrest; (2) the tip did not have to be analyzed as an anonymous tip; (3) the basis for the informant's knowledge did not have to be proven under the totality of circumstances
                            test; and (4) the informant's tip provided specific information about defendant's future actions, including correctly predicting defendant's mode of transportation, defendant's destination, and defendant's time of arrival,
                            which, after it was corroborated by the police, sufficiently demonstrated that the informant had inside knowledge about the suspect, giving the police reasonable suspicion to believe the rest of the informant's tip. State v.

                            Improper Vehicle Stop. - Order granting defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained following a stop of his vehicle was proper because the movements of defendant's vehicle observed by the officer were nothing more than weaving, and the stop was illegal;
                            the officer saw no other signs of a high or low speed, no prolonged weaving, no improper turns, no inappropriate use of signals, and no other evidence of any type of improper or erratic driving. State v. Kochuk,

                            Length of Investigative Stop. - While the officer's initial use of handcuffs was reasonable because both defendant and his companion were acting aggressively and the officer was the only officer present, the length of defendant's detention might have
                            turned the investigatory stop into a de facto arrest, necessitating probable cause, however the trial judge failed to make findings on whether the extended detention was justified while the officer pursued his investigation

                            Suspicion of Impairment Held Reasonable. - Despite lack of an observed and verifiable traffic code violation by suspect, his driving 20 miles per hour below the speed limit and weaving within his lane were actions sufficient to raise a suspicion of an
                            impaired driver in a reasonable and experienced trooper's mind. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 386 S.E.2d 217 (1989), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 366</cite>,

                            Defendant's contention that the trial court should not have denied defendant's motion to suppress because the officer who stopped defendant's two-wheeled motorized vehicle did not have probable cause to make the stop had to be rejected; the officer was
                            only required to have reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle because the officer did not stop defendant's vehicle based on the traffic violation of operating an unregistered vehicle, which would have required probable
                            cause, but, instead, stopped the vehicle after observing defendant operate the vehicle in a manner that allowed the officer to reach the reasonable conclusion that defendant was driving the vehicle while defendant was impaired.

                            Trial court properly granted defendant's motion to suppress blood draw evidence a police officer collected from a nurse who was treating defendant because the officer did not advise defendant of his rights and did not obtain his written or oral consent
                            to the blood test; the State's post hoc actions did not overcome the presumption that the warrantless search was unreasonable, and it offended the Fourth Amendment and the State Constitution. State v. Romano,

                            Trial court properly granted defendant's motion to suppress blood draw evidence a police officer collected from a nurse because the record did not affirmatively show that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe defendant, who was unconscious during
                            the blood draw, committed the implied consent offense of driving while intoxicated; the record did not affirmatively show that defendant was intoxicated while he drove, but it raised a question as to whether defendant became
                            very intoxicated. State v. Romano, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 785 S.E.2d 168 (2016), modified and aff'd, 800 S.E.2d 644, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 398 (N.C. 2017).

                            Based on the United States Supreme Court's Fourth Amendment precedent regarding consent, the blood draw from defendant could not be justified under subsection (b) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a02s20-16.2" target="_blank">G.S. 20-16.2</a></cite>                            as a per se categorical exception to the warrant requirement; the implied-consent statute, as well as a person's decision to drive on public roads, are factors to consider when analyzing whether a suspect has consented to a
                            blood draw, but the statute alone does not create a per se exception to the warrant requirement. State v. Romano, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 678</cite>, 800 S.E.2d 644 (2017).

                            Trial court correctly suppressed defendant's blood sample because subsection (b) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a02s20-16.2" target="_blank">G.S. 20-16.2</a></cite> was unconstitutional as applied
                            to defendant since it permitted a warrantless search that violated the Fourth Amendment; blood draws could only be performed after obtaining a warrant, valid consent from the defendant, or under exigent circumstances with probable
                            cause, but the officer who took possession of defendant's blood did not get a warrant, and there were no exigent circumstances. State v. Romano, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 678</cite>, 800 S.E.2d 644 (2017).

                            the policy did not specify the "bodily specimen" employees were required to produce, the employees did not have a reduced expectation of privacy by virtue of their employment in a public school system, and the record was devoid

                            In a case in which defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to habitual impaired driving and appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress a blood test, the warrantless blood draw did not violate Article I of the North Carolina Constitution.

                            It was not error to deny defendant's motion to suppress the results of a nonconsensual, warrantless, blood draw because, when defendant refused an intoxilyzer test, exigent circumstances allowed the draw, considering the totality of the circumstances,

                            Reasonable Suspicion for Weapons Search. - Officer had reasonable suspicion to briefly search defendant for weapons during a traffic stop and the denial of defendant's motion to suppress was proper because the officer used his prior experience and training
                            to infer that the contents of defendant's right hand may have been a weapon and this inference went beyond unparticularized suspicion or hunch; because officers were allowed to take necessary steps to ensure their safety, the
                            officer acted reasonably when he asked to see what was in defendant's hand. Moreover, the officer was led to a reasonable suspicion because of defendant's (1) erratic answers, (2) evasive actions, (3) continued refusal to show
                            the officer the contents of his right fist, and (4) choice to raise his fist in a manner which led the officer to believe that defendant was about to strike him. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite>                            196, 678 S.E.2d 802 (2009).

                            Limitations on Pat-Down Search. - Although a police officer was justified in conducting a limited pat-down of the defendant to determine whether the defendant was armed, once the officer concluded that there was no weapon, he could not continue to search
                            or question the defendant in order to ascertain whether a rolled up plastic bag was contraband. State v. Beveridge, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 688, 436 S.E.2d 912 (1993), cert. denied,

                            Validity of Search Where Driver Not Charged with Offense. - Fact that driver was not charged thereafter with a DUI offense was not relevant to the trooper's initial suspicions; therefore, stop and search of car was valid. State v. Jones,

                            Results Not Suppressed Though State Line Crossed. - Neither the federal nor State Constitutions required that evidence of patrolman's detection of alcohol on defendant's breath and the results of a breathalyzer test given him by a Surry County deputy
                            sheriff be suppressed where the arresting officer did not know that defendant crossed the state line into Virginia before stopping his truck. State v.

                            No Legitimate Expectation of Privacy in Communal Dumpster. - Because communal dumpster was not within the curtilage of defendant, he retained no legitimate expectation of privacy in his garbage once he placed it in said dumpster, and the warrantless search
                            of the dumpster, resulting in charges of trafficking in cocaine, did not violate this section. State v. Washington, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 518 S.E.2d 14 (1999).

                            section, inasmuch as defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy regarding a conversation he voluntarily maintained with a confederate, did not violate defendant's right under N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Warrantless Strip Search Proper. - Because a reasonable person would have understood from the circumstances and exchanges between the officers and defendant that police intended to conduct a strip search of defendant's person, and she consented to the
                            strip search without withdrawing that consent at any time, the trial court properly denied her motion to suppress the evidence seized. State v. Neal, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 453,

                            Strip searches of defendant's person conducted incident to defendant's arrest were reasonable and did not violate N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Search Incident to Lawful Arrest. - Defendant's motion to suppress evidence of statements he made to deputies was properly denied because an informant's detailed information regarding a shooting was sufficiently corroborated by reliable and credible evidence,
                            which established probable cause to arrest defendant. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 253, 681 S.E.2d 460 (2009).

                            Cigarette Butts. - Defendant's cigarette butt was admissible because defendant abandoned the item in defendant's home's curtilage by giving the item to an officer who offered to dispose of the item, after defendant had been arrested, making the officers'
                            subjective intent in executing a valid arrest warrant, when the cigarette butt was seized, including any deception, irrelevant. State v. Borders, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 762

                            Officer's seizure of defendant's discarded cigarette butt from the parking lot near his apartment without a warrant did not violate his constitutional rights because the parking lot was not located in the curtilage of defendant's building, as it was not
                            enclosed, it was used for parking by both the building's residents and the general public, and it was only protected in a limited way. State v. Williford, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                            123, 767 S.E.2d 139 (2015).

                        <p>
                            Because defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the parking lot, by dropping the cigarette butt in the lot he was deemed to have abandoned any interest in it. Because defendant voluntarily abandoned the cigarette butt in a public place,
                            the extraction of his DNA from it did not constitute a search. State v. Williford, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 123, 767 S.E.2d 139 (2015).

                            Warrantless Search Upheld. - When officers saw liquid in containers generally used to contain and transport non-taxpaid liquor, under the circumstances then existing they had sufficient reasonable cause to believe that the jars contained non-taxpaid liquor
                            to justify the seizure of the contraband without a search warrant. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Supreme Court of North Carolina held that both the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in suppressing evidence seized during a warrantless search of defendant's automobile some 20 hours after an officer, who knew defendant and was familiar with
                            her vehicle, received information that the automobile contained several one-fourth ounce packages of marijuana; the search was not illegal, and the evidence seized should not have been suppressed. State v. Isleib,
                            <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 634</cite>, 356 S.E.2d 573 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence of alleged contraband that was seized from defendant, as the police officer's observance very early one morning of defendant's vehicle parked on the shoulder of a road near a mobile
                            home park into which another man had just fled gave the officer reasonable suspicion and justified the investigatory stop and detention of defendant; in addition, defendant's actions in "digging" through his glove compartment
                            and searching around the interior of the vehicle made the officer's subsequent pat-down search of defendant permissible, at which time the officer discovered the alleged contraband defendant was carrying. State v. Martinez,
                            <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 105, 580 S.E.2d 54, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 466</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 773 (2003).

                        <p>
                            It was not unreasonable for authorities to strip defendant and comb through his pubic without search warrant after arresting him for first degree sexual assault, kidnapping and sodomy. Arrest was supported by probable cause and evidence could easily have
                            been concealed or destroyed. State v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 660, 397 S.E.2d 647 (1990).

                        <p>
                            Where the search involved a motor vehicle in a public area, the only determination left for review was whether deputy had probable cause to search the van; the trial court found as facts that deputy was sufficiently experienced to make a reliable determination
                            that what he smelled was illegal contraband (white liquor), defendant appeared to deputy to be very nervous, and defendant had placed cardboard over a burned-out window on the van after a tire had caught fire; therefore deputy
                            had reasonable grounds to conclude that the van contained contraband, and that he did not need a warrant to search. State v. Corpening, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 427 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            There was reasonable suspicion to justify officer's search of defendant based on a telephone tip and the officer's observations of defendant. In re Whitley, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 290, 468 S.E.2d 610 (1996).

                            Where the incriminating evidence seized was immediately apparent to the officer, the cocaine was properly seized and admitted into evidence. In re Whitley, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 290, 468 S.E.2d 610 (1996).

                        <p>
                            The defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied where the detectives' prior knowledge of local drug activity, coupled with their 1:00 a.m. observations at the address as well as the circumstances surrounding defendant's actions, provided a sufficient
                            basis for those experienced law enforcement officers to draw a reasonable inference "that criminal activity was afoot," id., thus warranting the investigative stop. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite>                            590, 530 S.E.2d 297 (2000).

                        <p>
                            Where defendant's arrest was lawfully based on the fruits of a valid pat down search, the warrantless search of his person incident to the arrest, which yielded marijuana and crack cocaine, was likewise constitutional; the initial check point stop and
                            the driver's consent to the search of his vehicle provided sufficient constitutional justification for defendant's removal from the car, and the following facts supported the constitutionality of the pat down search: The long,
                            narrow bulge in defendant's front pants pocket, his belligerent attitude toward the detectives, his apparent intoxication, and the driver's claim that he did not know defendant's name. State v. Pulliam,
                            <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 437, 533 S.E.2d 280 (2000).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly concluded that a warrantless search conducted after a police officer and a detective entered a hotel room was not illegal where the detective had received information that the occupants of the room possessed drugs, the detective detected
                            and observed behavior by the room's occupants indicative of drug-related criminal activity, and scales similar to those often used by dealers to measure quantities of illegal narcotics were in plain view. State v. Harper,
                            <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 595, 582 S.E.2d 62, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 509</cite>, 588 S.E.2d 372 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress drugs obtained during a warrantless search of his car, as the drugs were found during a search incident to a lawful arrest supported by probable cause after verification of an informant's tip
                            as to the vehicle, the perpetrator, and the location and approximate time of the alleged drug activity. State v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 310, 585 S.E.2d 481 (2003), aff'd,

                            Evidence obtained in a warrantless search of defendant's vehicle was admissible where the officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to believe that defendant was committing an implied consent offense based on the facts that defendant's car was weaving
                            combined with the unusual hour and the location, in an area near bars, and the search of defendant's car was lawful based on the fact that it was admittedly consensual and not tainted by an unlawful detention. State v. Jacobs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 590 S.E.2d 437 (2004).

                            Where defendant was suspected of committing two sexual assaults and a third was reported in the area from which defendant was observed traveling at about 4:00 a.m., when it was snowing and no other vehicles were on the road, police had reasonable suspicion
                            of criminal activity allowing them to conduct an investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle, and defendant's expired license plate independently allowed the stop. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite>                            130, 595 S.E.2d 213, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 735</cite>, 603 S.E.2d 879 (2004).

                            Defendant's motion to suppress tangible evidence obtained when an officer chased him into a premises was properly denied because defendant's earlier presence in and accessibility to the premises was insufficient to establish the requisite privacy interest
                            for the Fourth Amendment. State v. McNeil, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 777, 600 S.E.2d 31 (2004).

                            Investigatory stop supported by evidence that defendant and another were observed loitering at a closed shopping center shortly before midnight wearing dark clothing in an area targeted by law enforcement officers as a high crime area, that no other vehicles
                            were in the shopping center parking lot, and that when a vehicle defendant recognized as a law enforcement vehicle appeared, the men abruptly and hurriedly returned to their vehicle, together with the other detailed findings
                            of fact articulated by the trial court, which adequately supported the officers' reasonable belief that defendant and the other man were involved in criminal activity. State v. Blackstock,

                            Defendant's conviction for second-degree murder was upheld on appeal, because defendant failed to show any prejudice with regard to the trial court's admission of a gun residue test over defendant's objection, because defendant did not object to the admission
                            of any statements made during the test, only the test results itself, and the trial court's finding that exigent circumstances existed was supported by the evidence in that the test had to have been administered within a few
                            hours of the shooting and defendant admitted he was one of the last to have seen the victim alive. State v. Page, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 127, 609 S.E.2d 432 (2005).

                            Police had reasonable suspicion that defendant was transporting drugs, and their warrantless stop of defendant's van was proper, where a confidential informant told police that defendant would be transporting drugs and defendant was seen by police driving
                            the van described by the informant along the suspected drug route; after the stop, defendant's consent for an officer to enter the van and the odor of cocaine smelled by the officer inside the van justified the officers' warrantless
                            search of the van. State v. Downing, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 790, 613 S.E.2d 35 (2005).

                            about the trip, provided law enforcement with the reasonable suspicion necessary to conduct the exterior canine sniff. State v. Euceda-Valle, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 268, 641 S.E.2d

                            Where an officer observed defendant drive over a curb, back away from the officer, and reach into a pocket in a location known for drug activity, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the officer had reasonable suspicion to make an
                            investigatory stop and had probable cause to seize a film canister from defendant's pocket during a pat-down for weapons based on, inter alia, defendant's actions, the area's reputation, and the officer's prior experiences.

                            Defendant's convictions for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, attempted first degree murder, and armed robbery were affirmed because the trial court did not err by denying defendant's suppression motion; since
                            neither the driver nor any of the passengers had a driver's license or other form of identification in their possession, the trooper could not quickly resolve the issues arising from the initial traffic stop. State v. Hernandez,

                            Stop of defendant's vehicle was reasonable despite the investigator's good faith mistake as to the identity of the driver because although the investigators did not personally observe defendant selling narcotics, the specific and articulable facts, as
                            well as the rational inferences from those facts, as viewed through the eyes of a reasonable, cautious officer, guided by his experience and training were sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was
                            afoot to justify a brief investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 703 S.E.2d 905, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 188</cite>,

                            Warrantless search did not violate defendant's rights, because the officer had probable cause to believe that evidence of criminal activity was located on defendant's person when he felt something hard between defendant's buttocks outside of defendant's
                            clothing, and the officer had observed various drug-related items in the vehicle in which defendant was riding and defendant made furtive movements toward his pants.

                            Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress as the officers warrantless entry into defendant's residence and arrest of defendant was proper because the officers had reasonable suspicion to initiate an investigatory stop of defendant
                            for driving while his license was revoked in front of defendant's residence; and the officers properly pursued defendant into his residence to arrest him for resisting a public officer when he did not obey their orders to stop
                            as the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for resisting a public officer and began a hot pursuit of defendant, which was one of the exigent circumstances delineated by the courts. State v. Adams,

                            that the undisputed facts and circumstances known to the police officer supported the conclusion that the officer had the requisite reasonable suspicion to justify a traffic stop of defendant's car, and that the trial court's
                            findings of fact supported this conclusion as well. State v. Evans, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 795 S.E.2d 444 (2017).

                            Defendant's right against an unconstitutional search and seizure was not violated when the officers searched defendant's shop as: (1) defendant's girlfriend, who had lived with him for 13 years, consented to the search; (2) the shop was located within
                            the curtilage of the house; (3) the officers had no reason to question the girlfriend's authority to consent to a search of the shop; and (4) the girlfriend's consent was voluntary. State v. Watkins,

                            Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence detectives seized during a search of an outbuilding that was within the curtilage of defendant's residence after he consented to a search of his property because defendant expressly
                            consented to a search of all of the personal or real property and did not contest that the outbuilding was located within the curtilage of his residence, and the search of the outbuilding was within the scope of consent; the
                            property included the interior of the mobile home and also outbuildings located within the curtilage of the residence, and defendant made no objection to the search of the outbuilding. State v. Hagin,

                            Reasonable Suspicion Found. - Officer had reasonable suspicion to approach defendant juvenile because defendant screamed an obscenity at him; while merely stating an obscenity to another individual, whether that person is a policeman or a civilian, may
                            be protected speech, an officer is not precluded from approaching any individual who is standing in public and yelling obscenities, as such actions might lead to a breach of the peace. In re V.C.R.,

                            suspicion that criminal activity was afoot; the court of appeals placed undue weight on the officer's subjective interpretation of the facts rather than focusing on how an objective, reasonable officer would have viewed them.

                            of the car in the ditch, the truck used to pull it out, or how many people were involved, and the details in the tip were not sufficient to even establish identifying characteristics, let alone to allow the deputy to corroborate

                            What Warrants are Prohibited. - Judicial warrants, general in terms and unsupported by preliminary oath or sworn evidence and for conduct not committed in the immediate presence of the magistrate, are forbidden by the federal Constitution and by this
                            section. Brewer v. Wynne, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 319</cite>, 79 S.E. 629, 1915B Ann. Cas. 319 (1913).

                            The general warrants against which this constitutional provision speaks did not specify items to be searched for or persons to be arrested, nor were they supported by showings of probable cause that any particular crime had been committed. State v. Richards,

                            This section proscribes warrants that empower officials to search for evidence of a particular offense without specifically naming the person against whom the offense is charged, the particular place to be searched or the items to be seized. Brooks v.

                            Anticipatory Warrant - Three requirements that must be observed before a search is executed pursuant to an anticipatory search warrant: (1) the anticipatory warrant must set out, on its face, explicit, clear, and narrowly drawn triggering events which
                            must occur before execution may take place; (2) those triggering events, from which probable cause arises, must be (a) ascertainable, and (b) preordained, meaning that the property is on a sure and irreversible course to its
                            destination; and finally, (3) no search may occur unless and until the property does, in fact, arrive at that destination. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 588 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            An anticipatory warrant to search the premises when an intercepted package containing contraband was delivered was properly executed where: (1) the warrant clearly established explicit triggering events on its face which were definable and preordained;
                            (2) although the package was no longer in the house when the search occurred, the package was delivered, accepted, and taken into the house by defendant; (3) the delivery of the package linked the house to criminal activity
                            inside, giving rise to probable cause for the search; and (4) the warrant specifically allowed the officers to search the premises to find and seize cocaine generally and to identify the participants of the crime; thus, a trial
                            court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the anticipatory search warrant. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 588 S.E.2d 497

                            the warrant was reliable and the information before a trial court was obtained in a reliable manner because the police were able to independently confirm a number of statements the informant made, and the trial court had information
                            before it as to the informant's year-long history of purchasing drugs from defendant, as well as police officers' testimony that they considered the information reliable; (2) the warrant contained clear triggering events; (3)
                            the triggering events were ascertainable and preordained; and (4) no search could have taken place until after those triggering events occurred. State v.

    Spinelli
   </i> - veracity and basis of knowledge - are still relevant, but are not to be accorded independent status. The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances
                            set forth in the affidavit before him, including the "veracity" and "basis of knowledge" of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular
                            place. And the duty of the reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. State v. Arrington, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 633</cite>, 319 S.E.2d

                            Particular Description of Things to Be Seized Required. - The requirement that warrants shall particularly describe the things to be seized is to prevent the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another and to leave nothing to the discretion
                            of the officer executing the warrant in determining what is to be taken. State v. Foye, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 200, 188 S.E.2d 67 (1972).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Description of Books. - The particularity requirement is to be accorded the most scrupulous exactitude when the things to be seized are books and the basis for the seizure is the ideas which they contain. When First Amendment rights are not involved,
                            the specificity requirement is more flexible. State v. Foye, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 200, 188 S.E.2d 67 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Description of Narcotics. - The words "illegally held narcotic drugs" described the things to be seized with sufficient particularity to prevent the warrant from being a general search warrant within the prohibition of U.S. Const., Amend. IV and this
                            section. State v. Shirley, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 440, 183 S.E.2d 880, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 729</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 885 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The description in the search warrant was particular enough to prevent the warrant from being a general search warrant within the prohibition of U.S. Const., Amend. IV and this section where the affidavit upon which it was based referred only to "narcotic
                            drugs, the possession of which is a crime" and did not describe the things to be seized with more particularity. State v. Foye, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 200, 188 S.E.2d 67 (1972).

                            Incorporation of Affidavit. - Where an affidavit complied with the provisions of the applicable statute and met the constitutional standard of reasonableness and probable cause requisite to the issuance of a search warrant, the search warrant, by reference
                            to the affidavit, which was made a part of the warrant, described with reasonable certainty the premises to be searched, sufficiently indicated the basis for the finding of probable cause, and sufficiently described the contraband
                            for which the search was to be conducted. State v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 420, 190 S.E.2d 361 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Affidavit Sufficient to Find Probable Cause. - Affidavit stating that a confidential informant (CI) bought cocaine from defendant at defendant's house, that the officer knew and trusted the CI, that the CI made a controlled buy from defendant after meeting
                            with the officer, and that the officer witnessed several hand-to-hand transactions between defendant and visitors to defendant's house, provided probable cause to support the issuance of the search warrant. State v. Stokley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 646 S.E.2d 640 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 243</cite>, 660 S.E.2d 542 (2008).

                        <p>
                            Police officer's affidavit, based on information from an informant the officer had known for years, was sufficient for the issuance of a search warrant under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa11s15A-244" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-244</a></cite>                            because under the totality of the circumstances the affidavit provided a magistrate with probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant for defendant's home under U.S. Const., Amend. IV and N.C. Const., Art. I,

                        <p>
                            In a case in which defendant pled guilty to violating, inter alia, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a05s90-95ol1d3" target="_blank">G.S. 90-95(d)(3)</a></cite> and (a)(1), 90-113.22, and 90-108(a)(7),
                            he argued unsuccessfully that there was not a nexus between the presence of drugs in his storage unit and the existence of drugs at his house to provide the requisite probable cause for the search warrant of his residence.
                            There was sufficient evidence offered in support of the search warrant for defendant's residence to provide probable cause to believe that contraband would be found in that location, and, given the circumstances of the case,
                            there was no reason to doubt the informant's reliability and basis of knowledge. State v. Washburn, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 685 S.E.2d 555 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 811</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Magistrate had a substantial basis to find that probable cause existed to issue the challenged search warrant, where the affidavit stated that, based on the amount of marijuana found in a car the detective stopped, the occupants appeared to be drug dealers,
                            drug dealers typically keep evidence of drug dealing in their homes, the mother of one of the car's occupants stated that her son lived at defendant's address, and her description of the premises matched the actual premises.
                            State v. Allman, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 292</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 301 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Search warrant was supported by probable cause as required by the Fourth Amendment and this section, as the affidavit listed the officer's training and experience, provided defendant's history of drug-related arrests, and stated that the detective had
                            discovered marijuana residue in the trash from defendant's residence, along with correspondence addressed to defendant. State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 360</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 282 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained in a search of defendant's residence was appropriate because, based on an affiant detective's training and experience, the conduct of a middleman in meeting and traveling with a confidential informant
                            to defendant's residence and in entering and returning from the residence in controlled buys by the informant, and the detective's personal observations, a magistrate had a substantial basis to find probable cause existed to
                            believe controlled substances were located at the residence. State v. Frederick, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 165, 814 S.E.2d 855, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 547</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Warrant for the search of a residence was supported by probable cause where the officer's knowledge of a controlled purchase of crack cocaine and her credibility determination of the confidential informant based on previously working with that informant
                            rendered the affidavit sufficient under the totality of the circumstances test. State v. Caddell, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 400 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Probable cause existed to support the issuance of a search warrant for defendant's residence because the warrant was issued based on information contained in a law enforcement officer's affidavit relating to the sale of illegal drugs at another location
                            earlier that day by other residents of the home so as to provide a nexus between the residence and suspected criminal activity. The information set out in the affidavit allowed the magistrate to infer that evidence related
                            to the criminal activity was likely to be found at the residence. State v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 332</cite>, 841 S.E.2d 277 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the application to obtain defendant's cell-site location information contained all the information necessary from which the trial court could have issued a warrant supported by
                            probable cause, and in fact, the trial court in its order specifically found that probable cause existed to obtain this information. State v. Gore, - N.C. App. - , 846 S.E.2d 295 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Affidavit Insufficient to Find Probable Cause. - Where the affidavit contained a mere naked assertion that the informant at some time saw a "room full of marijuana" growing in the defendant's house, and the officer affiant made no attempt to corroborate
                            the informant's story, but merely verified that the defendant lived in the house in question, the affidavit did not contain sufficient information on which to find probable cause, nor could the evidence seized as a result of
                            the search be admitted under the "good faith exception" to the exclusionary rule in view of the fact that the officer took no reasonable steps to comply with U.S. Const., Amend. IV. State v. Newcomb,
                            <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 351 S.E.2d 565 (1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant was properly suppressed because, inter alia, the affidavit supporting the search warrant merely stated that the confidential informant had visited the described location and made controlled purchases of cocaine
                            at the location, without particularly stating which, if any, of the two dwellings the informant entered to make the purchases. In addition, the special agent had only been working in law enforcement for two years at the time
                            the agent applied for the search warrant, and failed to include facts regarding whether the agent observed the transactions between the confidential informant and the seller, thereby failing to establish the identity of the
                            seller as defendant. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 587, 664 S.E.2d 421 (2008).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Affidavit was not sufficient to support a finding of probable cause, because the affiadavit contained false information, including a statement that a new information had proven reliable in the past, when the officer's testimony clearly showed that he
                            had not had any sort of prior relationship with the informant and knew little or nothing about him. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 727 S.E.2d 322 (2012).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under the totality of the circumstances, the search warrant affidavit for defendant's home failed to provide a substantial basis for the magistrate to conclude that probable cause existed, and therefore the appellate court properly affirmed the trial
                            court's order granting defendant's motion to suppress, because the officers' verification of mundane information, a detective's statements regarding defendant's utility records, and the officers' observations of defendant's
                            gardening supplies were not sufficiently corroborative of the anonymous tip of an indoor marijuana growing operation or otherwise sufficient to establish probable, notwithstanding the officers' professional training and experience.
                            State v. Benters, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 660</cite>, 766 S.E.2d 593 (2014).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Detective's affidavit did not allege sufficient facts to support the existence of probable cause to search defendant's residence, which she shared with her boyfriend and his brother, where the circumstances in the affidavit that the boyfriend and his
                            brother were engaged in drug dealing and had lied to officers about where they lived were insufficient to establish probable cause that evidence of illegal activity existed at the residence. State v. Allman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 685, 781 S.E.2d 311, rev'd on other grounds, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 1114 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the special agent did not act in bad faith when she submitted her application for a search warrant and attached the affidavit for determination of probable cause, the affidavit failed to establish the required nexus between the object sought, evidence
                            of a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory, and the place to be searched, as there was no evidence that the place alleged was defendant's residence or that any subject objects were there. State v. Parson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 791 S.E.2d 528 (2016).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress where the supporting affidavit provided no indication as to when the alleged criminal activities occurred, and since the affidavit was invalid, any evidence obtained as a result of the search
                            warrant was erroneously admitted at trial; the supporting affidavit to the search warrant application was completely devoid of any indication as to when the events used to establish probable cause occurred. State v. Logan,
                            - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 6, 2021).

                        <p>
                            Affidavit in support of a search warrant application did not provide sufficient facts from which the magistrate could conclude there was probable cause because it did not specify when the purported events occurred nor did it indicate sufficient facts
                            from which the magistrate could reasonably infer the timing of such events; therefore, the search warrant obtained as a result of the affidavit was invalid and resulted in an unreasonable search and seizure. State v. Logan,
                            - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 6, 2021).

                            Production of Search Warrant. - Where a search is made under conditions requiring the issuance of a search warrant, and the State attempts, over objection, to justify the search and seizure by the possession of a valid search warrant, the State must produce
                            the search warrant, or if it has been lost, must prove such fact and then introduce evidence to show its contents and regularity on its face, unless the production of the warrant is waived by the accused. State v. McMilliam,

                            authorize a general exploratory search of defendant's home and inventory of its contents. State v. Connard, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 344 S.E.2d 568 (1986), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 392</cite>,

                            Blood Sample Taken Without Consent or Search Warrant Unconstitutional. - Where defendant was already in custody, obtaining a sample of his blood pursuant to a nontestimonial identification order under Article 14 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 15A</a></cite>                            (G.S. 15A-271, et seq.), absent his consent or a search warrant, violated his rights under this section to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and the evidence should have been suppressed.

                        <p>
                            While defendant was an overnight guest in the premises searched pursuant to a search warrant, he did not show that he personally had an expectation of privacy there, or that such an expectation was reasonable; therefore, he had no standing to object to
                            the search of the premises. State v. Sanchez, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 556 S.E.2d 602 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 220</cite>, 560 S.E.2d 358 (2002).

                            When, after a proper investigatory stop and protective search of defendant's vehicle, money, gloves and headgear from rapes and robberies he had committed were observed in plain view, a magistrate had probable cause to issue warrants to search defendant's

                            Affidavit Sufficient to Support Finding of Probable Cause Despite Alleged False Statements Contained Therein. - Affidavit containing allegedly false statements was not invalid where other statements supported finding of probable cause; among other things,
                            the unchallenged statements showed that 20 different sources complained to police about criminal activity at the subject residence and a confidential informant made a controlled buy of cocaine at the residence. State v. Boyd,

                            Stop of Vehicle After Defendant Turned Away Just Prior to Checkpoint. - Denial of motion to suppress was upheld as totality of circumstances justified officer's pursuing and stopping defendant's vehicle to inquire as to why defendant turned away before
                            checkpoint. In addition to the fact of defendant's legal turn immediately prior to the checkpoint, the following facts combined to allow the officer to make a reasonable inquiry to determine whether defendant was trying to
                            evade the checkpoint: (1) the late hour; (2) the sudden braking of the truck when defendant crested the hill and could see the checkpoint, to the point that the headlights dipped as the front of the truck dove towards the street;
                            (3) the abruptness of defendant's turn into the nearest apartment parking lot; and (4) defendant's behavior in first backing the truck into one space, pulling out and proceeding towards the parking lot exit, and then re-parking
                            when he spotted the patrol car approaching him. State v. Bowden, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 718, 630 S.E.2d 208 (2006).

                        <p>
                            Sufficient Evidence to Support Reasonable Cause. - Sufficient evidence supported a reasonable cause to believe a search of a residence would produce contraband evidence of defendant's criminal activity. Because of the history and apparent continuous nature
                            of defendant's counterfeit trademark business, evidence that occurred twenty months prior to the execution of the search warrant was not so far removed to be considered stale as a matter of law. State v. Howard,
                            <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 848, 817 S.E.2d 232 (2018).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evidence Sufficient to Support Stop When Not Free to Leave. - When a deputy turned the deputy's vehicle around and activated the deputy's blue lights after arrival upon the scene and then the defendant stopped walking and voluntarily talked with the deputy,
                            and when the defendant failed to provide a photo identification to the deputy, but provided the defendant's name and address this encounter was properly classified as a stop. The State does not contest that the defendant was
                            seized to implicate the Fourth Amendment or this constitutional provision. A reasonable person would not have felt at liberty to ignore the deputy's presence and the use of blue lights on the deputy's marked vehicle, and continue
                            to walk away. State v. Hester, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 803 S.E.2d 8 (2017).

                        No Claim Exists under this Section Where a Different State Remedy Was Available. - Summary judgment was proper in favor of the defendant city on each of plaintiff's state constitutional claims arising under this section and Art. I,

                    <p>
                        It was not error to grant summary judgment in favor of a police officer and a city, as to a citizen's claims under N.C. Const. art. I,
                        <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span> 19, 20, 21, and 35, based on the officer's alleged use of excessive force, because the fact that the citizen had to overcome the affirmative defense of public officer immunity to succeed on the citizen's tort claims
                        did not negate the claims' adequacy as a remedy, so a direct cause of action under the North Carolina Constitution was not permitted. Debaun v. Kuszaj, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 767 S.E.2d 353 (2014).

                        Search and Seizure. - Where an officer observed defendant drive over a curb, back away from the officer, and reach into a pocket in a location known for drug activity, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the officer had reasonable
                        suspicion to make an investigatory stop and had probable cause to seize a film canister from defendant's pocket during a pat-down for weapons based on, inter alia, defendant's actions, the area's reputation, and the officer's prior
                        experiences. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 658 S.E.2d 501 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Habeas Petitions. - Ordering two habeas petitioners' release was error where they were held due to an immigration-related process by a sheriff who was a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government. Thus, the court's state law authority to
                        inquire into the lawfulness of petitioners' detentions had been superseded by federal law. Although the trial court had authority to make an initial determination as to its authority, an examination of the applications themselves
                        should have led it to summarily deny the habeas corpus petitions. Chavez v. McFadden, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 458</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 139 (2020).

                        While a trial judge presented with an application for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus has the authority to determine whether it is entitled to act upon any such petition, it should (1) summarily deny an application seeking the issuance of a writ
                        of habeas corpus that alleges that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer by a sheriff who is a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government and (2) deny a petitioner's
                        request for discharge in the event that the return filed by a sheriff who has entered into a 287(g) agreement with the federal government claims that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant
                        or detainer. Chavez v. McFadden, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 458</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 139 (2020).

                        Statute Prescribing Inmate Grievance Procedures Upheld. - Former G.S. 148-113, requiring an inmate to exhaust his administrative remedies before he is entitled to judicial review of a grievance or complaint within the jurisdiction of the Inmate Grievance
                        Commission, did not conflict with constitutional and statutory provisions guaranteeing the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, since former G.S. 148-113 only prescribed the method by which the inquiry into the lawfulness of
                        an inmate's detention is to be conducted. Hoffman v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 269 S.E.2d 311 (1980).

                        superintendents of the several State hospitals that he is sane and safe. Such a condition deprives the court of any exercise of judicial discretion and nullifies its power to release an inmate being illegally detained in a mental

                        The principles of this section are dear to every free man; they are his shield and buckler against wrong and oppression, and lie at the foundation of civil liberty. They are declared to be the rights of the citizens of North Carolina and ought to be vigilantly
                        guarded. State v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. 66</cite> (1854); State v. Snipes, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 743</cite>, 117 S.E. 500 (1923).

                    <p>
                        "Indictment". - The word "indictment" means indictment by a grand jury as defined by the common law. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 439</cite>, 163 S.E. 581 (1932).

                    <p>
                        The term "indictment" is used in this section to signify a written accusation of a crime drawn up by the public prosecuting attorney and submitted to the grand jury, and by them found and presented on oath or affirmation as a true bill. State v. Thomas,
                        <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283 (1952).

                        It is an essential of jurisdiction that a criminal offense should be sufficiently charged in a warrant or an indictment. State v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 409</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 770 (1968).

                    <p>
                        A valid indictment is a condition precedent to jurisdiction of the superior court to determine the guilt or innocence of a defendant and to the authority of the court to render a valid judgment in the matter. State v. Yoes,
                        <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967); State v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 409</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 770 (1968); State v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 556</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 457 (1968).

                    <p>
                        This section requires a bill of indictment, unless waived, for all criminal actions originating in the superior court, and a valid bill is necessary to vest the court with authority to determine the question of guilt or innocence. State v. Bissette,
                        <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 514</cite>, 108 S.E.2d 858 (1959).

                    <p>
                        A valid indictment is essential to the jurisdiction of the court in a criminal case. State v. Crabtree, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 541</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 103 (1975); State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                        583, 335 S.E.2d 770 (1985).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a criminal prosecution where no presentment or impeachment is involved and no waiver of indictment has been made, a valid bill of indictment is essential to the jurisdiction of the court to try defendant for a felony. State v. Simpson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 613</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 361 (1981).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Order denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence was void because the trial court was without jurisdiction to entertain and rule upon the motion as defendant had not been indicted or waived indictment at the time of the hearing. State v. Wolfe,
                        <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 581 S.E.2d 117 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Remand for re-sentencing on felony child abuse inflicting serious physical injury was improper because the indictment failed to allege an essential element required for proof of that crime: that injury be inflicted by a parent or any other person providing
                        care to or supervision of a child less than 16 years of age; however, the indictment and jury verdict did support a conviction for class A1 misdemeanor assault. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite>                        732, 632 S.E.2d 516 (2006).

                        One charged with a capital felony may only be prosecuted on an indictment found by a grand jury. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283 (1952).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        When Indictments are Not Required. - The provisions of this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
                        <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 24, when read together, empower the legislature to provide means other than indictments by grand juries for the trial of petty misdemeanors, with the right of appeal. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>,
                        73 S.E.2d 283 (1952); State v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 68</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 461 (1956).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The constitutional requirement that criminal trials must be upon a bill of indictment is subject to two exceptions: (1) the legislature may provide means other than indictments by grand juries for the trial of petty misdemeanors; and (2) when represented
                        by counsel, an accused may, in all except capital cases, waive indictment under rules prescribed by the legislature. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 364</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 521 (1965).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        District court had jurisdiction to try defendant for operating a motor vehicle with an open container of alcohol while alcohol remained in defendant's system because the citation issued to defendant identified the crime and stated defendant had an open
                        container of alcohol after drinking, (2) defendant filed no motion objecting to the sufficiency of the offense charged in the citation, and (3) any failure to allege facts supporting every element of the offense was not a jurisdictional
                        defect, as the North Carolina Constitution required no grand jury to make a probable cause determination for misdemeanors tried in district court as a jurisdictional prerequisite. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite>                        364, 805 S.E.2d 701 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 548</cite>, 819 S.E.2d 340, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 911 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was error to affirm a decision upholding an order granting defendant's motion to dismiss because a citation issued for driving while subject to an impairing substance tolled the statute of limitations, and the citation was a constitutionally and statutorily
                        proper criminal pleading that conveyed jurisdiction to the district court to try defendant; because a citation could serve as the charging document for misdemeanors, the purpose of the statute of limitations was satisfied by its
                        issuance. State v. Curtis, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 355</cite>, 817 S.E.2d 187 (2018).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Indictment on Appeal to Superior Court. - Until the legislature prescribes regulations governing waiver of an indictment in a case heard in superior court on an appeal from an inferior court, an accused in such a case may not waive indictment and be tried
                        upon an information. State v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 169 S.E.2d 32 (1969).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Superior court prosecution violated defendant's Constitutional right because due to the State's improper prosecution in superior court, defendant had to appear in that court to seek dismissal of the prosecution and had to appear before the court of appeals
                        following the State's appeal. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 822 S.E.2d 902 (2018).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        When Trial on Appeal in Superior Court May Be Upon Original Accusation. - Where the General Assembly declares an offense below the grade of felony to be a petty misdemeanor and provides for prosecution of such offense in an inferior court upon accusation
                        other than indictment, and confers upon such inferior court final jurisdiction of such prosecutions subject to the right of appeal to the superior court, the defendant on appeal from conviction in the inferior court may be tried
                        in the superior court upon the original accusation without an indictment; but when there has been no trial in the inferior court, and the prosecution has merely been transferred to the superior court upon defendant's demand for
                        jury trial, trial in the superior court upon the original warrant is a nullity, and a statute providing for such trial is unconstitutional. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73
                        S.E.2d 283 (1952).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A defendant convicted in a recorder's court having final jurisdiction of the offense charged could be tried in the superior court on appeal upon the original warrant without an indictment. State v. Doughtie, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 228</cite>,
                        77 S.E.2d 642 (1953).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The superior court has no jurisdiction to try an accused for a specific misdemeanor on the warrant of an inferior court unless he is first tried and convicted for such misdemeanor in the inferior court and appeals to the superior court from the sentence
                        pronounced against him by the inferior court on his conviction for such misdemeanor. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 109</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 189 (1954); State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 596</cite>,
                        99 S.E.2d 764 (1957); State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 185</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 355 (1957); State v. Guffey, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 94</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 827 (1973); State v. Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite>                        723, 205 S.E.2d 322 (1974).

                    <p>
                        Waiver of Indictment in Non-Capital Cases. - One charged with a noncapital felony or with a misdemeanor may be tried initially in the superior court only upon an indictment, except when he is represented by counsel he may be tried upon information signed
                        by the prosecuting attorney when written waiver of indictment by defendant and his counsel appears on the face of the information. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283
                        (1952).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A person charged with the commission of a misdemeanor cannot be tried initially in the superior court except upon an indictment found by a grand jury, unless he waives indictment in accordance with regulations prescribed by the legislature. State v. Norman,
                        <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 205</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 602 (1953).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By virtue of this section an accused in a criminal proceeding, when represented by counsel, may, in all except capital cases, waive indictment under rules prescribed by the legislature. State v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                        622, 169 S.E.2d 32 (1969).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's order denying defendant's motion for appropriate relief was reversed where there was no formal waiver signed by both defendant and his counsel on or attached to the bill of information meeting the statutory requirements of
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsVIa32s15A-642ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-642(c)</a></cite>, and thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to accept defendant's guilty plea and enter the original
                        judgment. State v. Nixon, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 676, 823 S.E.2d 689 (2019).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Substantial Alteration of Indictment. - In a case in which defendant appealed her conviction for negligent child abuse, the appellate court concluded that the trial court committed reversible error during the trial by permitting the State to amend the
                        indictment. The amendment, which constituted a substantial alteration, allowed the jury to convict defendant of conduct not alleged in the original indictment and found by the grand jury. State v. Frazier,
                        <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 840, 795 S.E.2d 654, review denied, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 317 (2017).

                    <p>
                        An indictment must clearly and positively identify the person charged with the commission of the offense; omission of the name of the defendant, or a sufficient description if his name is unknown, in the body of the indictment, is a fatal and incurable
                        defect. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 613</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 361 (1981).

                    <p>
                        All Essential Elements of Offense Must Be Charged. - An indictment, whether at common law or under a statute, to be good must allege lucidly and accurately all the essential elements of the offense endeavored to be charged. State v. Stokes,
                        <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 409</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 770 (1968).

                    <p>
                        All of the essential elements of the offense must be alleged in an indictment charging a statutory offense. State v. Crabtree, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 541</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 103 (1975); State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                        583, 335 S.E.2d 770 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Short Form Murder Indictment Lacking Elements of Premeditation and Deliberation Upheld. - The court rejected the defendant's argument that because the indictment failed to allege two essential elements of first degree murder, i.e., premeditation and deliberation,
                        his conviction of first degree murder based thereon violated Article I,
                        <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span> 19, 22 and 23 of the North Carolina Constitution. The court found that the defendant had adequate notice of the charge against him, as North Carolina has for nearly 100 years authorized the use of the short form murder
                        indictment as sufficient to allege the elements of premeditation and deliberation, and the jury was properly required to find those elements beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Holder, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite>                        89, 530 S.E.2d 562 (2000).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An indictment is constitutionally sufficient if it apprises defendant of the charge against him with enough certainty to enable him to prepare his defense and to protect him from subsequent prosecution for the same offense. The indictment must also enable
                        the court to know what judgment to pronounce in case of conviction. State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 596</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 878 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If an indictment charges the offense in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner and contains averments sufficient to enable the court to proceed to judgment, and to bar a subsequent prosecution for the same offense, it is sufficient. State v. Norwood,
                        <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).

                    <p>
                        Offenses Which Indictment Will Support. - Remand for sentencing and entry of judgment for attempted voluntary manslaughter was appropriate because, although the indictment against defendant for attempted first-degree murder failed to include the essential
                        element of malice aforethought, the jury's guilty verdict of attempted first-degree murder necessarily meant that they found all of the elements of the lesser-included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter. State v. Wilson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 762 S.E.2d 894 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Use of Statutory Language. - An indictment for a statutory offense is sufficient as a general rule when it charges the offense in the language of the statute. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d
                        253 (1976).

                    <p>
                        Aggravating Circumstances for the Death Penalty. - Heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXVa100s15A-2000ol1e9" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-2000(e)(9)</a></cite>                        was argued to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that that vagueness could not be cured through appellate narrowing after Ring; although the issue was not raised in the lower court so as to be properly addressed on
                        appeal, the highest court found the issue to be in the public interest, addressed the issue to further develop its jurisprudence under N.C. R. App. P. 2, and determined that the circumstance was constitutional under the Sixth Amendment
                        because (1) the pattern jury instructions included language approved by the Court that narrowed the definition of the circumstance, and (2) the appellate review of the circumstance as submitted to the jury did not make the appellate
                        court a "co-finder of fact" with the jury. State v. Duke, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 110</cite>, 623 S.E.2d 11 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Aggravating Circumstances of Capital Offense Need Not Be Alleged. - The defendant's murder indictment complied with the requirements of this section and did not violate his constitutional rights; because defendant had notice that he was charged with first
                        degree murder and the elements thereof, as well as his eligibility for the death penalty, the State was not required to allege the supporting aggravating circumstances. State v. Holman, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 174</cite>,

                        No Requirement to Instruct Indicting Grand Jury on Elements of Crime. - A court is not required to instruct the indicting grand jury on the elements of the crime in question. State v. Treadwell, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite>                        769, 394 S.E.2d 245 (1990).

                        An indictment returned by a grand jury not legally constituted is not a valid indictment. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967); State v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 556</cite>,

                        Dismissal When Indictment Is Invalid. - When the indictment charging defendant with the commission of crime is invalid, defendant's motion to dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction should be allowed. State v. Beasley,
                        <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 318</cite>, 180 S.E. 598 (1935).

                    <p>
                        While defendant abandoned error as to one of the six challenged indictments filed against him, each alleging charges of first-degree sexual offense, the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the remaining five upon defendant's motion as fatally defective,
                        given that they erroneously charged two similar but distinct crimes and effectively charged neither. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 647 S.E.2d 475 (2007), rev'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 169</cite>,

                        Where Proceedings Are Invalid. - This section means action by the grand jury according to the practice at common law, and does not permit open hearings before the grand jury. Thus, where the court sent for the grand jury and permitted the solicitor to
                        examine a State's witness in open court before the grand jury, after the grand jury had returned two identical bills of indictment against the defendant, submitted on successive days, "not a true bill," and thereafter the solicitor
                        submitted another identical bill to the grand jury which was returned "a true bill," defendant's verified plea in abatement and motion to quash, made before pleading, should have been allowed, and upon appeal from the court's denial
                        of the motion the judgment would be reversed, with leave to the solicitor to send another bill before a different grand jury, if so advised. State v. Ledford, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 724</cite>, 166

                    <p>
                        Where defendant was tried at a special term of criminal court upon an indictment returned by a grand jury drawn for the special term, but there was no order by the Governor that a grand jury be drawn for such term as provided by former G.S. 7-78, defendant's
                        motion in arrest of judgment, made for the first time in the Supreme Court upon appeal, would be allowed pursuant to this section. State v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 90</cite>, 179 S.E. 450

                        It is competent to send as many bills of indictment as may be necessary to the grand jury to get before them necessary witnesses and evidence from which they may decide the propriety of submitting the accused to trial. State v. Lewis,

                        Assault with Deadly Weapon. - A justice of the peace had no jurisdiction of an assault with a deadly weapon except to bind the defendant over, and by the provisions of this section, the superior court could proceed to trial only upon indictment duly found
                        and returned. State v. Myrick, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 688</cite>, 163 S.E. 803 (1932). See also, State v. Clegg, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 675</cite>, 200 S.E. 371 (1939).

                        Attempted Murder Indictment. - Where defendant's indictment for attempted first degree murder was deficient, under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                        <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 22 and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html#t15a15s15-144" target="_blank">G.S. 15-144</a></cite>, because it omitted phrase "and of his malice aforethought," the appellate court, after defendant was
                        convicted by a jury of attempted first degree murder, arrested the judgment and remanded the matter for sentencing and the entry of judgment for attempted voluntary manslaughter, which the indictment supported; the failure of the
                        criminal pleading to charge the essential elements of the stated offense was an error of law that could be corrected upon appellate review even though no corresponding objection, exception, or motion was made in the trial division.
                        State v. Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 574 S.E.2d 17, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 64</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 396, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 928, 124 S. Ct. 338, 157 L. Ed. 2d 231 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Where the original indictment charging defendant with attempted first-degree murder was constitutionally and statutorily sufficient to provide jurisdiction, allege attempted voluntary manslaughter, and was not fatally defective, no manifest necessity
                        existed to declare a mistrial over defendant's objections, the State was barred from re-indicting defendant on attempted murder or manslaughter and the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the subsequent indictment.
                        Therefore, defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated by his subsequent indictment, prosecution, trial, and conviction of attempted first-degree murder. State v. Schalow, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite>                        334, 795 S.E.2d 567 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Short-form indictment was sufficient to vest the trial court with subject-matter jurisdiction over the attempted first-degree murder charge because the prosecution properly included the legal element of malice aforethought; and, despite the usage of the
                        term "slay" instead of the term "murder," the short-form indictment provided such certainty in the statement of the accusation as would identify the offense with which defendant was charged. State v. Tart,
                        <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 73</cite>, 824 S.E.2d 837 (2019).

                        Kidnapping. - An indictment charging that defendant "unlawfully, did feloniously and forcibly kidnap" a person named was not defective for failure to charge additionally that the victim was forcibly carried away against her will. State v. Norwood,
                        <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).

                        Motion to Suppress Properly Denied. - Because defendant's initial seizure and incarceration were not unconstitutional, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized from defendant's person. State v. Hocutt,

                            prior experiences. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 658 S.E.2d 501 (2008).

                            In a case in which the trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress finding that his arrest was illegal and as such was a violation of his right to be free from unreasonable seizures, the State appealed, arguing successfully that the trial court
                            erred in basing its decision on whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave during the interaction, rather than determining whether there existed special circumstances which would justify a law enforcement officer's
                            actions, and whether those actions were the least intrusive means of carrying out the purpose of the stop. The trial court had to determine whether special circumstances existed that would have justified the officer's use of
                            handcuffs such that they remained the least intrusive means reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of the stop. State v. Carrouthers, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 683 S.E.2d

                            Private Counsel May Assist Prosecuting Attorney. - The trial court has discretionary power to allow private counsel to assist the prosecuting attorney in the trial of a case, it being the duty of the court to permit only such assistance as fairness and
                            justice may require, and such power does not impinge on the provisions of this section. State v. Carden, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 404</cite>, 183 S.E. 898, cert. denied, 298 U.S. 682, 56 S.

                            Prejudicial Argument. - In a capital case, any argument made by the prosecuting attorney or by private prosecution appearing for the State which suggests to the jury that they can depend upon either judicial or executive review to correct any errors in
                            their verdict and to share their responsibility for it is an abuse of privilege and is prejudicial to the defendant. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 395</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 445 (1975).

                            Defendant's contention that district attorney's argument to the jury referring repeatedly to the fact that defense counsel was from another part of the State constituted prejudicial error and denied defendant due process and the effective assistance of
                            counsel would be overruled where defense counsel had opened the door with abusive comments attacking the credibility of two State witnesses and the honesty of two local law-enforcement officers. State v. McCall,

                            The defendant's constitutional rights under Article I, Sections 19, 23, and 27 of the North Carolina Constitution were not violated by the prosecution's argument in opposition to the "catchall" mitigating circumstance of

                            Right to Present a Defense. - Trial court did not err by excluding the testimony of a doctor under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 404, because
                            his testimony did not constitute evidence of the decedent's character for violence, but rather testified that the decedent was an angry person who had thoughts of violence. Because the trial court's exclusion of the expert's
                            testimony was within the bounds of the rules of evidence, defendant's right to present a defense under U.S. Const., amend. VI and this section was not violated. State v. McGrady, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 95,

                            Trial court erred by excluding the testimony of three character witnesses pertaining to the victim's past specific instances of violent conduct because the testimony was permitted under this section as defendant claimed he acted in self-defense, and the
                            exclusion of the evidence denied defendant his constitutional right to present a complete defense. State v. Bass, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 802 S.E.2d 477 (2017), rev'd on other

                            Trial court did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial by denying the defendant's pre-trial motion to continue the trial to a date more than 20 days after the defendant was charged in a true bill of indictment with habitual felon status; the assistant
                            district attorney handling the case, notified the court that the State was not going to proceed with the habitual felon charge until a later date, if at all, and after the jury verdict was announced, the State dismissed the
                            defendant's habitual felon indictment so that defendant was sentenced solely on the substantive charges against the defendant. State v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 576

                            When a motion to continue is based on a constitutional right, the trial court's ruling becomes a question of law and, upon appeal, it is subject to review by examination of the particular circumstances as presented by the record, and the denial of a motion
                            to continue, regardless of its nature, is grounds for a new trial only upon a showing by defendant that the denial was erroneous and that his case was prejudiced as a result of the error. If the error amounts to a constitutional
                            violation, as is here contended, there is prejudice requiring a new trial unless the State satisfies this court that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 591</cite>,

                            Jury Instructions. - Pattern jury instruction used by trial court was internally consistent and meaningful, and did not misuse the term "extenuating," nor define the term "mitigating circumstance" in such a way as to confuse jurors or violate the defendant's

                            explored the same point one more time and that defense counsel was acting unethically regarding a witness statement given to police that the defense counsel referred to but which was not admitted into evidence, were improper
                            and suggested the trial court was favoring the State in defendant's assault trial; since the comments were made in front of the jury, defendant was entitled to a new trial on the charge. State v. Brinkley,

                            Defendant's convictions were reversed as a trial court made comments that deprived defendant of a fair trial and violated his rights to due process when the trial court, inter alia: (1) sustained the trial court's own objections and refused to allow defendant
                            to continue to question the state's star witness about the witness's use of a false identification; (2) admonished defense counsel when counsel attempted to question the witness about the witness's criminal record; (3) chided
                            counsel when the trial court ruled on the state's objections; and (4) scolded counsel outside the presence of the jury when counsel attempted to make a record of the answers to questions that the trial court would not allow
                            counsel to ask in the jury's presence. State v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 640 S.E.2d 770 (2007).

                            Destruction of Evidence. - Destruction of marijuana by the State for lack of storage facilities, where the State made random samples, photographs and a copy of the laboratory report available to defendants, did not violate defendants' rights of confrontation
                            under this section, nor infringe defendants' due process rights under the federal and State Constitutions. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 292 S.E.2d 163, cert.

                            and, (2) despite the knife's unavailability, defense counsel was able to elicit impeaching testimony from the State's witnesses concerning the knife. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 488</cite>,

                            Revocation of Driver's License Cannot Constitute Double Jeopardy. - Revocation of defendant's driver's license did not constitute criminal punishment and, thus, defendant's conviction for driving while impaired did not violate N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Interrogation. - Second interrogation of a defendant was not unconstitutional under the facts of the case, and the trial court did not err by admitting the statement obtained by law enforcement officials during that second interrogation because uncontradicted
                            evidence introduced during the suppression hearing supported the conclusion that the law enforcement officials involved in the investigation of one incident honored the defendant's invocation of his right to remain silent regarding
                            another incident, and thereafter no questioning touched on that other incident and fresh Miranda warnings were given. State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 620 S.E.2d 204

                            mental capacity to understand the nature and object to the proceedings, to consult with counsel, and to assist in her defense, because defendant did not request a competency hearing or make a motion detailing the conduct resulting

                            Trial judge's ex parte interrogations of two seated jurors, conferences with counsel in chambers, out of the presence of the defendant, and the judge's failure to reconstruct those actions in the defendant's presence violated the defendant's right to
                            be present at every stage; however, because the court found that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 345</cite>,

                            Trial court did not violate the defendant's right to a fair trial because the defendant's trial had not commenced when the court held unrecorded bench conferences and deferred five jurors before the trial court began defendant's trial. The five jurors
                            were not excused at a stage of the defendant's trial, and the defendant did not have the right to be present at the conferences. State v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 35,

                            Although defendant's constitutional right to be present at every stage of defendant's criminal trial was violated when the trial court refused to allow defense counsel to review jury questions, the violation of that right was harmless beyond a reasonable
                            doubt; the record revealed that the questions indicated that the jury had already agreed unanimously on second-degree murder, which was defendant's ultimate conviction, and was confused about whether their rejection of first-degree
                            murder had to be unanimous. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 654 S.E.2d 730 (2008).

                        <p>
                            Error in excluding defendant from an in-chambers conference prior to the sentencing hearing was harmless, because defendant was given an opportunity to be heard at the hearing and the trial court reported the class level for each offense and any aggravating
                            and mitigating factors on the record in open court. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 640, 711 S.E.2d 797 (2011).

                            Even though the trial court's failure to disclose the third jury note violated defendant's right to presence, defendant was not prejudiced because had the trial court disclosed the note and defendant had renewed his objection under N.C. R. Evid. 403,
                            the trial court would not have had any reason to change its ruling admitting the inmate's testimony of defendant's confession and threats to potential witnesses. State v.

                            "stage" in the proceeding, the error in excluding defendant was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 560, 518 S.E.2d 222 (1999), appeal

   </span> 18, 19, 23, 24, and 27 were not violated by the trial court's failure to intervene ex mero motu in the prosecutor's closing argument, as while comparisons between criminal defendants and animals were strongly disfavored,
                            the state's use of an analogy to animals in packs helped explain the complex legal theory surrounding premeditation and deliberation. State v. Oakes, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 703 S.E.2d 476, review denied

                            Right to Remain Silent Not Violated. - State's cross-examination of defendant and its closing argument did not violate defendant's right to remain silent; it was not apparent that the State was commenting on post-Miranda silence when the State asked defendant
                            "So, you didn't want to tell them (the police) that you had acted in self-defense?" In addition, the closing argument was not improper and was supported by witnesses' testimony. State v. Herndon,

                            Defense Counsel Not Ineffective for Failing to Object Where Testimony Properly Admitted. - Testimony regarding an officer's interaction with a detective and a third individual was non-hearsay since it was not admitted to prove the truth of the matter
                            asserted, but rather to show how the officer formed a reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in the robbery at issue, which in turn justified including defendant's photo in a lineup shown to the robbery victim; since
                            this testimony was properly admitted, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to it. State v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 628 S.E.2d 434 (2006), cert.

                            Trial counsel's failure to object to the admission of testimony of a director of a rape crisis center about the general reactions and characteristics of sexual assault victims was not ineffective assistance of counsel as defendant failed to show that
                            trial counsel's failure to object fell below a standard of reasonableness, or that the trial result would have been different absent the error. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite>                            224, 662 S.E.2d 559 (2008).

                            Defendant's Rights Not Violated. - It was error to hold that the State violated defendant's rights under the Constitution because as a result of the State's improper prosecution in superior court, defendant had to appear in that court to seek dismissal
                            of the prosecution and had to appear before the court of appeals following the State's appeal State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 822 S.E.2d 902 (2018).

                            An indictment charging a statutory offense must allege all of the essential elements of the offense. State v. Crabtree, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 541</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 103 (1975).

                            Indictment Must Be Sufficient to Protect Defendant Against Subsequent Prosecution. - The allegations in a bill of indictment must particularize the crime charged and be sufficiently explicit to protect defendant against a subsequent prosecution for the
                            same offense. State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 711</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 849 (1961).

                            Special Form or Particular Words are Not Required. - This section does not require that the accused be informed of the charge against him in any special form or particular words, except that it must be by presentment or indictment. State v. Gibson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 318</cite>, 85 S.E. 7 (1915); State v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 767</cite>, 92 S.E. 373 (1917).

                            Since no conclusion could be reached by reading the indictment other than that defendant was in custody at the time he allegedly committed malicious conduct by a prisoner, the trial court had jurisdiction over his case, as the State adequately alleged
                            the offense such that defendant was notified of the offense against which he was called to defend. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 622 S.E.2d 204 (2005), cert. denied,

                            An indictment that charges in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner the criminal offense the accused is put to answer affords the protection guaranteed by this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            If an indictment charges the offense in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner and contains averments sufficient to enable the court to proceed to judgment, and to bar a subsequent prosecution for the same offense, it is sufficient. State v. Norwood,
                            <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).

                            Sufficiency of Charging Offense in Words of Statute. - While it is a general rule prevailing in this State that an indictment for a statutory offense is sufficient if the offense be charged in the words of the statute, the rule is inapplicable where the
                            words of the statute do not in themselves inform the defendant of the specific offense of which he is accused so as to enable him to prepare his defense or plead his conviction or acquittal as a bar to further prosecution for
                            the same offense, as where the statute characterizes the offense in mere general or generic terms, or does not sufficiently define the crime or set forth all its essential elements. In such situation, the statutory words must
                            be supplemented by other allegations which so plainly, intelligibly and explicitly set forth every essential element of the offense as to leave no doubt in the mind of the defendant and the court as to the offense intended
                            to be charged. State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 711</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 849 (1961).

                        <p>
                            An indictment for a statutory offense is sufficient as a general rule when it charges the offense in the language of the statute. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The court rejected the defendant's argument that because the indictment failed to allege two essential elements of first degree murder, i.e., premeditation and deliberation, his conviction of first degree murder based thereon violated Article I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span> 19, 22 and 23 of the North Carolina Constitution. The court found that the defendant had adequate notice of the charge against him, as North Carolina has for nearly 100 years authorized the use of the short form
                            murder indictment as sufficient to allege the elements of premeditation and deliberation, and the jury was properly required to find those elements beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Holder, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite>                            89, 530 S.E.2d 562 (2000).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant's indictment included the critical language found in the statute, alleging that he failed to meet his obligation to report, and this language was consistent with that found in the charging statute and provided defendant sufficient notice to
                            prepare a defense; additional detail about the reporting requirement was neither needed nor required, and thus the indictment was valid and conferred jurisdiction upon the trial court. State v. Williams,

                            Relationship of Dates of Alleged Offenses Listed in Indictment to Double Jeopardy. - If, as the general rule provides, the date of an offense is not material, then the critical issue is whether there is an indictment for each alleged offense; when there
                            is a corresponding number of indictments and offenses, then double jeopardy would only be a concern if the dates on the indictment are material. State v. Poston, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>                            642, 591 S.E.2d 898 (2004).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Absent evidence of the same number of incidents as indictments, time would have a most important effect upon the punishment, because a defendant will have received two consecutive terms of imprisonment for identical offenses based upon the same act, in
                            violation of defendant's Fifth Amendment right not to be twice tried for the same offense. State v. Poston, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 591 S.E.2d 898 (2004).

                            The time fixed in a bill of indictment usually is not an essential fact, and generally the State may prove that the crime was committed on another date; but when the State fixes the date in the indictment and the defendant presents evidence of an alibi
                            relating to that date, time becomes of the essence, and the State may not, after the defendant has presented his alibi evidence and rested his case, introduce evidence tending to show the defendant's commission of the crime
                            charged on another date. To permit a conviction on such evidence would violate rights guaranteed by this section. State v. Vincent, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 241 S.E.2d 390 (1978).

                            Statute which established a form for a bill of indictment for perjury and enacted in express terms that this form would be sufficient was sufficient to apprise the defendant with reasonable certainty of the nature of the crime of which he stood charged.

                            Aggravating Circumstances of Capital Offense Need Not Be Alleged. - The defendant's murder indictment complied with the requirements of this section and did not violate his constitutional rights; because defendant had notice that he was charged with first
                            degree murder and the elements thereof, as well as his eligibility for the death penalty, the State was not required to allege the supporting aggravating circumstances. State v. Holman, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 174</cite>,

                            Indictment for Larceny and Receiving Stolen Goods. - Defendant had a constitutional right to have a bill of indictment for larceny and receiving stolen goods state the kind of property he was alleged to have taken or received, so that he could know precisely
                            what he was called upon to meet, in order to have a fair and reasonable opportunity to prepare his defense, and so that, in the event of a conviction, the record might show with accuracy the exact offense of which he was convicted.
                            The use of the embrasive word "meat" in the bill of indictment deprived the defendant of this substantial constitutional right. State v. Nugent, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 100</cite>, 89 S.E.2d
                            781 (1955).

                        <p>
                            In an indictment for larceny, the description "automobile parts . . . of one Furches Motor Company" sufficiently identified the property alleged to have been stolen, as the description identified the type of parts and the owner from whom they were taken.

                            when the indictment was returned on the day of the trial, defendant was forced into a trial for which he was not allowed sufficient time to prepare his defense. State v. Smathers, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 226</cite>,

                            The word "confront" does not simply secure to the accused the privilege of examining witnesses in his behalf, but is an affirmance of the rule of the common law that in trials by jury the witness must be present before the jury and accused, so that he
                            may be confronted; that is, put face to face. And this, of course, includes the right of cross-examination. State v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. 66</cite> (1854); State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 74</cite>                            (1870); State v.

                            The word "confront" secures to the accused the right to have his witnesses in court and to examine them in his behalf. It further secures to the accused a fair opportunity to prepare and present his defense, which right must be afforded him not only in
                            form but in substance. State v. Hackney, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 230</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 778 (1954); State v. Graves, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 550</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 85 (1960).

                        <p>
                            The right of confrontation is an absolute right rather than a privilege, and it must be afforded an accused not only in form but in substance. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert.

                        <p>
                            The defendant is entitled to a full and fair cross-examination upon the subject of the witness' examination-in-chief, and this is an absolute right rather than a privilege. State v. Bumper, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 670</cite>,
                            170 S.E.2d 457 (1969).

                        <p>
                            Right to compulsory process is not absolute, and a state may require that a defendant requesting such process at state expense establish some colorable need for the person to be summoned, lest the right be abused by those who would make frivolous requests.
                            State v. House, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 189</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 654 (1978).

                            Actual Presence Required. - The essential characteristic of defendant's constitutional right to presence is just that, his actual presence during trial. State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 202</cite>, 410 S.E.2d

                            Under the N.C. State Constitution, defendant's actual presence is required throughout his trial, not just at particularly important junctures. State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 202</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 832 (1991).

                            Where an in-chambers conference occurred between the trial judge and counsel without defendant, defendant's constitutional right to be present at every stage of his capital trial was violated. State v. Meyer, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 619</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Where in-chambers discussion, which occurred outside of defendant's presence, was not included in the record, the court did not know the substance of the in-chambers conference held with the attorneys in defendant's absence; consequently, the court was
                            unable to determine whether the error committed was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and ordered a new sentencing proceeding. State v. Meyer, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 619</cite>, 481 S.E.2d

                            even though unrecorded, with counsel for both parties. State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 202</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 832 (1991).

                            State carried the burden of demonstrating that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where the court conducted a chambers conference with counsel for the state and counsel for defendant in the defendants absence. State v. Addison,

                            <span class="s1">

                            If, however, the subject matter of the conference implicates the defendant's confrontation rights, or is such that the defendant's presence would have a reasonably substantial relation to this opportunity to defend, the defendant would have a constitutional
                            right to be present. State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 202</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 832 (1991).

                        <p>
                            Defendant's absence during certain conferences and discussions in his capital trial did not prejudice defendant in any way and was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, where defendant's counsel was present, as was the court reporter, who recorded and transcribed
                            the complete proceedings, the subjects of the conferences and discussions were either points of law, procedural matters, or administrative matters, none of which involved communication with the jury, and no witness gave testimony
                            concerning defendant's guilt. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 1</cite>, 409 S.E.2d 288 (1991).

                            Right to Be Present at Every Stage. - This section is the sole source of the criminal defendant's nonwaivable state right to be present at every stage of his capital trial and of the corollary duty imposed on the trial court to insure his presence. State
                            v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1990), in light of McKoy
                            v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), death sentence vacated, remanded for new capital sentencing proceeding, State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 532</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 577 (1991).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The confrontation clause of the Constitution of North Carolina guarantees the right of the defendant to be present at every stage of the trial. This state constitutional protection afforded to the defendant imposes on the trial court the affirmative duty
                            to insure the defendant's presence at every stage of a capital trial. The defendant's right to be present at every stage of the trial ought to be kept forever sacred and inviolate. In fact, the defendant's right to be present
                            at every stage of his capital trial is not waivable. State v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 65</cite>, 418 S.E.2d 213 (1992).

                        <p>
                            Even though the trial court's failure to disclose the third jury note violated defendant's right to presence, defendant was not prejudiced because had the trial court disclosed the note and defendant had renewed his objection under N.C. R. Evid. 403,
                            the trial court would not have had any reason to change its ruling admitting the inmate's testimony of defendant's confession and threats to potential witnesses. State v. Mackey, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite>                            586, 774 S.E.2d 382 (2015).

                            Right Includes Opportunity to Face Accusers and Witnesses with Other Testimony. - Defendants have a constitutional right of confrontation, which cannot lawfully be taken from them, and this includes the right of a fair opportunity to face the accusers
                            and witnesses with other testimony. State v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 361</cite>, 166 S.E. 180 (1932).

                            A defendant has the constitutional right, in a criminal prosecution, to confront his accusers with other testimony. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 176 S.E.2d 41 (1970), rev'd on other grounds,

                            Right to Cross-Examine. - The right of a defendant to confront his accusers includes the right to cross-examine them on any subject touched on in their examination-in-chief, and a witness testifying to facts incriminating defendant on his examination-in-chief
                            may not deprive defendant of his right to cross-examine him on the ground that answers to questions asked on cross-examination might tend to incriminate the witness. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 796</cite>,
                            188 S.E. 639 (1936).

                        <p>
                            The right to confront affirms the common-law rule that in criminal trials by jury the witness must be present and subject to cross-examination under oath. State v. Bumper, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 670</cite>, 170 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            A party to either a civil or criminal proceeding may elicit from an opposing witness on cross-examination particular facts having a logical tendency to show that the witness is biased against him, hostile to his cause, or interested adversely to him in
                            the outcome of the litigation. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 395</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 445 (1975).

                            One of the most jealously guarded rights in the administration of justice is that of cross-examining an adversary's witnesses. State v. Carey, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 254</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 387 (1975), death sentence

                            Absence During Part of Prosecution's Presentation. - Nothing in the record showed that defendant was prejudiced by his absence during part of the presentation of the prosecution's evidence in defendant's capital case where all proceedings took place in
                            open court; everything that took place was reflected in the record, and the record showed that defense counsel were in court and participated throughout defendant's absence to protect his interest, the trial judge told counsel
                            they could confer with defendant as to the possibility of his return at any time, and the trial judge undertook to perform his duty to assure defendant's presence. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>,

                            Right Not Violated When Court Conducted Bench Conferences with Counsel for Both Parties. - A defendant's state constitutional right to be present at all stages of his capital trial was not violated when the trial court conducted bench conferences with
                            counsel for both parties while the defendant was present in the courtroom. State v. Upchurch, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 439</cite>, 421 S.E.2d 577 (1992).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the trial court conducted numerous bench conferences with counsel in which defendant did not participate, nothing in the record indicated that defendant was not present in the courtroom during their discussions, the trial court received no evidence
                            during any of these bench conferences, and most of the discussion concerned mechanical aspects of the proceedings, including lunch breaks, presentation of proposed instruction by the trial court to counsel for their comments,
                            and argument of technical motions or objections out of the jury's hearing; therefore, because defendant was represented by counsel during each of these conferences, nothing in the record demonstrates how defendant's presence
                            would have served any useful purpose, nor does defendant demonstrate how the conferences impinged upon his opportunity to defend and failed to demonstrate any violation of his constitutional protections. State v. Bacon,
                            <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 66</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 542 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1159, 115 S. Ct. 1120, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1083 (1995).

                            Trial court's unrecorded private communications with three prospective jurors, perhaps violative of defendant's nonwaivable constitutional right to be present at every stage of his trial, were harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt because the record
                            adequately revealed the substance of those communications and the jurors were properly excused. State v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 483</cite>, 515 S.E.2d 885 (1999).

                            Right Violated by Court's Private Bench Conferences with Jurors. - The fact that the jury recommended and the trial court entered a sentence of life imprisonment did not change the capital nature of that trial or his status as a capital defendant in that
                            trial. Therefore, the unwaiveable requirement of his presence applied at every stage of his trial and was violated by the trial court's private bench conferences with prospective jurors. State v. Johnston,
                            <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 680</cite>, 417 S.E.2d 228 (1992).

                        <p>
                            Jury selection is a stage of a capital trial at which the defendant must be present. The trial court erred by conducting bench conferences with prospective jurors out of the hearing of the defendant and his counsel. Therefore, the Supreme Court had to
                            order a new trial. State v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 65</cite>, 418 S.E.2d 213 (1992).

                            Exclusion of Defendant from In Camera Hearing with Juror. - Although it is clearly error for the trial court to communicate with a juror in chambers in the absence of defendant, counsel, or a court reporter, not every violation of a constitutional right
                            is prejudicial. Where the record of an in camera hearing attended only by a juror, the trial judge, counsel, and a court reporter reflected the benign substance of the conversation, the juror's growing unease with her ability
                            to impose the death penalty, and where after the hearing the juror was promptly and properly removed for cause, obviating the possibility that anything said to her privately by the trial court might infect the jury as a whole,
                            this action was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 278</cite>, 384 S.E.2d 470 (1989), sentence vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494

                        <p>
                            It was error for the trial court to exclude the defendants, their counsel, and the court reporter from its private conversations with prospective jurors prior to excusing those jurors. State v. Johnston, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 680</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Although it is error for the trial court to conduct a chambers conference with counsel for the state and counsel for defendant in defendant's absence, where defendant was present during the questioning of a juror and was fully apprised of the facts underlying
                            the reasons for the juror's excusal, defendant had full opportunity to be heard and to lodge any objection he might have. State v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 243</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 298

                            Judge's Ex Parte Communications with Jury Before Verdict Rendered. - Where, during the course of the trial, the presiding trial judge engaged in an ex parte communication with the jury, and prior to reconvening court, the judge entered the jury room where
                            the jurors had gathered and was alone with the jurors, this conduct on the part of the presiding judge violated the defendant's rights under N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Assuming arguendo that judge's chance meeting in the corridor with jurors during a recess at which time judge and jurors discussed, inter alia, cameras in the courtroom and selection of a foreman, did constitute a "stage" of a capital proceeding, the
                            error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where there existed in the record a reconstruction of the ex parte conversations. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 122</cite>,

                            Where the court found two prospective jurors were ineligible to serve due to their recent service as prospective jurors, and third prospective juror, who had arranged to be a pallbearer at a funeral, was deferred for a "manifestly unobjectionable" reason,
                            the error of the judge in communicating ex parte with the prospective jurors was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 401</cite>, 439 S.E.2d 760 (1994).

                            Ex parte "communication" between judge and jury, wherein the trial judge routinely inquired about any problems individual jurors might have that he needed to know about, did not violate defendant's state and federal constitutional rights to be present
                            during the proceedings against him, where the trial judge's statement indicated that no such problems were either expressed by the jurors or discussed with them by the trial judge. State v. Laws,

                            Where there was a sufficient record of the substance of ex parte communications between the judge and both prosecutor and defense counsel and defendant had opportunity to challenge the ruling in open court when it was announced in his presence, defendant
                            was not prejudiced by the communications. State v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 243</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 298 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1135, 115 S. Ct. 953, 130 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1995).

                            Private Discussion Between Judge and Jurors who had been Dismissed. - Defendant's State and federal constitutional rights to be present at all stages of his trial were not violated when the trial court talked privately with jurors, since the transcript
                            showed that the trial judge sent all those who still were prospective jurors home and indicated that he was going to talk only to those whom he had dismissed from jury service. State v. Laws,
                            <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 81</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 609 (1989), sentence vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1022, 110 S. Ct. 1465, 108 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1990).

                            No violation of defendant's constitutional right to be present at every stage of his trial, pursuant to this section, occurred on account of the trial court's alleged ex parte communication with, and the excusing of, a juror. The trial court's memorialization
                            of the private communication between the prospective juror, the clerk and the trial court, which was neither questioned nor objected to by defendant or his counsel, disclosed that the prospective juror was excused for a valid
                            reason and that the communication was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Holder, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 530 S.E.2d 562 (2000).

                            Bailiff's Communication with Prospective Jurors. - Where the bailiff was ordered to engage in unrecorded communications with prospective jurors and the trial jury, the actions of the clerk involved the clerk's administrative duties of calling the jury
                            roll and explaining to the jurors what time they needed to arrive at court and did not relate to the consideration of defendant's guilt or innocence; therefore, no constitutional violation occurred. State v. Bacon,

                            Trial Judge May Limit Cross-Examination for Purposes of Impeachment. - When cross-examination is made for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness, the method and duration of the cross-examination for these purposes rest largely in the discretion
                            of the trial court, and the trial court may properly exclude such cross-examination when it becomes merely repetitious or argumentative. State v. Bumper, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 670</cite>,

                            To convict the defendant under the theory of aiding and abetting, the State has the burden of proving, among other things, that the crimes alleged have in fact been committed. Although it is not required that the principal be convicted, the guilt of the
                            principal must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden cannot be carried by testimony concerning judgments rendered in other trials to which the defendant was not a party and not able to cross-examine witnesses.
                            The admission of such evidence violates defendant's right to confrontation under the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of North Carolina. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 361</cite>,

                            Undue Repetition, Argumentativeness and Peripheral Inquiry Should Be Banned. - While it is axiomatic that the cross-examiner ought to be allowed wide latitude, the trial judge has the responsibility to exercise his discretion in such a way that unduly
                            repetitive and argumentative questioning, as well as inquiry into matters which are only peripherally relevant, are banned. State v. Royal, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 515</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 517

                            Right to Prepare and Present Defense Guaranteed. - The constitutional right of a defendant in a criminal prosecution to confront his accusers and adverse witnesses with other testimony, as provided by this section, includes the right to a fair opportunity
                            to prepare and present his defenses, which right must be accorded him not only in form, but in substance as well. State v. Whitfield, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 696</cite>, 175 S.E. 93, cert.
                            denied, 293 U.S. 556, 55 S. Ct. 114, 79 L. Ed. 658 (1934); State v. Utley, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 39</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 195 (1943); State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 497</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 520 (1949), discussed

                        <p>
                            The right of confrontation carries with it not only the right to face one's accusers and witnesses with other testimony, but also the opportunity fairly to present one's defense. State v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 349</cite>,
                            128 S.E.2d 389 (1962).

                        <p>
                            Due process requires that every defendant be allowed a reasonable time and opportunity to investigate and produce competent evidence, if he can, in defense of the crime with which he stands charged and to confront his accusers with other testimony. State
                            v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 690</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 526 (1970); State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 105</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 426 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Every defendant is entitled under the Constitution to have a reasonable opportunity to prepare his defense. This includes the right to consult with his counsel and to have a fair and reasonable opportunity, in the light of all attendant circumstances,
                            to investigate, to prepare, as well as to present his defense. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 176 S.E.2d 41 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>,

                        <p>
                            It is implicit in the guarantees of assistance of counsel and confrontation of one's accusers and witnesses that an accused have a reasonable time to investigate, prepare and present his defense. However, no set length of time for investigation, preparation
                            and presentation is required, and whether defendant is denied due process must be determined upon the basis of the circumstances of each case. State v. Vick, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 37</cite>,
                            213 S.E.2d 335, cert. dismissed, 423 U.S. 918, 96 S. Ct. 228, 46 L. Ed. 2d 367 (1975); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 681</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 437 (1976).

                            The right of a defendant charged with a criminal offense to present to the jury his version of the facts is a fundamental element of due process of law, guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. State v. Locklear,
                            <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 118</cite>, 505 S.E.2d 277 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1075, 119 S. Ct. 1475, 143 L. Ed. 2d 559 (1999).

                            When Right Not Denied by Refusing Continuance. - The denial of a continuance is not prejudicial error where the record fails to show that it would have enabled defendant and his counsel to obtain additional evidence or otherwise present a stronger defense.
                            State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 497</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 520 (1948).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motions for a continuance before trial and during trial as the defendant failed to prove he would acquire proof of his innocence because of the continuance. State v. Marecek,
                            <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 568 S.E.2d 237 (2002).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a continuance did not deprive him of his constitutional rights because defendant was on notice that the victim's wife was a witness he would wish to consult with about his case; defendant's motion for a continuance
                            was not supported by an affidavit and did not describe with any particularity what the wife's testimony would be beyond "exculpatory statements" that would "impeach her own husband and would impeach his credibility." State

                            When Motion for Continuance Presents Question of Law. - When a motion for a continuance in a criminal case is based on a right guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 19, the question presented is one of law and not of discretion, and the decision of the court below is reviewable. State v. Farrell, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 321</cite>, 26 S.E.2d 322 (1943); State v. Lane,
                            <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 349</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 389 (1962); State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 172 S.E.2d 249 (1970).

                        <p>
                            A motion for continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and his ruling thereon is not subject to review on appeal, except in a case of manifest abuse; however, when the motion is based on a right guaranteed by the federal and
                            State Constitutions, the question presented is one of law and the order of the court is reviewable. State v. Phillip, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 263</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 386, cert. denied, 377
                            U.S. 1003, 84 S. Ct. 1939, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1052, rehearing denied, 379 U.S. 874, 85 S. Ct. 28, 13 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1964); State v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 644</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 551 (1976); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 681</cite>,

                        <p>
                            While a motion for continuance is ordinarily addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial court's ruling is not subject to review absent abuse of discretion, if the motion is based on the constitutional right of confrontation, in
                            that the refusal of the motion denied defendant a reasonable time within which to prepare and present his defense, the decision of the trial court is reviewable as a question of law. State v. Abernathy,
                            <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 147</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 373 (1978); State v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 55</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 410 (1981), overruled on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 432</cite>, 333

                            Presence of Witnesses Required. - The right of confrontation confirms the common-law rule that, in criminal trials, the witnesses must be present and subject to cross-examination. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Introduction of Transcribed Testimony. - The constitutional right of confrontation is not denied an accused by the introduction at a subsequent trial of the transcribed testimony given at a former trial of the same action by a witness who has since died,
                            become insane, left the State permanently or for an indefinite absence, become incapacitated to testify in court as a result of a permanent or indefinite illness, or absented himself by procurement of, or connivance with, the
                            accused. The accuracy of the transcription must be attested and it must appear that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine the witness. State v. Prince, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 769</cite>,

                            Duly Authenticated Copy of Record. - While this section gives to the accused the right to confront his accusers, such does not apply when the facts, from their very nature, can only be proved by a duly authenticated copy of a record. State v. Dowdy,
                            <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 432</cite>, 58 S.E. 1002 (1907).

                            Statements falling within an exception to the general prohibition against hearsay may be admitted into evidence without violating a defendant's right to confrontation, if the evidence is reliable. State v. Stager, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 278</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Where hearsay proffered by the prosecution comes within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, this constitutional provision was not violated, even though no particularized showing was made as to the necessity for using such hearsay or as to its
                            reliability or trustworthiness. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 644</cite>, 503 S.E.2d 101 (1998).

                            Use of Hearsay in Criminal Trial. - A prosecutor is prohibited by U.S. Const., Amend. VI and this section from introducing any hearsay evidence in a criminal trial unless two requirements are met. The prosecution must show both the necessity for using
                            the hearsay testimony and the inherent trustworthiness of the original declaration. State v. Gregory, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 565, 338 S.E.2d 110 (1985), cert. denied and appeal

                            Use of Hearsay in Sentencing Proceedings. - Trial court did not err in admitting hearsay evidence of an alleged bribe offered to the witness by defendant at defendant's sentencing; further, the use of this hearsay evidence did not violate the Confrontation
                            Clause. State v. Sings, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 162, 641 S.E.2d 370, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 574</cite>, 2007 N.C. LEXIS 885 (2007).

                        <p>
                            There is a two-prong constitutional test for the admission of hearsay under the confrontation clause, i.e., necessity and trustworthiness. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 129, 484 S.E.2d 405 (1997),
                            rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 644</cite>, 503 S.E.2d 101 (1998).

                        <p>
                            The prosecution in a criminal trial must, as prerequisite to the introduction of hearsay evidence, show the necessity for using the hearsay testimony and establish the inherent trustworthiness of the original declaration. State v. Jackson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 129, 484 S.E.2d 405 (1997), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 644</cite>, 503 S.E.2d 101 (1998).

                        <p>
                            In-Court Identification. - Where the evidence shows that witness had a good and sufficient opportunity to observe a defendant at the time the offense was being committed, and testifies that his in-court identification is based on his observation made
                            at that time, the test of "clear and convincing evidence" is met. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 210 S.E.2d 876, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 470</cite>,

                        <p>
                            If there is objection to an in-court identification by a witness who participated in an illegal lineup procedure, such evidence must be excluded unless it be determined on voir dire that the in-court identification is of independent origin and therefore
                            not tainted by the illegal lineup. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).

                            Out-of-Court Declarations of Codefendant. - Even when the right of confrontation is afforded to a defendant implicated in the out-of-court declarations of a codefendant, the prejudicial impact of testimony of the codefendant's declarations must be evaluated
                            in the light of the competent evidence admitted against the nondeclarant defendant. The gap between the impact of evidence which is not admitted against but incriminates the nondeclarant and of competent evidence of minimal
                            probative value admitted against him in a given case may be so great as to constitute a denial of due process. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 322</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 858 (1972).

                            Admission of Codefendant's Confession Inculpating Accused. - An accused's constitutional right of cross-examination is violated at his joint trial with a codefendant who does not testify, when the court admits the codefendant's confession inculpating
                            the accused, notwithstanding jury instructions that the confession must be disregarded in determining the accused's guilt or innocence. State v. Heard, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 167</cite>,

                        <p>
                            In joint trials of defendants it is necessary to exclude extrajudicial confessions unless all portions which implicate defendants other than the declarant can be deleted without prejudice either to the State or declarant, and if such deletion is not possible,
                            the State must choose between relinquishing the confession or trying the defendants separately, assuming (1) that the confession is inadmissible as to the codefendant, and (2) that the declarant will not take the stand. State
                            v. Heard, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 167</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 826 (1974).

                            Rights of Person Accused of Offense involving Intoxication. - When a person is taken into police custody for an offense of which intoxication is an essential element, time is of the essence, as intoxication does not last. Thus, if one accused of driving
                            while intoxicated is to have witnesses for his defense, he must have access to his counsel, friends, relatives, or some disinterested person within a relatively short time after his arrest. The statute says he is entitled to
                            communicate with them immediately, and this is true whether he is arrested at 2:00 A.M. or 2:00 P.M. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).

                            Court May Not Forbid Defendant to Offer Detrimental Evidence. - The trial court is not authorized to forbid a defendant appearing in propria persona to offer evidence, otherwise competent, for the reason that, in the judgment of the court, however sound,
                            such evidence would be detrimental to the defendant. The defendant, whether represented by counsel or appearing in propria persona, is entitled to use his own judgment as to the wisdom of introducing otherwise competent evidence.
                            To deny him this right is to deny him his constitutional rights afforded both by U.S. Const., Amend. VI and this section. State v. House, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 189</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 654

                            to the evidence is not sufficient. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 784</cite>, 25 S.E. 783 (1896).

                            Proper standard for reversal in reviewing violations under this section of defendant's right to be present at all stages of his capital trial is the rigorous standard prescribed for review of violations of defendant's right to be present at trial under

                            Admission of nonhearsay raises no Confrontation Clause concerns; testimony regarding an officer's interaction with a detective and a third individual was non-hearsay, and raised no Confrontation Clause concerns, since it was not admitted to prove the
                            truth of the matter asserted, but rather to show how the officer formed a reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in the robbery at issue, which in turn justified including defendant's photo in a lineup shown to the

                            The taking of depositions in another state in the absence of the defendant was assumed by the court to be a "stage" of his capital trial. However, it was clear that all of the testimony of the witnesses during the taking of those depositions tended to
                            support mitigating circumstances. The admission of those depositions into evidence during the capital sentencing proceeding, therefore, could not possibly have harmed the defendant. Accordingly, the State bore its burden of

                            conference, and the only unrecorded conference occurred during voir dire of a prospective juror who was excused for cause because her views would prevent or substantially impair her performance as juror. State v. Bonnett,
                            <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 417</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 563 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1124, 119 S. Ct. 909, 142 L. Ed. 2d 907 (1999).

                            Defendant waived the right to be present during jury selection where defendant refused to sit quietly in the courtroom; defendant waived the right to raise the issue on appeal where defendant did not object at trial or allege plain error. State v. Miller,
                            <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite> 494, 553 S.E.2d 410 (2001).

                            No Right to Be Present at Pre-Trial Venue and Venire Negotiations. - The defendants' federal and state constitutional rights to be present at every stage of their capital trial were not violated when the court ordered the jury drawn from a special venire;
                            although they were not present during out-of-court meetings relating to change of venue or a special venire which took place prior to commencement of defendants' trial, they were present at the hearing on change of venue; furthermore,
                            when the trial court proposed a special venire, both defendants agreed, through counsel. State v. Golphin, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 364</cite>, 533 S.E.2d 168 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S.

                            Private Discussions with Prospective Jurors. - In capital case, trial court's error in having unrecorded private discussions with prospective jurors was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as the record did not indicate that any action was taken by the
                            trial judge as a result of these discussions. State v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite> 442, 564 S.E.2d 285 (2002), appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 443</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Trial court's action in excusing prospective jurors as a result of its private unrecorded bench conferences with them violated defendant's state constitutional right to be present at every stage of the trial and violated statutory requirements to make
                            a true, complete and accurate record of the jury selection in a capital trial pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1241ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1241(a)</a></cite>.

                            Ex Parte Communication with and Dismissal of Jurors Held Harmless. - The court's dismissal of six prospective jurors after unrecorded, private bench discussions was harmless where the preliminary questioning of prospective jurors did not result in the
                            rejection of any juror whom defendant was entitled to have on the panel or the seating of any juror whom defendant was entitled to reject either for cause or peremptorily. State v. Cummings,

                            Clerk of Court's Communication with Jurors. - The trial court's direction to the clerk of court to meet privately with jurors about transportation and other logistical matters did not violate the defendants' constitutional rights, although the court omitted
                            a warning to some of the jurors that "no one can answer or would answer any questions about any other aspect of the trial"; absent proof to the contrary, the appellate court assumed that the clerk did not discuss bus routes
                            or travel time or other information which might relate to the crime but limited any discussion to logistics and administrative matters. State v. Golphin, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 364</cite>,

                            Handling and Disclosure of Jury Notes. - The trial court did not violate defendant's federal or state constitutional rights to presence and effective assistance of counsel by refusing to disclose the full content of notes from the jury, failing to let
                            counsel see or read the notes, or responding without eliciting and considering the informed positions of defendant and his counsel where the court substantially disclosed the content, heard from counsel and responded in open
                            court to each of the communications. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 1</cite>, 539 S.E.2d 243 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 839, 122 S. Ct. 95, 151 L. Ed. 2d 55 (2001).

                            Absence of Material Witness. - Defendants' right to confrontation was not denied by refusal of a motion to continue, on the ground of the absence of a material, expert, fingerprint witness, where the prosecuting attorney agreed that he would not offer
                            evidence as to fingerprints. State v. Rising, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 747</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 221 (1943).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not violate this section by denying a capital murder defendant's motions for a recess or continuance and for a mistrial after an eyewitness could not be located; defendant had the benefit of witness' tape-recorded statements to both the
                            Sheriff's Department and his own counsel, and the evidence indicated the witness had gone into hiding for a long period under circumstances indicating no likelihood of locating him within a reasonable period of time. State
                            v. Roper, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 337</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 600, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 902, 112 S. Ct. 280, 116 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1991).

                        <p>
                            Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to present witnesses to confront the evidence against him because his counsel's unsworn statement in support of a continuance, regarding the testimony of a witness whose location had just been discovered
                            the day before, failed to provide detailed proof of a reason for delay and actually supported the State's case. State v. Cody, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 722, 522 S.E.2d 777 (1999).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred by allowing a witness's deposition testimony to be entered into evidence in lieu of her live testimony due to her military deployment in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>,
                            N.C. R. Evid. 804, U.S. Const. amend. VI, and this article because the trial court failed to make the required findings of fact to demonstrate unavailability for the purposes of Rule 804 or the Confrontation Clause, the State
                            failed in its burden of showing that the witness could not be made present at trial by process or other reasonable means, and the State failed in its burden of proving it had carried its constitutionally required burden of
                            demonstrating that it had made a good-faith effort to obtain the witness' presence at trial. State v. Clonts, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 95, 802 S.E.2d 531 (2017), aff'd, review improvidently allowed, in part,

                            Inability of Codefendants to Communicate. - Findings in post-conviction proceedings that petitioners, although jointly tried, were not allowed to communicate with one another prior to trial, and that their attempts to contact witnesses and friends were
                            unsuccessful, did not support the lower court's conclusion of law that petitioners had not been denied any rights guaranteed to them by this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Analysis of Evidence by Expert. - In defendant's trial on a charge of first degree murder, the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion for a continuance so she could find an expert to analyze the State's expert's conclusion that there was blood
                            splatter on defendant's clothes which suggested that defendant was present when a victim was struck, and the appellate court ordered a new trial because the State did not carry its burden of showing that the trial court's ruling
                            was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Barlowe, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 578 S.E.2d 660 (2003).

                            Trial court properly denied defendant's motions to strike the death penalty and to suppress ballistics evidence. Because the State's failure to preserve potentially useful evidence from a crime scene was negligent at worst and there was no suggestion
                            of bad faith, defendant's due process rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Trial court abused its discretion in excluding defendant's expert from testifying about tampering on defendant's computer, as the expert was experienced with the subject matter and was in a better position to have an opinion on the subject than was the

                            defendants' contention that they were entitled to an inspection of the files of the Bureau in regard to its investigation of the case was untenable, and denial of their petition for such inspection did not violate any of their

                            he wishes to assert his right to cross-examine the witness, must request the court to have the witness return to the stand, and when he fails to do so, he may not assert that he was deprived of his constitutional right of confrontation.

                            to testify," amounted to an implicit declaration of unavailability; the State fulfilled the constitutional requirement of the confrontation clause by showing a good faith attempt to secure the witness for trial since the State
                            produced the witness and attempted to elicit her testimony. State v. Chandler, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 172</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 728 (1989).

                            State Violated Confrontation Clause Requirement Where Good Faith Efforts Were Not Shown. - In a capital murder case, defendant's confrontation rights were violated where there was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the State employed good-faith
                            efforts to contact and produce a witness at sentencing. State v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 433</cite>, 584 S.E.2d 765 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Admission of Prior Testimony. - Where a trial was terminated prior to verdict at the instance of defendant in order to obtain other counsel, the testimony of a witness at such trial, with full cross-examination taken in open court and properly attested,
                            was properly admitted in evidence at the subsequent trial when it appeared that the witness was then on military duty outside the boundaries of the United States, and the admission of such testimony did not violate defendant's
                            right of confrontation. State v. Prince, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 769</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 897 (1967).

                        <p>
                            The admission of co-conspirator/brother's prior trial testimony did not violate the defendant's state or federal constitutional rights to confrontation and cross-examination; where the testimony was trustworthy and more probative than any other evidence
                            which the State could produce through reasonable efforts. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 537 S.E.2d 518 (2000).

                            Admission of Hearsay Evidence Pursuant to an Exception for an Unavailable Declarant. - Appellate court erred in finding that defendant's right to confrontation pursuant to N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 23 was violated by allowing an officer to testify pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 804(b)(5), that the deceased victim
                            picked defendant from a lineup; although the hearsay statement was testimonial, and thus implicated the confrontation clause, the error was harmless pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa91s15A-1443ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1443(b)</a></cite>,
                            as the outcome of the trial probably would have been the same if the lineup was excluded. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 1</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 830 (2005), vacated, remanded, Lewis v. North Carolina, 126 S. Ct.

                            The trial court's admission of the victim's testimony from a domestic violence protective order hearing did not violate his right to confront the witness against him as guaranteed by both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and this
                            section, nor did it violate <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, Rules 803(3), 404(b), and 403 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence,
                            where the hearsay statements constituted, and were admissible as, statements of the declarant's then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition and where their probative value outweighed their prejudicial effect. State

                            Record Showing Guilty Plea by Codefendant. - In a prosecution for aiding and abetting, admission of record showing that codefendants had pleaded guilty to the offense deprived defendant of her right of confrontation. State v. Jackson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 773</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 236 (1967).

                        <p>
                            Where defendant changed his plea from guilty to not guilty and requested the court to allow him time to obtain witnesses from other states, it was error for the court to force him to trial on the succeeding day, since, under the facts of the case, defendant
                            was not given time to prepare for trial. State v. Whisnant, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 736</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 545 (1967).

                            Deprivation of Right to Call for Evidence. - Where the effect of failure of the arresting officer and of the custodian of the arrested person to perform their respective duties was such as to deprive the person of the constitutional right to call for
                            evidence in his favor, his subsequent conviction lacked the required due process of law and could not stand. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).

                            Extrajudicial statements made by defendants which implicated a codefendant were not inadmissible where each declarant took the stand and testified that the substance of the statements attributed to him was false. State v. Jones,
                            <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 322</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 858 (1972).

                            Death Certificate. - Defendant's right to confrontation and his right to fundamental fairness in a criminal trial guaranteed by due process were violated by the admission in evidence of the hearsay and conclusory statement in the victim's death certificate.

                            Disclosure of Informant. - Disclosure of informant whose information led the police to defendant would not be relevant or helpful to defendant where there was ample independent evidence of his guilt. State v. McDougald,
                            <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 197 S.E.2d 11, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 756</cite>, 198 S.E.2d 726 (1973).

                        <p>
                            Where defendant did not contend that informant participated in or witnessed alleged crime, he had no constitutional right to discover the name of the informant. State v. Ketchie, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 387</cite>, 211

                            Inspection of Witness' Statement. - Defendants' constitutionally protected rights of confrontation, due process, and equal protection were violated by the denial of their request to inspect what they contended was a written pretrial out-of-court statement
                            by the State's witness. State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 210 S.E.2d 555 (1974), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 434 (1975),

                            Search Warrant and Affidavit. - It is error to allow a search warrant together with the affidavit to obtain the search warrant to be introduced into evidence, because the statements and allegations contained in the affidavit are hearsay statements which
                            deprive the accused of his rights of confrontation and cross-examination. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 210 S.E.2d 876, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 470</cite>,

                            Admission of Evidence Held Proper. - In defendant's trial on charges of first degree murder, first degree burglary, second degree kidnapping, and robbery with a dangerous weapon, the trial court properly admitted the videotaped statement defendant's wife
                            gave to police, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 804(b)(5), after defendant's wife refused to testify
                            for the State at defendant's trial, properly admitted letters one of defendant's co-conspirators wrote to a girlfriend urging the girlfriend to lie about the girlfriend's involvement in the co-conspirator's attempt to conceal
                            evidence of the crime, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 804(b)(3), (b)(5), and properly admitted evidence of similar crimes defendant

                        <p>
                            Court of Appeals erred by failing to find that any error that the trial court might have committed by admitting the challenged portion of the officer's testimony, regarding the victim's statements that defendant had kept the victim in her apartment for
                            about two hours and engaged in a physical struggle with her, was non-prejudicial, as the victim's statements provided the officer with information which led him to ensure defendant was no longer in the apartment and a threat
                            to the victim. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 273</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 93 (2018).

                            Admission of Deposition Testimony of State's Absent Witness. - Even though it was error to admit the State's physician's deposition testimony at defendant's murder trial even though the defendant took advantage of his right to cross examine the physician
                            at the deposition, because the defendant did not have the right to confront him at trial; the error was harmless error in view of the overwhelming testimonial and other evidence that the victim died and of the defendant's guilt.

                            Admission of Hearsay Evidence Where the Declarant was Unavailable. - For purposes of a claim of a confrontation clause violation under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 23, a trial court's confrontation clause analysis of a statement should proceed as follows: the initial determination is whether the statement is testimonial or nontestimonial, and if the statement is testimonial,
                            the trial court must then ask whether the declarant is available or unavailable to testify during the trial; if the declarant is unavailable pursuant to the <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>,
                            N.C. R. Evid. 804(b)(5) hearsay exception, the trial court must determine whether the accused had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant about this statement, and if the accused had such an opportunity, the statement
                            may be admissible if it is not otherwise excludable hearsay, but if the accused did not have this opportunity, the statement must be excluded. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 1</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 830 (2005),
                            vacated, remanded, Lewis v. North Carolina, 126 S. Ct. 2983, 165 L. Ed. 2d. 985 (2006) (remanded for further consideration in light of Davis v. Washington, 126 S. Ct. 226, 165 L. Ed. 2d. 224 (2006)).

                            Trial court's denial of defendant's motion for separate trial so prejudiced his defense as to amount to a denial of due process and his right to confrontation where defendant was precluded under the circumstances of the joint trial from introducing evidence
                            of codefendant's out-of-court statement, which would have strengthened defendant's alibi defense. State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 372</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 222, death sentence vacated,
                            429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).

                            New Trial Required Where In-Chambers Conference Held in Defendant's Absence. - Because in-chambers conference that took place with the attorneys in defendant's absence at conclusion of testimony by forensic psychiatry expert was not recorded, and the
                            nature and content of the private discussion could not be gleaned from the record, the State failed to meet its burden of showing that holding in-chambers discussion in defendant's absence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,
                            and a new trial was ordered. State v. Exum, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 291</cite>, 470 S.E.2d 333 (1996).

                            Waiver of Plain Error Review. - Defendant's claim that he was deprived of his constitutional rights under the Confrontation Clause by the admission of out-of-court statements was waived under N.C. R. App. P. 10(b)(1) because defendant lodged only a general
                            objection but did not object on constitutional grounds and did not assert on appeal plain error, as permitted under Rule 10(c); thus, plain error review was waived, and defendant's constitutional argument was not properly before
                            the court on appeal. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 639 S.E.2d 78, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 364</cite>, 644 S.E.2d 555 (2007).

                            No Error in Quashing Subpoena Where Defendant Never Showed Necessity for Compliance. - In an armed robbery prosecution, the trial court did not err in allowing the state's motion to quash the defendant's subpoena for "all the sawed-off shotguns confiscated
                            by the Greensboro Police Department" since the date of the robbery, since defendant never stated why compliance with the subpoena was necessary to his defense, and the burden was on defendant not only to show error but also
                            to show that the error complained of affected the result adversely to him. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 489</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 116 (1980).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly determined that in-court identifications were not tainted by a pretrial photographic procedure, where the court found upon supporting voir dire evidence that the witnesses had ample opportunity to observe defendant during the course
                            of the robbery in question; the in-court identifications of defendant were of independent origin based solely on what the witnesses saw at the time of the robbery and did not result from any out-of-court confrontation, photograph,
                            or pretrial identification procedure; and the pretrial photographic procedures were not so unnecessarily suggestive as to lead to irreparable mistaken identification. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 489</cite>,

                            Judge's Recordation of Findings. - Defendant was not prejudiced by any error that might have resulted from a proceeding, conducted after an evidentiary hearing outside the presence of the jury and after the trial court ruled on defendant's suppression
                            motions in open court, in which the judge merely recorded his own observations with the aid of the prosecutor and a witness; the record was silent as to whether the defendant was present or absent. State v. Blakeney,

                            Violation of Confrontation Clause Was Not Shown. - Where defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine both witnesses in his murder trial the confrontation clause was not violated as to the victim's grandmother's testimony concerning what she told the
                            defendant and as to the letter written from the victim to the defendant, authenticated by two witnesses. State v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 675</cite>, 375 S.E.2d 156 (1989).

                            A capital murder defendant's confrontation rights were not prejudicially violated by his absence from an in-chambers conference, where the court allowed the defendant's request to record the trial in its entirety and discussed possible sequestration of
                            certain witnesses, because these discussions did not relate in any material way to the pending charges. State v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 502 S.E.2d 853 (1998), aff'd,

                            Hearsay testimony concerning statements made by a child to a licensed psychological associate during an evaluation interview by a medical center's child sexual abuse team did not violate the defendant's confrontation rights, where the child was found
                            incompetent to testify, and the statements were found to be trustworthy in that they were made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment, and there was no evidence that law enforcement officials were involved in the
                            decision to evaluate the child. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 504 S.E.2d 84 (1998), aff'd in part and modified in part, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 413</cite>,

                            Defendant's confrontation rights under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §

                            under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, Rule 608(b). State v. Oliver, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 584 S.E.2d 86 (2003).

                        <p>
                            There was no error in the limitation on defendant's cross-examination of the victim where the reasons for her unwillingness to testify and the possibility of her being held in contempt did not bear on her credibility or bias toward defendant, nor was
                            whether she believed defendant had been tried "enough" relevant to any matter at issue in the trial. State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 616 S.E.2d 306 (2005).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because defendant's cross-examination was not restricted by law, and the trial court did not limit the scope of the examination, defendant's only limitation in cross-examining the police captain was his inability to play the lost videotape to the jury,
                            and defendant had ample opportunity to cross-examine the captain regarding the quality of the videotape, his viewing of the videotape, and about what he saw on the videotape; defendant's confrontation rights under the Sixth
                            Amendment were vindicated and his right to confrontation under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">

                        <p>
                            Defendant's right to presence was not violated when the trial judge met with the jury to thank them for their service before discharging them because the jury's service was complete at the time; the meeting occurred after the jury had delivered a unanimous
                            verdict, had been polled, and the trial court recorded the verdict. State v. Badgett, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 234</cite>, 644 S.E.2d 206 (2007).

                            Right to confrontation was not violated when the trial court refused to allow defendant to cross-examine a witness regarding the witness's alleged biased because there was no evidence that the witness, an inmate, received concessions for participating
                            in the case against defendant. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 648 S.E.2d 896, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 704</cite>, 653 S.E.2d 878 (2007),

                            Defendant did not show that law enforcement officers' statements identifying defendant by defendant's nickname constituted inadmissible hearsay and, thus, defendant did not show a prerequisite for a Confrontation Clause violation, namely, that hearsay
                            was involved; the law enforcement officers' identification of defendant was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, but instead was admitted to show why their investigation focused on defendant in a case where defendant
                            shot another person. State v. Tate, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 593, 653 S.E.2d 892 (2007).

                            Subpoena defendant served on an out-of-state witness called by the State was invalid because the witness was in North Carolina pursuant to the State's summons and thus, the trial court did not err in releasing the witness after he testified for the State.

                            Defendant's challenge to the admission of recorded phone calls failed because, even if the recordings contained hearsay, the evidence was overwhelming and, thus, there was no possibility of a different outcome had the jury not heard the phone calls, and
                            because the recorded statements made by the women defendant talked to while in jail were not testimonial, the statement's admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause. State v. Roberts, - N.C. App. - , 836 S.E.2d 287

                            Brevity and Reliability of Witness. - Where testifying witness observed defendant during the day, from a short distance, and long enough to notice his unseasonable clothing, witness's identification of him was not too brief and therefore not inherently
                            incredible, and its admittance into evidence was not violative of his due process rights under this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Subject Matter of Bench Conference. - No error where the court documented the subject matter of the bench conference, either at the time of the conference or later in the transcript, and the record demonstrated that none of these conferences implicated
                            defendant's right to confrontation. State v. Harden, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 542</cite>, 476 S.E.2d 658 (1996).

                            Failure of the trial court to grant defendant's requested recess so that defendant could get a bench warrant for a defense witness did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right under the United States Constitution to have compulsory process to obtain
                            witnesses and his right under the North Carolina Constitution to confront his accusers with witnesses and other testimony pursuant to this section. State v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 750</cite>,

                            New Trial Ordered Where Detective Allowed to Read a Witness' Statement Taken During Questioning. - Defendant's confrontation clause rights were violated when a trial court allowed a detective to read into evidence a statement the detective took while
                            questioning a suspect in a stolen goods case; regardless of whether the man was unavailable, the statement was testimonial since it was taken in the course of interrogations and defendant had not had a prior opportunity to
                            cross-examine the man regarding his statements; since that was the State's only evidence showing defendant knew the items he possessed were stolen, the error was not harmless and defendant was entitled to a new trial on charges

         Requested Instructions.
        </b> - In defendant's conviction for robbery with firearm, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's requested jury instructions that the victim had an interest in this case because of pending criminal charges;
                            although the trial court's instruction was more general than defendant's requested instructions, it substantially conformed with defendant's request, and defendant was also allowed to cross-examine the victim regarding the

                            Denial of Continuance Motion. - Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a continuance where the State, in defendant's attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon case, presented defendant with a statement on the morning
                            of trial that it had obtained from the man who had allegedly sold defendant the gun used in the shootings involved in defendant's case; defendant had not shown evidence that he would have been better prepared had the motion
                            to continue been granted or that he was materially prejudiced by the denial of his motion, and defendant was given a recess by the trial court to allow his counsel to interview the man. State v. Bethea,

                            Defendant's constitutional right to presence at trial was not violated by the denial of motions for continuance because defendant's absence from the second and third days of trial was only explained by contact with a defense witness, not defense counsel
                            or the trial court, indicating that defendant was in the hospital with chest pains; a letter indicating that defendant had been in the hospital for observation did not offer a diagnosis or prognosis, and, thus, no medical emergency
                            was shown, so defendant's absence could not be deemed involuntary. State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 625, 655 S.E.2d 887 (2008).

                            Denial of motion for a continuance to secure the attendance and testimony of a sergeant as a necessary and material witness for the defense was not erroneous because defendant did not articulate any specific facts about which the sergeant would testify

                            at random, in open court, and in defendant's presence. State v. Badgett, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 234</cite>, 644 S.E.2d 206 (2007).

                            Harmless Error. - While a trial court found juror misconduct violating defendant's constitutional rights where a juror looked up a drug on the Internet, the trial court properly denied a motion for appropriate relief because the constitutional violation
                            was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where there was no reasonable possibility that the mentioning of the Internet finding could have had an effect on an average juror. State v. Armstrong,

                            Right to Counsel May Be Forfeited - The defendant forfeited his right to counsel and the trial court did not err by requiring him to proceed pro se, without conducting an inquiry pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>,
                            where he was twice appointed counsel as an indigent, each time releasing his appointed counsel and retaining private counsel. Defendant was disruptive in the courtroom on two occasions, refused to cooperate with his counsel
                            and assaulted him, resulting in an additional month's delay in the trial. State v. Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 521, 530 S.E.2d 66 (2000).

                            Trial court may find that a criminal defendant has forfeited the right to counsel. In such a case, the court is not required to follow the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>,
                            which the court would otherwise be required to do before permitting a defendant to proceed pro se. A finding that a defendant has forfeited the right to counsel requires egregious dilatory or abusive conduct on the part of
                            the defendant which undermines the purposes of the right to counsel and prevents the trial court from complying with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>.

                            Absent egregious conduct by the defendant, a defendant must be advised of the right to counsel, the consequences of proceeding without counsel, and the nature of the charges and proceedings and the range of permissible punishments before the defendant
                            can proceed without counsel. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>. Thus, where the defendant's behavior was not so
                            egregious as to prevent the court from proceeding, or to create a danger of any kind, forfeiture of the constitutional right to counsel has not occurred. State v. Simpkins, - N.C. - , 838 S.E.2d 439 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant had not engaged in such serious misconduct as to warrant forfeiture of the right to counsel where his untimely objection, questions, and speaking out of turn for 20 minutes at the start of the proceeding before he was required to proceed pro
                            se, while frustrating to the court, was not so egregious as to frustrate the purposes of the right to counsel. Moreover, nothing in the record suggested that he was rude or disrespectful to the trial court. State v. Simpkins,
                            - N.C. - , 838 S.E.2d 439 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in determining that defendant forfeited his constitutional right to counsel because forfeiture required egregious misconduct that obstructs or delays the proceedings, and nothing in the record indicated that defendant's difficulty cooperating
                            with his two court-appointed attorneys had delayed or obstructed the proceedings. State v. Patterson, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 21, 2020).

                            The rights of communication go with the man into the jail, and reasonable opportunity to exercise them must be afforded by the restraining authorities. The denial of an opportunity to exercise a right is a denial of the right. State v. Hill,

                            A defendant is entitled to consult with friends and relatives and to have them make observations of his person. The right to communicate with counsel and friends necessarily includes the right of access to them. State v. Hill,

                            The fact that a person is a defendant's lawyer, as well as his friend, does not impair his right to see the defendant at a critical time of the proceedings. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d

                            Counsel Must Have Opportunity to Investigate, Prepare and Present Defense. - Since the law regards substance rather than form, the constitutional guaranty of the right of counsel contemplates not only that a person charged with crime shall have the privilege

                            were not violated by eight days' delay in appointment of counsel. State v. Avery, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 459</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 142 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct.

                            When Failure to Grant Continuance is Denial of Effective Assistance. - Where after the convening of the term the trial court ordered a special venire from another county to try defendant for rape, and counsel for defendant challenged the array on the
                            ground that persons of defendant's race had been excluded from the jury list solely because of their race, but the court refused the request of counsel for time to investigate and secure evidence in support of such challenge
                            to the array, although counsel obtained evidence from members of the special venire and bystanders of the courtroom tending to sustain the challenge, it was held that as it appeared that defendant was prejudiced by denial of
                            reasonable opportunity to procure evidence in support of his challenge to the array, a new trial would be awarded for the denial of defendant's constitutional right to be properly represented by counsel. State v. Speller,
                            <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 345</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 294 (1949).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unless counsel suggests the existence of material witnesses or information that would possibly lead to material evidence or material witnesses, the mere failure to grant a continuance in order to make an investigation would not, in and of itself, constitute
                            a denial of effective assistance of counsel. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759 (1978).

                            In a prosecution for kidnapping and assaulting a policeman with a firearm, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a continuance where the 17 days defendant's counsel had to prepare for trial was not a reasonable time under the circumstances.
                            State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 251 S.E.2d 647, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 178</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 39 (1979).

                        <p>
                            The defendant was entitled to a new trial because the court's denials of his repeated motions for a continuance resulted in a violation of his constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel, to confront his accusers, and to due process of law.
                            Defendant's counsels had only thirty-four days to prepare for a complex, bifurcated capital case, involving multiple incidents in multiple locations over a two-day period, which they took over from another attorney who had
                            done little other than filing pretrial motions while trying to persuade the defendant to accept a plea bargain. No evidence existed that any witness interviews had been performed; the orders based on the trial court's rulings
                            on pretrial motions had not been prepared; and a jury questionnaire was not submitted for distribution to prospective jurors. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 119</cite>, 529 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err or violate defendant's constitutional rights in denying defendant's motion for a continuance to permit defendant to procure an expert witness to evaluate and testify as to the State of North Carolina's DNA evidence because defendant
                            had sufficient time to review the evidence against defendant and to procure the assistance of an expert, but simply failed to do so in time. State v. King, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite>                            390, 742 S.E.2d 315 (2013).

                            There are no set rules to determine whether a defendant has been deprived of effective assistance of counsel; rather each case must be approached upon an ad hoc basis, viewing circumstances as a whole in order to determine this question. State v. Hensley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 231</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 332 (1978).

                        <p>
                            The question of inadequacy of representation cannot be determined solely upon the amount of time counsel spends with the accused or upon the intensiveness of his investigation. State v. Sneed, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 606</cite>,
                            201 S.E.2d 867 (1974).

                        <p>
                            Test of effective assistance of counsel is whether the assistance given was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. State v. Vickers, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 90</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 599
                            (1982); State v. Scober, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 328 S.E.2d 590 (1985).

                        <p>
                            The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel's conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial could not be relied on as having produced a just result. State v. Dockery,
                            <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 336 S.E.2d 719 (1985).

                            Farce and Mockery of Justice Test. - The incompetency of counsel for the defendant in a criminal prosecution is not a constitutional denial of his right to effective counsel unless the attorney's representation is so lacking that the trial has become
                            a farce and a mockery of justice. State v. Sneed, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 606</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 867 (1974); State v. Mathis, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 660</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 245 (1977);

                            Breach of Attorneys' Duty Does Not Automatically Require Reversal. - The duties of an attorney representing a criminal defendant include the duty of loyalty, a duty to advocate defendant's cause, and the duty to consult with defendant, investigate defendant's
                            case and keep defendant informed. However, a breach of one of these duties does not automatically require reversal of defendant's conviction. Defendant must also demonstrate that the professionally unreasonable conduct of his
                            counsel resulted in prejudice to defendant. State v. Dockery, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 336 S.E.2d 719 (1985).

                            For case upholding finding of fact that defendant's counsel was not ineffective but that if he was, defendant did not show any prejudice, see State v. Swann, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 666</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 533 (1988).

                            Appointment on Day Before Trial. - It is not ipso facto a denial of effective assistance because counsel were notified of their appointment and on the same day learned that the cases would be called for trial the following day. State v. Alderman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 14, 212 S.E.2d 205 (1972), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 433 (1975).

                            Conflict of Interest. - Defendant's rights under the Sixth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span> 19 and 23 were not violated by the denial of defense counsel's motion to withdraw since an inquiry was conducted into counsel's allegation that counsel had a conflict of interest under N.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct
                            1.7(a) because a former client was called as a witness against defendant; there was no conflict since: (1) counsel had represented the witness three years prior to defendant's trial and was no longer representing the witness;
                            (2) counsel had no recollection as to specifics of the witness's case aside from the fact that the witness had been convicted; (3) counsel's statement that counsel would review counsel's file to see if counsel had any information
                            to help defendant proved that counsel was committed to defendant's case; and (4) counsel made significant inroads to undermine the witness's credibility. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 651

                            As defendant was effectively forced to go to trial while represented by trial counsel who had previously represented one of the State's witnesses and who acknowledged being in the possession of confidential information which might be useful for purposes
                            of cross-examining that witness, defendant was entitled to a new trial. State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 431, 736 S.E.2d 837 (2013), review denied, 747 S.E.2d 534, 2013 N.C.

                            Physical Incapacity. - The question of effective assistance of counsel involving the physical incapacity of counsel does not turn on the physical incapacity of counsel as such, since this may or may not deprive a defendant of effective representation.
                            Rather, it is necessary to examine counsel's specific acts or omissions. The reviewing court must approach such questions ad hoc and in each case view the circumstances as a whole. State v. Richards,

                            Improper Mitigating Factors Tendered. - The defendant's right to present a complete defense, including evidence of mitigating circumstances, pursuant to this section, was not violated by the exclusion of friend of defendant's statement regarding the effect
                            defendant's death would have on him; a third party's feelings are irrelevant to the capital sentencing proceeding. State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 122</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 334 (2000),

                            Denial of Continuance to Prepare Closing Argument. - Defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel was not denied when the trial court refused to continue the trial to give the defendant's counsel the weekend to prepare a closing argument for the
                            guilt-innocence determination phase of the trial; defense counsel's closing argument met an objective standard of reasonableness and was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in capital cases. State v. Laws,

                            Admission of Testimony of Second Psychiatric Examination. - Defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel was not violated by admission of second treatment team's testimony as to information obtained during second court-ordered psychiatric examination,
                            even though that admission was for the purpose of determining his capacity to proceed, as opposed to his sanity at the time of the crime; defendant had the opportunity to discuss with his lawyer whether or not to submit to
                            the second court-ordered examination and to discuss its scope as well, and the absence of express language in the second order specifying defendant's examination to determine his mental state at the time of the offenses was
                            not significant. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777

                            In a murder prosecution, the admission of psychiatric testimony as to defendant's mental state at the time of the crime did not affect his right to counsel because he had placed his mental condition in issue when he moved to continue the trial due to
                            his psychiatric illness and asserted the defense of diminished capacity and inability to formulate the intent to kill, and he had the opportunity to consult with counsel concerning the scope of the examination conducted by
                            the testifying psychiatrist. State v. McClary, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 577 S.E.2d 690, appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 466</cite>, 586 S.E.2d

                            Trial Court Hearings on Effectiveness of Counsel. - The trial judge, who actually sees the lawyer's behavior, is better able than an appellate court to evaluate the overall effectiveness of representation. State v. Richards,

                            Because defendant did not waive her right to conflict free counsel, she argued that she claimed possession of the heroin and the paraphernalia to protect her boyfriend, and because he was represented by defense counsel's boss, there was a potential for
                            a conflict under N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(a); thus, a hearing should have been held. State v. Mims, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 637 S.E.2d 244 (2006).

                            Decision Not to Introduce Evidence. - The trial court's deferral of its ruling on whether introduction of certain evidence by defendant would open the door to permit the State to introduce irrelevant and prejudicial evidence about defendant's prior convictions
                            did not improperly chill the defendant's rights to introduce evidence; his decision not to introduce the evidence was purely tactical and did not implicate any rights. State v. Holman, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 174</cite>,

                            Ineffective Representation Shown. - The counsel's substandard performance was prejudicial to the rape defendant, where the defense's failure to produce any evidence to support the theories proffered at the outset of the trial, including consent of the
                            victim and inability of the defendant to perform the alleged acts, formed the basis of one of the principal closing arguments made by the State in favor of conviction. State v. Moorman, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 387</cite>,

                            Defendant was denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel because (1) defendant showed counsel was objectively unreasonable when counsel did not raise dispositive authority establishing that the trial court's disjunctive jury instruction on a
                            charge of possession of a weapon by a felon was plain error, including an improper acting in concert instruction, when it was impossible for an appellate court to determine on which of two theories in the instruction defendant
                            was convicted, and (2) defendant showed prejudice from counsel's error denying defendant the opportunity to have the case decided on the merits and a reasonable probability that, had appellate counsel cited the dispositive
                            authority, defendant would have been granted a new trial. State v. Collington, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 127, 814 S.E.2d 874 (2018), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 792</cite>,

                            Appellate counsel's performance was deficient in failing to challenge the trial court's findings of fact regarding the detectives' knowledge of the vehicle's inspection status at the time of the initial stop because it was not a strategic decision but
                            rather was an oversight. Defendant was prejudiced because had counsel challenged the findings there was a reasonable probability that the court would have concluded that the finding that the stop was initiated because of the
                            inspection violation was not supported by competent evidence as the detectives could not have known that the vehicle's inspection was expired at the time the vehicle was stopped. State v. Baskins,

                            Defendant's Burden to Show Ineffectiveness of Counsel. - Defendant's first degree murder conviction for stabbing his wife to death was affirmed because defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel as he did not meet his burden of showing
                            a reasonable probability that, but for defense counsel's failure to raise an issue at trial, the result of his proceedings would have been different. State v.

                            Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed because defendant failed to satisfy his burden that there was a reasonable probability that a different outcome would have occurred if counsel had presented additional evidence of defendant's

                            Appointment of Counsel for Limited Purpose of Furnishing Advice. - Defendant was not prejudiced in any respect by the appointment of counsel for the limited purpose of furnishing advice to him if so requested, even though defendant did waive counsel and
                            conducted his own defense. State v. Harper, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 30, 202 S.E.2d 795, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 375</cite>, 205 S.E.2d 100 (1974).

                            a new trial where there was no objection at the time the evidence was offered, applies equally to an unrepresented nonindigent defendant. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 322</cite>,

                            A defendant is entitled to counsel at every critical stage of the proceedings against him. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).

                            Although a defendant is granted a general right to counsel to assist in his or her defense, that right does not attach to all events leading to trial. The right attaches only to "critical" stages of the proceedings, those proceedings where the presence
                            of counsel is necessary to assure a meaningful defense. State v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 163</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 352, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 587 (1981),

                            Determining When Proceeding Is a Critical Stage. - In deciding whether a particular proceeding constitutes a critical stage, courts must focus their inquiry on whether the presence of counsel is necessary to preserve the defendant's basic right to a fair
                            trial as affected by his right to meaningfully cross-examine the witnesses against him and to have effective assistance of counsel at the trial itself. State v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 163</cite>,

                            The guarantee of counsel only applies to "critical stages" of the prosecution, and what constitutes a critical stage is determined both from the nature of the proceedings and from the facts in each case. State v. Hall,

                            In Connection with Right to Testify. - Defendant was improperly forced to choose between testifying in defendant's own behalf or being represented by counsel at trial; by choosing to testify, defendant was forced to relinquish defendant's constitutional
                            right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art. I,

                        <p>
                            Because defendant's initial forfeiture did not carry over to his resentencing hearing, and a new inquiry conducted pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>                            was required for defendant to properly waive the right to counsel at the resentencing hearing; since no such inquiry occurred, defendant was deprived of the right to counsel at the resentencing hearing and was entitled to be
                            resentenced. State v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 697 S.E.2d 392 (2010).

                            Identification in One-Man Showup Conducted at Victim's Home. - The trial court properly admitted a burglary victim's in-court identification of defendant and evidence of the victim's identification of defendant in a one-man showup conducted at the victim's
                            home within an hour after the crime and at a time when defendant was without counsel and had not waived counsel since (1) defendant was not entitled to counsel at the one-man showup because he was not in custody, (2) there
                            was no reasonable possibility that the one-man showup could have led to a mistaken identification or contributed to defendant's conviction, and (3) the in-court identification of defendant by the victim was independent in origin
                            and was not influenced by the showup. State v. Tann, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 89</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 720 (1981).

                        <p>
                            Lineup. - Accused is constitutionally guaranteed counsel at an in-custody lineup identification. When counsel is not present at the lineup, testimony of witnesses that they identified the accused at the lineup is rendered inadmissible, and any in-court
                            identification is also rendered inadmissible, unless the trial judge first determines on a voir dire hearing that the in-court identification is of independent origin and is untainted by the illegal lineup. State v. Ingram,
                            <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 35, 200 S.E.2d 417 (1973).

                            Examination of Photographs. - Right to counsel's presence is not extended to out-of-court examinations of photographs which include a suspect, whether he is in custody or at liberty. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>,

                        <p>
                            An accused has no constitutional right to the presence of counsel when eyewitnesses are viewing photographs for purposes of identification, and this is true regardless of whether the suspect is at liberty or in custody at the time. State v. Miller,

                            Probable Cause Hearing. - A probable cause hearing is a "critical stage" of the criminal process entitling an indigent person to appointed counsel if he desires assistance of counsel. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>,

                            Where defendant had waived his right to have assigned counsel at the preliminary hearing, but made a specific request for a lawyer prior to the selection of the jury at his trial in the superior court, he was entitled to be represented by counsel. State

                            Although the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant's counsel to examine the questions that the jury posed in defendant's murder trial, the circumstances did not completely deprive defendant of counsel; after the trial court received the questions,
                            the trial court merely repeated the original jury instructions that it had given and did not give any new instructions. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 654 S.E.2d

                            What Constitutes Critical Stage Where Offense Involves Intoxication. - A critical stage has been reached in a defendant's case when, immediately after officers have interrogated the defendant and conducted their test for sobriety, they charge him with
                            the offense of driving while intoxicated. The denial of counsel at this point makes it impossible for a defendant to have disinterested witnesses observe his condition and to obtain a blood test by a doctor - the only means
                            by which defendant might prove his innocence. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A defendant's guilt or innocence of driving while intoxicated depends upon whether he is intoxicated at the time of his arrest. His condition then is the crucial and decisive fact to be proven. Permission to communicate with counsel and friends is of
                            no avail if those who come to the jail in response to a prisoner's call are not permitted to see for themselves whether he is intoxicated. In this situation, the right of a defendant to communicate with counsel and friends
                            implies, at the very least, the right to have them see him, observe and examine him, with reference to his alleged intoxication. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d

                            Trial for Misdemeanors. - Defendant was not denied his constitutional right to counsel by failure of the trial court to appoint counsel to represent him in the consolidated trial of two misdemeanors, where neither offense was a serious offense, notwithstanding
                            the fact that the maximum punishment for the two offenses could have been seven months. State v. Speights, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 182 S.E.2d 204, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 137</cite>,

                            It is a cardinal principle of criminal law that an indigent defendant has the right under U.S. Const., Amend. VI to assistance of counsel for his defense. State v. Luker, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 532, 310 S.E.2d

                            Statute Making Appointment of Counsel for Indigents Discretionary Held Unconstitutional. - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html#t15a01s15-4.1" target="_blank">G.S. 15-4.1</a></cite>, insofar as it purported
                            to leave to the discretion of the trial judge the appointment of counsel for indigent defendants charged with serious offenses, was unconstitutional. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245
                            (1969).

                            The trial judge must make an express finding as to defendant's indigency or lack of indigency. State v. Pickens, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 200 S.E.2d 405 (1973).

                        <p>
                            Where defendant is charged with a serious crime, it is important for the trial judge to determine in the first instance the question of indigency and for the record to show whether lack of counsel results from indigency or choice. State v. Morris,
                            <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969).

                            Absence of Standards. - The theory that right to counsel has been denied because of absence of definite standards for determining indigency has been rejected by the Court of Appeals. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite>                            379, 219 S.E.2d 277 (1975).

                            When Defendant Prejudiced by Insufficient Inquiry. - Although it was incumbent upon the trial court to make a more sufficient inquiry into defendant's financial status and to determine the question of his indigency, defendant was not prejudiced unless
                            he could show that he did not voluntarily and intelligently waive counsel. State v. Pickens, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 200 S.E.2d 405 (1973).

                            Indigent Defendant May Waive Right to Counsel. - The purpose of the statutory provision for appointment of counsel, at public expense, for indigent defendants is to put indigent defendants on an equality with affluent defendants in trials upon criminal
                            charges. To deny, or to restrict the right of the indigent to waive counsel, i.e., to represent himself, while permitting the affluent defendant to exercise such right, has no reasonable relation to the objective of equal opportunity
                            to prevail at the trial of the case. Such classification is beyond the power of the legislature. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).

                            Defendant may Represent Himself. - A defendant in a criminal proceeding has a right to handle his own case without interference by, or the assistance of, counsel forced upon him against his wishes. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>,
                            190 S.E.2d 164 (1972); State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 211 S.E.2d 539 (1975), overruled on other grounds, State v. Barnes, 3<cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 380 S.E.2d 118 (1989).

                            A defendant on the trial of a criminal case, including a coram nobis proceeding at which the defendant is present and witnesses are to be examined and cross-examined, has a right to conduct and manage his own case pro se. The right to act pro se is a
                            right arising out of the federal Constitution and not the mere product of legislation or judicial decision. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).

                            Revocation of Waiver of Appointed Counsel. - Trial court did not err when the court allowed defendant to be represented by counsel because there was no evidence that the trial court expressly forced appointed counsel on defendant; after defendant voluntarily
                            revoked his waiver of appointed counsel and informed the trial court that he would no longer represent himself but would be represented by his court-appointed attorney, the trial court ensured that representation by the court-appointed
                            attorney was fully defendant's choice before the court appointed defense counsel. State v. Worrell, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 660 S.E.2d 183, appeal dismissed, review denied,

                            Request for Substitution of New Counsel. - Trial court's denial of defendant's request to have appointed counsel removed was not error, because appointed counsel was an experienced attorney and defendant's disagreements as to trial strategy and defense
                            counsel's questioning on cross-examination was not sufficient to render counsel's assistance ineffective. State v. Glenn, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 143, 726 S.E.2d 185 (2012).

                            Condition of probation requiring the defendant to reimburse the State for costs of court-appointed counsel does not infringe upon defendant's constitutional right to counsel.

                            Facts Held Insufficient to Sustain Finding of Nonindigency. - The fact that the defendant was a painter capable of earning $60.00 per week when he was able to obtain work and that he had made little, if any, effort to secure counsel, either privately
                            or by court appointment, was not sufficient to sustain a finding that he was not indigent at the time of trial and, therefore, not entitled to a court-appointed attorney when one was requested at the trial. State v. Haire,

                            Defendant was deprived of the constitutional right to self-representation because defendant was not allowed to represent himself despite the fact that the record showed that defendant was competent, understood, and voluntarily exercised his free will,
                            the trial court clearly expressed its that opinion it would be mistake for defendant to represent himself and warned defendant he would have to "play by the rules." State v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                            285, 641 S.E.2d 758 (2007).

                            Right to Counsel May Be Waived. - A defendant in a criminal proceeding, whether at trial or in pretrial proceedings, may waive his right to counsel if he does so freely and understandingly and with full knowledge. State v. Cobb,
                            <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759 (1978); State v. Hyatt, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 513 S.E.2d 90 (1999).

                            First degree felony murder and conspiracy to commit robbery with dangerous weapon convictions were affirmed since the trial court's decision to admit a videotape of the defendant's post-Miranda interrogation was properly based on substantial evidence
                            that he (1) signed a waiver of, and (2) never made a clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal assertion of his right to counsel, and did not assert his right to remain silent.

                            Defendant Need Not Know the Source of the Right Before Waiving It. - The court disagreed with contention by the defendant that in order to waive his right to counsel a defendant must have explained to him his right to counsel under U.S. Const., Amend.
                            VI and under this section. If a defendant is told he has a right to counsel, as the defendant was, he does not have to know the precise source of the right before waiving it. State v. Palmer,

                            What Record Must Show on Waiver. - The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver. State v. Morris,

                            Defendant was granted a new trial on his indictment for habitual felon status because, despite defendant's dissatisfaction with his prior counsel and clearly-stated desire to proceed pro se, the trial court erred by failing to conduct an inquiry as required

                            Duty of Court to Determine If Defendant Has Waived Right to Counsel. - The constitutional right of an accused to be represented by counsel invokes, of itself, the protection of the trial court, which imposes the serious and weighty responsibility upon
                            the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver of counsel by the accused. While an accused may waive the right to counsel, whether there is a proper waiver should be clearly determined by
                            the trial court, and it would be fitting and appropriate for that determination to appear upon the record. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969).

                            When the voir dire evidence is conflicting and contradictory on the question of whether a defendant waived his right to counsel, it is incumbent upon the trial judge to weigh the credibility of the witnesses, resolve the crucial conflicts and make appropriate
                            findings of fact. State v. Biggs, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 522</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 371 (1976).

                            Trial court did not err in allowing defendant to represent himself because the court complied with the statutory requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>                            and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIXa36s7A-457" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-457</a></cite> prior to allowing such self-representation; its inquiry that satisfied those provisions fully satisfied the
                            constitutional requirement that any waiver of counsel be knowing and voluntary. State v. Davis, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - , cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 170</cite>, 568 S.E.2d 623 (2002).

                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 23 that defendant's decision to proceed pro se was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made because: (1) defendant did not show that defendant appreciated the consequences of proceeding without counsel, or
                            that defendant understood that murder was punishable by death; (2) it was not sufficient that defendant agreed that defendant had been afforded excellent legal counsel, or that defendant claimed the decision was made without
                            "haste" and was "something that (defendant had) thought about for quite some time"; and (3) that defendant's responses were clear and succinct and that defendant was calm and revealed no sign of confusion, reticence, or hesitation
                            could not substitute for the required inquiry. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 319</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 722 (2008).

                        <p>
                            Defendant was granted a new trial because the trial court failed to determine whether he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to counsel as required under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>;
                            defendant's waiver of counsel at his first district court appearance was insufficient to constitute a valid waiver of counsel at his subsequent trial because at that time, defendant had not yet been indicted, and thus, defendant
                            was not informed of the charges for which he was indicted such that his waiver was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 721 S.E.2d 233 (2011), aff'd

                            Waiver Inquiry Inadequate. - Trial court erred in permitting defendant to waive counsel and proceed pro se at a probation revocation hearing without first satisfying the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>.
                            Nothing in the record or transcript indicated that defendant understood and appreciated the consequences of his decision to proceed pro se or comprehended the nature of charges and proceedings and the range of possible punishments.

                            Defendant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the trial court failed to ensure that he validly waived his right to counsel prior to the resentencing hearing, as after defendant stated he wished to proceed pro se, the trial court only requested
                            that he sign a form waiving his right to counsel and conducted no further inquiry before proceeding with the hearing. State v. Doisey, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (May 4, 2021).

                            Affirmative Showing of Waiver by State. - When the State seeks to offer in evidence a defendant's in-custody statements, made in response to police interrogation and in the absence of counsel, the State must affirmatively show not only that the defendant
                            was fully informed of his rights but also that he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. State v. Biggs, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 522</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 371 (1976).

                            Motion or Request to Withdraw Waiver of Counsel Not Shown. - Criminal defendant's statements during trial that because he did not have an attorney he did not know how to question jurors or prepare an opening statement did not equate to a motion or request
                            to withdraw his previous waiver of counsel. State v. Hyatt, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 513 S.E.2d 90 (1999).

                            Right to Counsel Held Waived. - Even though counsel was appointed for defendant, he waived the right to have counsel when he initiated a conversation and volunteered statements to investigators without being questioned; neither his Fifth Amendment nor
                            his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and his statements were properly admitted at his trial. State v. Boggess, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 676</cite>, 600 S.E.2d 453 (2004).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was no error to let defendant proceed pro se at a probation revocation hearing because (1) the court explained the charges, proceedings, and possible sentence and explained defendant's right to assigned counsel, in response to which defendant clearly
                            and unequivocally asked to represent himself, (2) defendant said he understood the consequences of representing himself, and (3) he was 23 years old, spoke English, had a G.E.D., had attended college, had no known mental defects,
                            and did not have to navigate complex evidentiary or procedural rules. State v. Faulkner, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 792 S.E.2d 836 (2016).

                        <p>
                            Defendant's constitutional rights to counsel were not violated because the trial court determined defendant elected to proceed pro se as defendant signed waiver of counsel forms and the court gave defendant years to find an attorney, advised and counseled
                            defendant about the right to an attorney including the right to appointed counsel, counseled defendant on the complexity of handling a jury trial, and addressed the seriousness of the charges and advised defendant a conviction
                            likely meant a life sentence. State v. Schumann, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 866, 810 S.E.2d 379 (2018), review denied, 811 S.E.2d 590, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 252 (2018).

                        <p>
                            Forfeiture of Right to Counsel. - Defendant, who appeared before at least four judges in 14 months, hired and fired counsel twice, was briefly represented by a public defender, refused to indicate his wishes with respect to counsel, advanced unsupported
                            legal theories concerning jurisdiction, and claimed not to understand anything other than what was said on jurisdiction, and engaged in purposeful conduct and tactics to delay and frustrate the orderly process of the trial
                            courts that resulted in a forfeiture of his right to counsel. State v. Mee, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 756 S.E.2d 103 (2014).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although defendant did not waive the right to counsel, defendant's refusal to answer whether he wanted assistance of counsel at three separate pretrial hearings and his repeated and vigorous objection to the trial court's authority to proceed amounted
                            to willful obstruction and delay of trial proceedings and, therefore, defendant forfeited his right to counsel. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 768 S.E.2d 896 (2015).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court violated defendant's constitutional right to counsel by requiring him to represent himself where he neither voluntarily waived his right to be represented by counsel nor engaged in such serious misconduct as to warrant forfeiture of his right
                            to counsel without any warning that he would be required to represent himself or an inquiry under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>                            to ensure that he understood the consequences of self-representation. The record showed that defendant was uniformly polite and cooperative, he did not deny the trial court's jurisdiction, disrupt court proceedings, or behave
                            offensively, and he did not hire and fire multiple attorneys or repeatedly delay the trial. State v. Blakeney, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 452, 782 S.E.2d 88 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant forfeited defendant's right to court-appointed counsel because defendant's failure to hire defendant's own counsel over a period of years resulted in repeated delays in the case proceeding to trial. State v. Schumann,
                            <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 866, 810 S.E.2d 379 (2018), review denied, 811 S.E.2d 590, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 252 (2018).

                        <p>
                            Defendant had to receive a new trial because he did not forfeit his right to counsel by engaging in serious misconduct or dilatory tactics after having been warned of the consequences as defendant was not combative or rude; there was no indication defendant
                            had ever previously requested the case to be continued; and, as a whole, defendant's arguments did not appear to be designed to delay or obstruct the proceedings but overall reflected his lack of knowledge or understanding
                            of the legal process. State v. Simpkins, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 325, 826 S.E.2d 845 (2019), aff'd, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 98 (N.C. 2020).

                        <p>
                            No forfeiture of right to counsel. - Defendant did not forfeit his right to counsel, and the trial court deprived him of his right to counsel by denying his request to activate his standby counsel and therefore he was entitled to a new trial, because
                            he twice requested appointment of substitute standby counsel, the trial court instead attempted to complete the colloquy required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>,
                            defendant clearly and unequivocally stated that he wished to waive his right to represent himself rather than waive his right to counsel, and stated no fewer than five times that he did not wish to represent himself at trial.

                            Failure to Request Lesser Included Offense in Jury Instruction. - Defense counsel's decision not to request a charge on common law robbery as a lesser included offense to a charge of robbery with a deadly weapon was not ineffective assistance of counsel
                            because that decision was a viable "all or nothing" trial strategy in which counsel hoped that the jury would find one element of the crime missing and then find defendants not guilty; counsel reasonably used that strategy
                            in an attempt to preserve defendants' military careers, and the fact that the strategy failed did not mean defendants received ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite>                            110, 605 S.E.2d 647 (2004).

                            Defense counsel's negative remarks about defendant's intelligence and decision making, at the sentencing hearing, did not amount to ineffective assistance, but were an attempt to show that defendant was not mentally capable of making an informed, reasoned
                            decision and thus, should not be harshly sentenced. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 770, 607 S.E.2d 5 (2005).

                            Prejudice Not Shown. - Even if counsel was ineffective by failing to file an affidavit with the suppression motion or to support the pretrial motions with citation to legal authority, defendant could not show prejudice, given that the trial court reached
                            the correct result on the suppression motion and that defendant was not prejudiced by the admission of the surveillance video. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 544, 803

                            Counsel's Strategic Decisions. - Applying the Wiggins test, North Carolina Supreme Court found that counsel for a death-sentenced defendant was not shown to be ineffective because counsel (1) was not under a mandate to second-guess two mental health experts
                            that opined that certain tests were not necessary to determine whether the defendant had brain damage that would have indicated a murder was not intentional or indicated a mitigator, (2) had interviewed other persons regarding
                            the defendant's behavior patterns to assist in formulating his own opinion, and (3) took into consideration that that particular brain injury defense was not proven to be effective based on the result of the first trial in
                            which the defendant also received a death sentence; the highest court concluded that the counsel did not prematurely abandon a defense based on organic brain damage and that their election to pursue a defense/mitigation strategy
                            predicated on other grounds constituted a reasonable professional judgment. State v. Frogge, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 228</cite>, 607 S.E.2d 627 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Defendant did not show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, as counsel's decision to ask a witness about out-of-court statements made by defendant's cousin was a tactical decision, which an appellate court would not second guess. State

                            Counsel's decision to pursue a theory of sexual asphyxiation or accident instead of suicide was a defense strategy that could not be second-guessed on appeal. State v. Scanlon, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. App.</cite> 410,

                            Defense counsel's decision to address defendant's repeated lies to defense counsel and others was a prudent stop in pulling the sting from damaging evidence and did not amount to ineffective assistance. State v. Campbell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 629 S.E.2d 345 (2006).

                        <p>
                            Defendant convicted of voluntary manslaughter did not show that defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 23 and, thus, defendant was not entitled to a reversal of defendant's convictions. Although defendant claimed that counsel's performance was deficient, defendant could not show that defendant did not receive a fair
                            trial, as the claimed deficiencies involved either trial tactics, which were entitled to great deference on appeal, or matters that did not affect the outcome of the trial. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite>                            754, 671 S.E.2d 545 (2009), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 379</cite>, 679 S.E.2d 840 (2009).

                            Where defendant was charged with first degree murder under the felony murder rule, trial counsel's alleged admissions of fact did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel made the challenged admissions of fact with defendant's
                            consent and defendant expressly consented to counsel's strategy of attempting to persuade the jury that defendant neither intended to kill nor actually killed the murder victim. State v. Pemberton,

                            Failure to Request Jury Instructions. - Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel for counsel's failure to request jury instructions where it was determined that the trial court did not commit error in failing to instruct the jury on
                            those offenses; moreover, defendant was acquitted on two of the five charges submitted to the jury, so he was not prejudiced by counsel's performance. State v. Dickens, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>                            632, 592 S.E.2d 567 (2004).

                        <p>
                            As defendant's denial of his pointing of any gun was inconsistent with the defenses of necessity or justification, defendant's attorney made a tactical decision to present a theory of defense based upon defendant's own statements to police; as such, defense
                            counsel's decision not to request jury instructions on necessity and justification with respect to a charge of assault by pointing a gun could not be ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Langley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 194, 618 S.E.2d 253 (2005), cert. dismissed, and denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 366</cite>, 630 S.E.2d 447 (2006).

                        <p>
                            Because there was no plain error in the failure to provide a voluntary intoxication instruction to the jury, defendant's assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect thereto failed; defendant's evidence concerning his low I.Q., smoking
                            marijuana, and sharing alcohol over the course of an evening was not so overwhelming as to render the lack of a voluntary intoxication instruction prejudicial. State v. Andrews, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite>                            68, 612 S.E.2d 178 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Failure to Make Proper Motions. - Defendant's contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel moved for a mistrial as opposed to a new trial or appropriate relief after the jury had already returned its verdict failed where
                            defendant failed to show any prejudice resulting from counsel's failure to make the proper motion. State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 31, 591 S.E.2d 917 (2004).

                        <p>
                            Defendant did not show counsel's assistance was ineffective for not arguing a warrantless blood draw's constitutionality because defendant showed no prejudice, as (1) defendant could be convicted based on an officer's opinion of appreciable impairment,
                            and (2) evidence of impairment aside from the blood draw was overwhelming. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 802 S.E.2d 566, review denied, 807 S.E.2d 568, 2017 N.C.

                            Failure to Object to Chain of Custody. - Where defendant was convicted of raping a 13-year-old female, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to stipulate to the chain of custody of the products of conception to avoid introducing them into evidence;
                            any error was harmless as there was no reasonable probability that the alleged error affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Watts, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 616 S.E.2d 290

                        <p>
                            Failure to Object to Sentence. - Where defendant was sentenced within the presumptive range as a Level VI habitual felon, because he was given a very favorable plea bargain in which twenty-one felony offenses were consolidated for judgment with the original
                            ten felony offenses such that defendant received no additional time for these twenty-one felonies, his sentence was upheld pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIIa81Bs15A-1340.12" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1340.12</a></cite>,
                            and counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the sentence as violative of the Eighth Amendment and on grounds that legislative policy considerations constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Cummings,

                        <p>
                            Stipulation to Facts. - Mere fact that the State asked defendant to stipulate to a prior felony that did not correspond to the prior felony stated in the indictment did not render the error a substantive evidentiary one attributable to the State; instead,
                            the record revealed an intention by defense counsel, after conferring with defendant, to stipulate to a prior felony and an assumption by the State that the stipulation relieved it of the burden of establishing that element
                            of the possession of a firearm by a felon charge. State v. Mason, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 206, 620 S.E.2d 285 (2005).

                            Disclosure of Potentially Incriminating Information. - Under the unique and difficult circumstances here, with the already heavily incriminating evidence against defendant, as well as the apparent likelihood that the discovery of further incriminating
                            evidence could be imminent, the attorneys' decision to disclose potentially incriminating information as to the location of the minor victim with the sought-after goal of avoiding imposition of the death penalty did not fall
                            below an objective standard of reasonableness. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 198</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 797 (2018).

                        <p>
                            Defendant failed to identify anything that one attorney's allegedly inadequate investigation failed to uncover and that would have had any effect on the reasonableness of his attorneys' strategic decision to make the disclosure of the location of the
                            minor victim, which was made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options; ineffective assistance was not shown. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 198</cite>,

                            Failure to Move for Dismissal. - Counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to dismiss the charge of first-degree burglary and the lesser included offenses at the close of evidence, as the victim's testimony that she was awakened by the loud noise
                            of someone kicking the front door and that two men were standing over her father with guns in the room where the door was located, was sufficient evidence to show a breaking and entering took place. State v. Andujar,
                            <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 636 S.E.2d 584 (2006).

                        <p>
                            Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to make a motion to dismiss the robbery charge and the lesser included offenses because there was testimony that defendant told a witness that he and a friend had committed a robbery of some Mexicans and about
                            some of the specifics of the way the crime was committed. State v. Andujar, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 636 S.E.2d 584 (2006).

                            Failure to Object to Questioning. - Where a prosecutor, during cross-examination in a second-degree murder trial, questioned defendant on the reason for omitting certain important facts from a voluntary discussion with a deputy, counsel's failure to object
                            did not constitute ineffective assistance. State v. Ezzell, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 417, 642 S.E.2d 274, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 432</cite>,

                            Failure to Object to Probation Condition. - Defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to a special condition of probation because it could not be said that the outcome of the probation revocation hearing would have been any different
                            had counsel for defendant objected to the condition of probation. State v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 646 S.E.2d 622 (2007), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 240</cite>,

                            Failure to Object to Testimony. Defendant's counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel by not renewing an objection to the admissibility of a statement that defendant made to the defendant's spouse regarding the killing of the victim; the
                            statement did not involve a confidential communication pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008.html#t08a07s8-57ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 8-57(c)</a></cite> because it was made
                            within the hearing of a third person and, thus, the statement was admissible. State v. Kirby, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 367, 653 S.E.2d 174 (2007), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 241</cite>,

                            Trial counsel's failure to object to repeated characterizations of the police informant as a confidential and reliable informant (CI) and counsel's use of that designation did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel as defendant did not show
                            prejudice since the State proved its case using a video recording of the controlled buy of narcotics by the CI showing the pill bottle and the money that exchanged hands, and did not rely on the credibility of the CI. State

                            Trial counsel's failure to object to hearsay and lay opinion that characterized a confidential informant (CI) as a prescription medication addict who was not a potential threat to other people but characterized defendant as a drug dealer who posed a greater
                            threat to other people did not constitute ineffective assistance as defendant did not show prejudice since the State proved its case using a video recording of the controlled buy of narcotics by the CI showing the pill bottle

                            Failure to Object to Admission of Prior Conviction. - Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel when defendant's trial lawyer agreed to stipulate that defendant had a prior felony conviction, without insisting that the nature of the conviction
                            not be disclosed to the jury, as defendant failed to prove that the prior conviction, possession of cocaine, equated with the charges of possession of a firearm by a felon and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious
                            bodily injury such that the jury was likely to have believed that if defendant possessed cocaine in the past, defendant was likely to have committed the charged offenses.

                            Failure to Provide Notice of Intended Defenses. - Defendant failed to meet the burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel by counsel failing to provide notice of defendant's intended defenses at trial because there was no reasonable probability
                            that the alleged error of counsel affected the outcome of the trial as defendant failed to present substantial evidence of either voluntary intoxication or diminished capacity. State v. McDonald,

                            Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel, when defendant was convicted of both second-degree rape and statutory rape predicated on a single act of sexual intercourse with the victim, because defendant could not have been prejudiced
                            by ineffective assistance of counsel when a double jeopardy argument would have been unsuccessful at trial, as neither of the offenses was a lesser included offense of the other based on the separate and distinct elements that
                            had to be proven. State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 652</cite>, 766 S.E.2d 334 (2014).

                            Counsel Not Ineffective. - Since the trial court did not err in its jury instructions and there was no fatal variance, trial counsel was not ineffective for consenting to the jury instructions or in failing to argue that there was fatal variance between
                            the allegations in the indictment and the evidence presented. State v. Nickens, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 821 S.E.2d 864 (2018).

                            Counsel Not Ineffective for Failing to File Motion to Dismiss - Defendant's conviction of robbery with a dangerous weapon, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Va17s14-87" target="_blank">G.S. 14-87</a></cite>,
                            was affirmed because defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel based on a failure to move to dismiss the charge; the evidence was sufficient to support the charge, because the evidence established that defendant
                            used a box cutter, which was classified as a dangerous weapon, and that the victim believed that his life was being threatened. State v. Pratt, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 161, 587 S.E.2d 437 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Through the testimony of a middle school teacher that defendant, a juvenile, dragged her and struggled while the teacher was trying to prevent defendant from assaulting another student, the State had presented enough evidence for a charge of assault on
                            a state employee in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-33ol1c4" target="_blank">G.S. 14-33(c)(4)</a></cite> to withstand a motion to dismiss. Thus,
                            defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to renew the motion at the close of all of the evidence. In re A.V., <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 317, 654 S.E.2d 811 (2008).

                            Liberal Construction. - The Constitution ought to be liberally construed to preserve personal rights and protect the citizen against self-incriminating evidence. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 386</cite>, 21
                            S.E. 196 (1895); State v. Medley, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 710</cite>, 100 S.E. 591 (1919).

                            Right to Remain Silent at All Times. - The right to remain silent does not arise when an arrestee is given his Miranda warnings. It is a right which he possesses at all times under U.S. Const., Amend. V and under this section. State v. Lane,
                            <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 265 S.E.2d 493, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 382</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 273 (1980).

                            The constitutional inhibition against self-incrimination is directed against compulsion, and not against voluntary admissions, confessions, or testimony freely given on the trial. Such statements, confessions, and testimony voluntarily given on a former
                            trial are received against the accused as his admissions. State v. Farrell, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 804</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 560 (1944); State v. Sheffield, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 309</cite>,

                            The privilege against self-incrimination is one against being compelled to testify. It furnishes no protection against the use of testimony which was voluntarily given. State v. Floyd, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 434</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Privilege Protects Against Only Real Dangers. - The privilege against self-incrimination protects against real dangers, not remote and speculative possibilities, and a witness may not arbitrarily refuse to testify without existence in fact of a real danger,
                            it being for the court to determine whether that real danger exists. Johnson County Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Grainger, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 256 S.E.2d 500, cert. denied,

                        <p>
                            Court Determines Applicability of Privilege. - The witness is not exonerated from answering merely because he declares that in so doing he would incriminate himself. His say-so does not of itself establish the hazard of incrimination. It is for the court
                            to say whether his silence is justified and to require him to answer if it clearly appears to the court that he is mistaken. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d
                            906 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Applicability Depends upon the Case. - If a witness, upon interposing his claim of immunity, were required to prove the hazard in the sense in which a claim is usually required to be established in court, he would be compelled to surrender the very protection
                            which the privilege is designed to guarantee. To sustain the privilege, it need only be evidenced from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation
                            of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result. The trial judge in appraising the claim must be governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the
                            facts actually in evidence. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971).

                            Questions Subjecting Defendant to Punitive Damages. - This provision protects defendants from being required to answer questions, on an order of examination, which will necessarily tend to subject them to a verdict or an award of punitive damages, and
                            to an execution against the person, the effect of which would be to deprive them entirely of their homestead exemption and of any personal property exemption over fifty dollars. Allred v. Graves,
                            <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 31</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 186 (1964).

                            Guaranty Extends to Any Proceedings Sanctioned by Law. - The constitutional guaranties against self-incrimination are to be liberally construed and they apply not only to criminal prosecutions but to any proceedings sanctioned by law, including examinations
                            before trial. Allred v. Graves, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 31</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 186 (1964).

                            The privilege against self-incrimination may be exercised by a witness in any proceeding. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971).

                            The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it. Johnson County Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Grainger,

                            Civil Actions Involving Arrest, Imprisonment or Execution Against the Person. - The constitutional protection against self-incrimination extends to civil actions that subject one to arrest, imprisonment or execution against the person. Shaw v. Williamson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 604, 331 S.E.2d 203, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 669</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 496 (1985).

                            Privilege Extends to Pleading Stage of Civil Action for Punitive Damages. - A defendant may plead his privilege against self-incrimination in a civil action where the plaintiff asks for punitive damages, and the privilege applies to protect a party from
                            self-incrimination at the pleadings stage of an action. Therefore, in an action to recover compensatory and punitive damages for alienation of affections and criminal conversation, where defendant refused to answer the allegations
                            of plaintiff's complaint claiming his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, the trial court erred in deeming the allegations as admitted pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,

                            Refusal to Answer Interrogatories in Civil Action for Punitive Damages. - Fact that a plaintiff seeks punitive damages does not, ipso facto, entitle defendant to refuse, with impunity, to submit to requested discovery, where the responses, whether individually
                            or collectively, would not necessarily tend to subject defendant to a punitive damages award. Stone v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 289 S.E.2d 898, cert. denied and appeal
                            dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 392</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 220 (1982).

                        <p>
                            In a wrongful death action, defendant faced no peril of being subject to execution against the person for not satisfying a judgment for punitive damages, as there was no allegation in the complaint that would support the required statutory findings for
                            execution against the person. Therefore, there was no basis for defendant declining to answer interrogatories on the grounds of self-incrimination. Shaw v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite>                            604, 331 S.E.2d 203, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 669</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 496 (1985).

                        <p>
                            In a wrongful death action, defendant could not have incriminated himself criminally by answering certain interrogatories, because, based on the same incident referred to in the complaint, he was charged with death by vehicle and driving while intoxicated,
                            pled guilty, and complied with the judgments entered on the convictions. Shaw v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 604, 331 S.E.2d 203, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 669</cite>,

                            Scope of Protection. - The fair interpretation of the clause that the defendant "shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself" seems to be to secure one who is or may be accused of crime from making any compulsory revelations which may be given
                            in evidence against him on his trial for the offense. LaFontaine v. Southern Underwriters Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 132</cite> (1880).

                            Admissions Tending to Incriminate. - The protection against self-incrimination is not limited to admissions that would subject a witness to criminal prosecution; the privilege also extends to admissions that may only tend to incriminate. State v. Smith,
                            <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971).

                            Links in Chain of Evidence. - The privilege afforded against self-incrimination extends not only to answers that would in themselves support a conviction under a criminal statute, but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of
                            evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a crime. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971). See also, Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 386</cite>,

                            The protection afforded by the privilege against self-incrimination does not merely encompass evidence which may lead to criminal conviction, but includes information which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence that could lead to prosecution,
                            as well as evidence which an individual reasonably believes could be used against him in a criminal prosecution. Johnson County Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

                            Silence in Face of Accusation of Guilt. - Defendant's silence in face of an accusation of guilt cannot be competent as an implied admission when the accusation is made during interrogation of defendant by officers of the law. To compel defendant to reply
                            to an accusation under such circumstances on pain of having his silence considered against him would amount to an infringement of his constitutional right not to be compelled to incriminate himself. State v. Fuller,
                            <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 710</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 286 (1967).

                            Defendant's silence in the rightful exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination may not be considered an admission of the truth of incriminating statements made in defendant's presence by a prospective State's witness in response to an officer's
                            questions. State v. Castor, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 286</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 848 (1974).

                            If police officers properly warn an accused of his constitutional rights, his silence may not be used against him. State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 472</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 132 (1975).

                        <p>
                            Where an arrestee is the focus of suspicion, has been held in custody for a significant period of time without being advised of his Miranda rights, is aware of his right to remain silent, and makes it clear that he is relying on his right to remain silent,
                            his in-custody silence in the face of accusation and possible prosecution cannot be the subject of cross-examination. State v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 265 S.E.2d 493,
                            aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 382</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 273 (1980).

                            Where police officers told defendant that anything he said, or did not say, in response to statements made by an eyewitness could be used for or against him, their warning violated the provision of this section, which requires that no person charged with
                            crime shall be compelled to give self-incriminating evidence. State v. Fuller, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 710</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 286 (1967).

                            Necessity of Advising Defendant of Rights Where Significantly Deprived of Freedom. - When an officer told defendant that he would get a warrant for him and would leave an officer at defendant's home until the warrant could be procured, defendant was deprived
                            of his freedom in a significant way; it was therefore necessary to advise him of his rights before his answer to the question as to how long he had been at his home could be introduced into evidence. State v. Hoyle,
                            <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 232</cite>, 382 S.E.2d 752 (1989).

                            Defendant's failure to testify may not be considered an admission of the truth of testimony which tends to incriminate him. State v. Castor, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 286</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 848 (1974); State v. McCall,

                        <p>
                            Defendant was entitled to a new trial because the trial court erroneously overruled his objection to the prosecution's closing comments about defendant's decision not to testify in trial for felonious breaking or entering. The error was prejudicial and
                            required a new trial. State v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 551</cite>, 434 S.E.2d 193 (1993).

                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 23 rights were violated where the prosecutor's statements referred repeatedly to defendant's silence, not merely to his behavior, and clearly urged the jury to infer that defendant was sane enough to know that remaining
                            silent was in his best interest; the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as the only real issue was whether defendant was legally insane at the time of the murder, three mental health experts testified that they
                            believed defendant was legally insane, and lay witnesses and circumstances presented the only evidence of defendant's sanity. State v. Durham, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 623 S.E.2d 63 (2005).

                            But May be Harmless. - The prosecutor's improper, slightly veiled, indirect comment on defendant's failure to testify was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 309</cite>, 543

                        <p>
                            Assuming that the prosecutor commented on defendant's failure to testify, the error was harmless given that defendant stipulated to his prior conviction and the evidence showing that he possessed the firearms found in his vehicle. State v. Martinez,
                            <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 284, 795 S.E.2d 386 (2016).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in allowing police officer's comments on murder defendant's decision to exercise her constitutional right to remain silent upon her arrest; the comments were elicited by the defense counsel and defense counsel repeatedly asked
                            officer to explain his answers and did not object to, or move to strike the comments. State v. Jennings, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 579</cite>, 430 S.E.2d 188 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1028,

                            Prosecutor Impermissibly Commented on Defendant's Silence. - State's cross-examination of defendant, examination of the officer, and closing argument attacked defendant's exercise of his right against self-incrimination in such a manner as to leave a
                            strong inference with the jury that part of defendant's testimony was an after-the-fact creation; the prosecutor impermissibly commented on defendant's silence in violation of his rights under the North Carolina and federal
                            constitutions. State v. Shores, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 342, 573 S.E.2d 237 (2002).

                            Misstatement of Silence Jury Instruction. - The defendant's rights under this section were not violated by the trial court's misstatement that the defendant's failure to testify "creates into presumption against him" where the court went on to state,
                            "therefore, his silence in this case is not to influence your decision in any way." State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 122</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 334 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 840, 122

                        <p>
                            Right to Remain Silent Not Violated. - Where the State did not ask detective whether defendant exercised his right to remain silent, he only testified that defendant was read his rights and indicated he understood those rights and no specific inquiry
                            or argument was made about defendant's silence, defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent therefore was not used against him and his constitutional rights were not violated. State v. Carter,
                            <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 422</cite>, 440 S.E.2d 268 (1994).

                        <p>
                            Where the prosecutor was directly responding to argument made by defendant relating to a specific piece of evidence and the argument did not relate to whether defendant himself sought to testify, it simply constituted a misstatement regarding the parties'
                            relative rights to introduce the statement, not a comment on defendant's failure to testify. State v. Ratliff, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 610</cite>, 461 S.E.2d 325 (1995).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant's right to remain silent under this section was not violated by the State's reference to his failure to assert his self-defense when he made spontaneous inculpatory statements prior to his arrest, nor by its reference to his post-arrest silence.
                            State v. Washington, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 540 S.E.2d 388 (2000), cert denied, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 396</cite>, 547 S.E.2d 427 (2001).

                            Trial court's curative instruction to the jury following the prosecutor's comment at trial was sufficient, even though not made immediately after the prosecutor's comments, as the the trial court stated that the comment was improper, and the statement
                            was followed by an instruction to the jury not to consider the failure of the accused to offer the accused as a witness. State v. Kemmerlin, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 446</cite>, 573 S.E.2d
                            870 (2002).

                            Testimony that defendant declined to answer questions after he was arrested was harmless error because (1) the prosecutor did not solicit the testimony, which was offered in response to a question asking for a chronology of events surrounding defendant's
                            arrest, (2) no further reference was made during the trial to defendant asserting his post-arrest right to remain silent, and (3) there was strong circumstantial evidence establishing defendant's guilt. State v. Bailey,
                            <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 577 S.E.2d 683 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err by allowing a detective to testify that defendant refused to make a statement to police because defendant did not object to that testimony during trial; in addition, the trial court did not have an obligation to give the jury a
                            curative instruction, sua sponte, after a witness who testified stated during cross-examination that if defendant didn't agree with what the witness said, defendant should defend himself. State v. Batchelor,
                            <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 579 S.E.2d 422 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not violate defendant's right to remain silent where the police detective testified that defendant was quiet during questioning and often refused to respond to questions, and where the prosecutor referred to this testimony during closing
                            arguments; the detective was asked about defendant's demeanor during questioning, not defendant's exercise of the right to remain silent, as defendant had waived defendant's Miranda rights and had agreed to speak with the detective.
                            State v. Lyles, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 615 S.E.2d 890, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 73</cite>, 622 S.E.2d 625 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Where a prosecutor, during cross-examination in a second-degree murder trial, questioned defendant on the reason for omitting from a voluntary discussion with a deputy such important facts as that the victim had been drunk, was possibly on cocaine, and
                            had threatened defendant's life several times prior to the shooting, defendant's right to remain silent was not violated, because the cross-examination questions did not constitute an impermissible comment upon the invocation
                            of the right, and any error was harmless. State v. Ezzell, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 417, 642 S.E.2d 274, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 432</cite>,

                            Although defendant contended that the trial court erred by overruling his objections to the prosecutors' closing arguments, the appellate court found that: (1) defendant's argument that the prosecutor's statements regarding defendant's failure to present
                            mental health evidence or a mental health defense violated his constitutional right not to testify under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 23 was without merit because the State's argument highlighted the total lack of evidence at trial supporting the forecast of evidence by defense counsel in the opening statement and was not a comment on the failure
                            of the accused to testify; and (2) defendant's argument that the prosecutor's arguments regarding the failure to present an accident defense violated defendant's right not to testify because defendant was the only person who
                            could testify that the child's injuries were accidental was without merit because the prosecutor's comments were not directed toward defendant's failure to testify, but rather were directed to the lack of any mention of mental
                            health or accident in the trial court's jury instructions, and the prosecutor's argument was a request to the jury to follow the trial court's instructions, and not to create legal issues during their deliberations that were
                            not part of the trial court's instructions. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 684 S.E.2d 450 (2009).

                        <p>
                            In a case in which defendant was convicted by a jury on two counts first-degree murder on the bases of felony murder and of malice, premeditation and deliberation and, after a capital sentencing proceeding, he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of
                            life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, defendant argued unsuccessfully on appeal that the trial erred by failing to intervene ex mero motu to exclude comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments. The
                            prosecution responded to defendant's attacks on two individuals and made permissible comments on defendant's failure to produce witnesses or exculpatory evidence to contradict or refute evidence presented by the State; the
                            prosecution's remarks did not constitute a direct reference to his failure to testify and did not require a curative instruction. State v. Graham, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 204,

                            Prosecutor's questions to officers about defendant's lack of an explanation did not use defendant's exercise of the right to remain silent against defendant because nothing showed defendant was given Miranda warnings or at any time specifically invoked
                            the right to remain silent. State v. Triplett, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 810 S.E.2d 404 (2018).

                            Comment on Prior Silence After Defendant Takes Stand. - With or without a
                            <i>
    Miranda
   </i> warning, a defendant's right to remain silent is guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. V, as well as by this section. Any comment upon the exercise of this right, nothing else appearing, is impermissible. However, when
                            a defendant chooses to testify in his own behalf, his U.S. Const., Amend. V right to remain silent must give way to the State's right to seek to determine, by way of impeachment, whether his prior silence is inconsistent with
                            his trial testimony. The test is whether, under the circumstances at the time of arrest, it would have been natural for defendant to have asserted the same defense asserted at trial. State v. McGinnis, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite>                            421, 320 S.E.2d 297 (1984).

                            Argument on Failure to Tell Police of Defense. - District attorney's question and argument to the jury as to defendant's failure to tell the police of his defense were prejudicial errors; since there was no eyewitness to the shooting other than defendant,
                            and since his defense depended on the jury's acceptance of his version of the event, the State failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that it was harmless to attack the credibility of his version by improper evidence,
                            which improper evidence was reinforced by jury argument. State v. Hoyle, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 232</cite>, 382 S.E.2d 752 (1989).

                            Truth or Falsity of Statements. - The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination bars the introduction of all statements falling within its scope, without regard for their truth or falsity. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 390</cite>,

                            Forced Production of Incriminating Documents. - The protection afforded to defendants in criminal action by this section is a matter of absolute right to them, and extends to the forced production of letters and other papers in their possession that may
                            tend to incriminate them upon the trial. State v. Hollingsworth, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 595</cite>, 132 S.E. 667 (1926).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The introduction in evidence of incriminating papers taken from the defendant at the time of the arrest does not infringe the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination, under this section, and when he takes the stand in his own behalf he waives
                            his constitutional right against self-incrimination. State v. Shoup, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 69</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 697 (1946), distinguishing State v. Hollingsworth, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 595</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Although the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination applies to the production of papers, so that if the accused is compelled to produce them the privilege is violated, lawful seizure of such evidence (as, for example, pursuant to a valid
                            search warrant) obviously differs from requiring the accused to produce it and does not violate the privilege. State v. Downing, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 743, 230 S.E.2d 581 (1976).

                            Inapplicability of Privilege to Physical Evidence. - Upon trial of defendant for violating the prohibition law, the introduction into evidence of testimony of the officer making the arrest that he found a half-gallon jar of liquor on the person of the
                            defendant was competent, and was not in violation of the constitutional provision that a defendant may not be compelled to give evidence against himself, the provision not applying to physical facts or conditions. State v.
                            Hickey, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. 45</cite>, 150 S.E. 615 (1929).

                        <p>
                            The admission of incriminating testimony of defendant's physical condition by witnesses who examined her without objection did not violate defendant's constitutional right not to be compelled to give evidence against herself, as provided in this section.
                            State v. Eccles, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 825</cite>, 172 S.E. 415 (1934).

                        <p>
                            The constitutional guarantee that a defendant shall not be compelled to testify against himself, as provided by this section, does not preclude testimony by a witness as to marks on defendant's body tending to identify him as the perpetrator of the crime.

                            The scope of the privilege against self-incrimination includes only the process of testifying by word of mouth or in writing. It has no application to such physical, evidential circumstances as may exist on the accused's body or about his person. State
                            v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 390</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 572 (1951), overruled on other grounds, State v. Silver, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 709</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 247 (1975); State v.

                        <p>
                            The scope of the privilege against self-incrimination, in history and in principle, includes only the process of testifying by word of mouth or in writing, i.e., the process of disclosure by utterance. It has no application to such physical evidential
                            circumstances as may exist on the accused's body or about his person. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 253</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 129 (1970).

                            Identifying Physical Characteristics. - Handwriting samples, blood samples, fingerprints, clothing, hair, voice demonstrations, even the body itself, are identifying physical characteristics and are outside the protection of the privilege against self-incrimination.

                            Distinguishing Marks. - Where witnesses for the State had testified as to a small scar near the culprit's left eye, a small mole on his left ear, and gold fillings in his teeth, upon return of the jury into the courtroom in disagreement as to defendant's
                            identity as the culprit, the court did not commit prejudicial error in permitting a juror, with defendant's consent, to examine defendant's body for the distinguishing marks. State v. Floyd,
                            <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 434</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 478 (1957).

                            Blood and Urine Tests. - Where defendant pleaded insanity at the time of the homicide due to the continued use of liquor and opiates, and the record failed to show any compulsion on the part of the officers in obtaining specimens of defendant's blood
                            and urine in order to ascertain the presence or absence of alcohol or morphine in his system, it was held that defendant's contention that the obtaining of the specimens compelled him to give evidence against himself, in violation
                            of this section, was untenable. State v. Cash, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 818</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 277 (1941).

                            Expert testimony as to the results of a test of defendant's blood is admissible on the trial of a charge of driving a motor vehicle upon the public highways within the State while under the influence of intoxicating beverages. State v. Willard,

                            Motion Pictures. - Motion pictures of an accused in a criminal action are not per se testimonial in nature, and, where they are properly used to illustrate competent and relevant testimony of a witness, their use does not violate accused's privilege against
                            self-incrimination. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 253</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 129 (1970).

                        <p>
                            When a sound motion picture contains incriminating statements by the defendant made from his knowledge of the offense upon defendant's objection, the judge must conduct a voir dire to determine the admissibility of the in-custody statements or admissions
                            contained in the sound picture. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 253</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 129 (1970).

                            Demonstration of Act of Killing. - Upon trial for murder in the first degree, where there is other circumstantial evidence of the prisoner's guilt, it is not duress to require the prisoner to place himself in such position as to show that he could have
                            fired the fatal shot from a window and killed the deceased, as this is not considered as making a person furnish evidence against himself, it being dependent upon physical facts and conditions and not upon confessions or statements
                            of the prisoner. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 238</cite>, 76 S.E. 249 (1912).

                            Positioning of Defendant for Purpose of Identification. - Testimony that defendant was placed for identification in the relative position to a witness as the perpetrator was seen by her just before committing a criminal offense is not objectionable as
                            forcing defendant to give evidence against himself in denial of his constitutional rights. State v. Neville, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 731</cite>, 95 S.E. 55 (1918).

                            Who is Protected. - Immunity from self-incrimination extends not only to one who actually testifies as a witness, but also to the defendant in the trial, even if he declines to testify as a witness in his own behalf. State v. Hollingsworth,
                            <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 595</cite>, 132 S.E. 667 (1926).

                        <p>
                            The privilege against self-incrimination can be claimed only by the witness, and when it is claimed, it is guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. V, as well as by this section. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite>                            46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971).

                        <p>
                            A defendant who chooses to testify waives his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination with respect to the testimony he gives, and that waiver is no less effective or complete because the defendant may have been motivated to take the witness stand
                            in the first place only by reason of the strength of the lawful evidence adduced against him. State v. Wills, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 546</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 328 (1977).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The defendant waives his constitutional privilege not to answer questions tending to incriminate himself when he voluntarily testifies in his own behalf. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 805</cite>, 11 S.E. 1016
                            (1890).

                        <p>
                            Whenever the defendant in a criminal action voluntarily testifies in his own defense he assumes the position of a witness and subjects himself to all the disadvantages of that position. In doing so, he acknowledges the right of the prosecution to test
                            his credibility and he waives his constitutional privilege not to answer questions which tend to incriminate him or to prove the specific offense with which he is charged. State v. O'Neal,
                            <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 22</cite>, 120 S.E. 817 (1924).

                        <p>
                            Defendant was tricked or cajoled into waiving his right to counsel and his privilege against self-incrimination, and his statements to a State Bureau of Investigation agent therefore were not voluntary, where the evidence tended to show that defendant
                            and his attorney went to SBI headquarters in Raleigh for defendant to be given a polygraph examination; defendant and his attorney were told that the examination would consist of the polygraph test itself and an interrogation;
                            they were also told that the attorney could not be present during the test phase but that he would be allowed to be present during the interrogation phase; contrary to this advice, defendant's attorney was left outside the
                            examination room during the test and the interrogation; the attorney, who could neither see nor hear what was transpiring, thought the testing phase was still in progress, and defendant himself apparently assumed that his lawyer
                            would be admitted to the room at the proper time. State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 588 (1980).

                            Defendant Testifying May Be Cross-Examined on In-Custody Statements. - A trial court may properly allow the prosecuting attorney to cross-examine defendant with reference to in-custody statements for the purpose of impeaching defendant's trial testimony,
                            notwithstanding the fact that defendant was not represented by counsel and had not waived the right to counsel when the statements were made. State v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite>                            340, 188 S.E.2d 600, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 626</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 472 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Defendant's privilege against self-incrimination was not violated where State was permitted to show for purposes of impeachment that defendant had not voluntarily turned himself in to the police after defendant had already testified to the contrary. State
                            v. Lester, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 239</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 268 (1976).

                            The prosecutor's impeachment of defendant by cross-examining him about his failure to tell officers, while making an in-custody statement, that he was acting to protect himself from attack when he shot deceased did not violate defendant's constitutional
                            rights. State v. Haith, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 269 S.E.2d 205, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 403</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 449 (1980).

                        <p>
                            In a capital murder case where defendant claimed to have been present when another person killed the victim, it was not improper for the State to cross-examine defendant as to defendant's failure, in post-arrest statements, to reveal the identity of the
                            other person. State v. Fair, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 131</cite>, 552 S.E.2d 568 (2001).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in allowing the cross-examination of defendant in regards to his prior inconsistent statements because defendant failed to mention his story of a consensual sexual encounter on the night of the alleged offense to the detective
                            which he later recalled with a high level of particularity during direct examination; such a memorable encounter would have been natural for defendant to recall at the time the detective was conducting his investigation; and
                            the prosecutor did not exploit defendant's right to remain silent, but instead merely inquired as to why defendant did not remain consistent between testifying on direct examination and in his interview with the detective two
                            years prior. State v. Wyrick, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 534, 809 S.E.2d 608, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 113</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 238, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 368 (2018).

                            Questions About Prior Convictions on Cross-Examination. - Defendant's testimony on cross-examination about an additional conviction for assault with a firearm which he had failed to mention during his direct examination was relevant impeachment evidence;
                            thus, it was not only proper but also prudent for the prosecutor to attempt to elicit further details about defendant's prior convictions. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite>                            547, 272 S.E.2d 384 (1980).

                            Failure to Disclose Alibi Defense Prior to Trial Not an Inconsistent Prior Statement for Cross-Examination Purposes. - In a prosecution of defendant for possession and sale of heroin, where defendant was arrested and taken to a police station, indictments
                            were read to him, and defendant interrupted the reading to state that he had not sold heroin to the person named in the indictments, defendant's failure to disclose his alibi defense to the police officers then, or to some
                            other person prior to trial, did not amount to an inconsistent statement in light of his in-court testimony relative to an alibi, and the district attorney's cross-examination of defendant concerning failure to disclose his
                            alibi was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial. State v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 382</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 273 (1980).

                            Accomplice Could Not Refuse to Answer on Cross-Examination After Incriminating Defendant. - An accomplice could not testify on direct examination to facts tending to incriminate defendant and at the same time refuse to answer questions on cross-examination
                            relating to matters embraced in his examination-in-chief, and where he refused to answer relevant questions on cross-examination on the ground that his answers might tend to incriminate him, it was error for the court to refuse
                            defendant's motion that his testimony-in-chief be stricken from the record, the refusal to answer the questions on cross-examination rendering the testimony-in-chief incompetent. State v. Perry,
                            <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 796</cite>, 188 S.E. 639 (1936).

                            Defendant who, prior to his own indictment, gave testimony at codefendant's continuance hearing, placing himself in the company of the prosecuting witness on the evening in question, was not denied his privilege against self-incrimination, even though
                            he was not represented by counsel or informed of his right against compulsory self-incrimination, despite the fact that codefendant's attorney, who had sought his testimony, was acting with the full complicity of the State,
                            as defendant was not compelled to speak to his detriment. State v. Flowers, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 208</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 773 (1986).

                            Pre-arrest warrantless recording of defendant's incriminating statements through witness did not violate defendant's right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 20, inasmuch as defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy regarding a conversation he voluntarily maintained with a confederate; the recording did not violate defendant's right under this section to be free
                            from compulsory self-incrimination because his participation in the conversation was wholly voluntary, albeit ill-advised, and did not violate defendant's right under this section to counsel because the conversation in question
                            occurred during the initial investigation of defendant prior to his arrest. State v. Levan, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 155</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 429 (1990).

                        <p>
                            Right Not Violated. - Defendant's alleged "Hobson's choice" between asserting her privilege against self-incrimination and her right to testify on her own behalf was illusory where trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a continuance in noncapital
                            indictment for murder of stepson did not force defendant to choose between two constitutional rights but to make a purely tactical decision as to whether it would be more advantageous to testify in this trial, in her capital
                            trial, in both trials, or not at all; defendant would have faced the same dilemma regardless of which case was tried first since any incriminating statements made at the first trial could later be used against her at the second
                            trial. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 264</cite>, 457 S.E.2d 841 (1995).

                        <p>
                            Defendant's motion to suppress incriminating statements made by him to a police officer while evidence was being presented during voir dire was properly denied since the statements made by defendant were spontaneous and did not warrant a conclusion that
                            the officer should have known that he was about to elicit an incriminating statement from defendant by responding "so do I" when defendant commented he knew where a baseball cap had come from that was being presented as evidence;
                            defendant's constitutional rights were not violated, because the officer's conduct did not constitute interrogation and no Miranda warning was required. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite>                            763, 600 S.E.2d 16 (2004).

                            While the court did not believe the prosecutor's questions were intended to focus the jury's attention on defendant's lack of cooperation with law enforcement following his arrest, even elevating the inquiry to a condemnation of defendant's silence could
                            not amount to plain error when defendant made the same inquiry on cross examination. State v. King, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 347, 721 S.E.2d 336 (2012).

                            Affidavit on Motion to Suppress. - Section 15A-977(a) requires an affidavit for a motion to suppress, but requiring the affidavit does not amount to compelling defendant to be a witness against himself in a criminal case in violation of U.S. Const., Amend.

                            Miranda Not Applicable to Abuse and Neglect Proceedings. - In case involving termination of parental rights, admission of mother's confession to injuring her child was not a violation of her Miranda rights; Miranda does not apply to civil juvenile abuse
                            and neglect proceedings. In re Pittman, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 756, 561 S.E.2d 560 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 982, 123 S. Ct. 1799, 155 L. Ed. 2d 673 (2003).

                            such an admission to win release violated the juvenile's self-incrimination privilege under the state and federal constitutions. In re Lineberry, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 572

                            When Confession Is Admissible. - An extrajudicial confession by an accused is admissible against him when it is voluntarily given and is not induced by threats or fear, and when the defendant has knowingly and intelligently waived his right to have counsel
                            present at the time the confession is given. State v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 264 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First degree felony murder and conspiracy to commit robbery with dangerous weapon convictions were affirmed since the trial court's decision to admit a videotape of the defendant's post-Miranda interrogation was properly based on substantial evidence
                            that he (1) signed a waiver of, and (2) never made a clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal assertion of his right to counsel, and did not assert his right to remain silent. State v. Ash, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite>                            715, 611 S.E.2d 855, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 66</cite>, 621 S.E.2d 878 (2005).

                            Inadmissibility of Involuntary Confessions or Incriminating Statements. - Although Miranda warnings are required only when defendant is being subjected to custodial interrogation and are not required during the investigatory stage when defendant is not
                            in custody at the time he makes the statement, all involuntary confessions or incriminating statements, made in custody or out, are ordinarily inadmissible for any purpose. State v. Stephens,
                            <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 588 (1980).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Exclusion of Second Confession After Improper First Confession. - Neither section 19 nor this section of N.C. Const., Art. I required the suppression of a defendant's second confession, made after proper warnings and the defendant's voluntary waiver of
                            his constitutional rights, when that confession followed an earlier confession which had to be excluded under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). State v. Hicks,
                            <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 467</cite>, 428 S.E.2d 167 (1993), overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 332</cite>, 543 S.E.2d 823 (2001).

                        <p>
                            Plea of Guilty. - If a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is sustained, it must appear affirmatively that it was entered voluntarily and understandingly. State v. Ford, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 62</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 741
                            (1972).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination are necessary whenever law-enforcement officers question a person who has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his liberty in any significant way. State v.
                            Pruitt, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 442</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 92 (1975).

                        <p>
                            The ultimate test of the admissibility of a confession still remains whether the statement made by the accused was in fact voluntarily and understandingly made. State v. Pruitt, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 442</cite>, 212
                            S.E.2d 92 (1975); State v. Garnett, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 211 S.E.2d 519, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 262</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 622 (1975); State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>,
                            266 S.E.2d 588 (1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every statement made by a person in custody as a result of an illegal arrest is not ipso facto involuntary and inadmissible, but the facts and circumstances surrounding such arrest and the in-custody statement should be considered in determining whether
                            the statement is voluntary and admissible. Voluntariness remains as the test of admissibility. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 141</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 53 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Admissibility depends upon whether the statement was freely and voluntarily made and whether the officers who elicited the statement employed appropriate procedural safeguards. State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>,
                            266 S.E.2d 588 (1980).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Question of voluntariness must be determined by the total circumstances of each particular case. State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 588 (1980); State v. Leak, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                            351, 368 S.E.2d 430 (1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the totality of circumstances indicates that defendant was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver of his rights, his statements are rendered involuntary as a matter of law. State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>,
                            266 S.E.2d 588 (1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In determining whether a defendant's statement was in fact voluntarily and understandingly made, the court must consider the totality of the circumstances of the case and may not rely upon any one circumstance standing alone and in isolation. State v.
                            Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 320 S.E.2d 900 (1985), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 594</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 823 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where defendant asserted that he had not slept nor eaten during the two days prior to his arrest, but failed to show by convincing evidence that he was impaired, intoxicated or coerced at the time he made statements to the police, the trial court did
                            not commit reversible error by admitting defendant's statements into evidence. State v. Cheek, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 48</cite>, 520 S.E.2d 545 (1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1245, 120 S.
                            Ct. 2694, 147 L. Ed. 2d 965 (2000).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant's motion to suppress post-arrest inculpatory statements was properly denied in his trial for first-degree murder and for robbery with a dangerous weapon where the totality of the circumstances indicated that defendant had voluntarily made the
                            statements, that his waiver of his Miranda rights was voluntary, intelligent, and knowingly made, that he never asked for counsel, that the conditions of the interview were of a non-coercive nature, that he was not on any substance
                            or in need of food or bathroom breaks, and the fact that he had subnormal mental capacity did not, alone, render the statement incompetent; accordingly, there was no violation of his rights under this section and suppression
                            of his statements was not required. State v. Mahatha, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 578 S.E.2d 617, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 466</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 773 (2003).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mental Condition as a Factor. - Though defendant's mental condition is a factor to be considered, that factor standing alone will not render an otherwise voluntary confession inadmissible. State v. Leak, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                            351, 368 S.E.2d 430 (1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where defendant contended that the four and one-half hour delay in taking him before a judicial official after service of warrants was a coercive factor which rendered his confession involuntary, but he did not show any causal connection between the confession
                            and the delay, no constitutional provision required exclusion of his statement on this ground. State v. Leak, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 368 S.E.2d 430 (1988).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A confession obtained by the slightest emotions of hope or fear ought to be rejected. State v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 320 S.E.2d 900, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 594</cite>,
                            342 S.E.2d 823 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Effect of Miranda Warnings. - The fact that the technical procedural requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966) are demonstrated by the prosecution does not, standing alone, control the question
                            of whether a confession was voluntarily and understandingly made, but the answer to this question must be found from a consideration of the entire record. State v. Pruitt, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 442</cite>,
                            212 S.E.2d 92 (1975).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Custodial admonitions to an accused by police officers to tell the truth, standing alone, do not render a confession inadmissible. State v. Pruitt, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 442</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 92 (1975).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Intoxication When Confession Is Made. - Where a defendant pleads drunkenness as a bar to the admissibility of his confession, unless defendant's intoxication amounts to mania - that is, unless he is so drunk as to be unconscious of the meaning of his
                            words - his intoxication does not render inadmissible his confession of facts tending to incriminate him. The extent of his intoxication when the confession was made, however, is a relevant circumstance bearing upon its credibility,
                            and is a question exclusively for the jury's determination. State v. McClure, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 288</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 693 (1972); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 439</cite>,
                            222 S.E.2d 242, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 45, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant claimed his Miranda waiver and confessions were affected by alcohol and precription drugs; the voluntariness of his Miranda waiver and confessions were supported by an officer's testimony that the defendant was attentive and very coherent and
                            very understanding when he was read his Miranda rights. State v. Tuck, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 618 S.E.2d 265 (2005).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Intoxication Held Not to Preclude Conclusion of Voluntariness. - Where officers did not begin questioning defendant until some two hours after a blood alcohol test, and one officer explicitly testified that defendant appeared sober during the interview
                            and spoke rationally and coherently, and the trial court specifically found that defendant was not under the influence of alcohol during the interview, the fact that defendant may have experienced some lingering, mild intoxication
                            at the time of the confession did not preclude the conclusion that he confessed voluntarily. State v. McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 1</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 12 (1988), death sentence vacated
                            and remanded on other grounds, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Confession Held Voluntary. - The granting of defendant's request to see his girlfriend and the mother of his child did not render his confession involuntary where the investigators's statements that they would attempt to contact the women were made only
                            in response to defendant's request, where there was no evidence that investigators used the request as an inducement to obtain his confession, where investigators advised defendant that the police had no control over whether
                            the women came to the station, where defendant himself stated that his confession was not thereby induced, and where the request had no relation to relief from the charges he faced. State v. Wallace,
                            <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 481</cite>, 528 S.E.2d 326, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1018, 121 S. Ct. 581, 148 L. Ed. 2d 498 (2000).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress incriminating statements he made to law enforcement, and properly admitted those statements at trial, as none of the tactics that defendant cited that were used by the detectives who questioned
                            him rendered his confession involuntary or made his statements to police subsequently inadmissible. State v. Maniego, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 676, 594 S.E.2d 242 (2004).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant's post-Miranda statement was admissible because defendant was a 30-year-old high school graduate with experience in the criminal justice system based upon his numerous prior arrests, defendant was not threatened after being advised of his Miranda
                            rights orally and in writing, defendant waived his Miranda rights orally and in writing, defendant did not ask to speak to an attorney, and the officers advised defendant of the charge, the possible sentence he could receive,
                            the need for him to be truthful and help himself out by cooperating; and told defendant that if he cooperated his cooperation would be related to the district attorney's office and the judge. State v. Houston,
                            <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 367, 610 S.E.2d 777 (2005).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant's first degree murder conviction was affirmed because the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress his written confession as defendant's written waiver of his Miranda rights and his written confession were made understandingly,
                            knowingly, and voluntarily with the assistance of a police officer who acted as defendant's interpreter. State v. Nguyen, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 632 S.E.2d 197, appeal dismissed,
                            cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 653</cite>, 637 S.E.2d 189 (2006).

                            Hearing on Voluntariness. - When a purported confession of a defendant is offered into evidence and defendant objects, the trial judge, in the absence of the jury, hears evidence of both the State and the defendant upon the question of the voluntariness
                            of defendant's statements. The general rule is that after such inquiry, when there is conflicting evidence offered at the voir dire hearing, the trial judge shall make findings of fact to show the bases of his ruling on the
                            admissibility of the evidence offered. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 141</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 53 (1969).

                            In-custody statements attributed to a defendant, when offered by the State and objected to by the defendant, are inadmissible for any purpose unless, after a voir dire hearing in the absence of the jury, the court, based upon sufficient evidence, makes
                            factual findings that such statements were voluntarily and understandingly made by the defendant after he had been fully advised as to his constitutional rights. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 253</cite>,

                            When the State offers a confession in a criminal trial and defendant objects, the competency of the confession must be determined by the trial judge in a preliminary inquiry in the absence of the jury. State v. Garnett,

                            When a defendant challenges the admissibility of an in-custody confession, the trial judge must conduct a voir dire hearing to determine whether the confession was voluntarily made and whether the requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.
                            Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966) have been met. State v. Biggs, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 522</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 371 (1976).

                            Effect of Trial Court's Findings. - Trial judge's findings as to the voluntariness of a confession, and any other facts which determine whether it meets the requirements for admissibility, are conclusive if they are supported by competent evidence in

                            Review on Appeal. - Whether the conduct and language of investigating officers amounted to such threats or promises as to render a subsequent confession involuntary is a question of law reviewable on appeal. State v. Pruitt,

                            Admission of Confessions Upheld. - When a defendant has been given all the warnings required by the State and federal rules of evidence, and he understands them, and freely and voluntarily waives the right to have right to counsel and freely and voluntarily
                            makes a confession, then the admission of this confession in evidence at a jury trial does not violate defendant's right against self-incrimination. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 181</cite>,
                            203 S.E.2d 781, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 867, 95 S. Ct. 123, 42 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1974).

                        <p>
                            Where the trial court found that defendant was fully apprised of his rights to counsel and to remain silent, that he said he understood them, that he did not appear to be under the influence of drugs, and that he knew what he was doing, the trial court
                            ruled correctly that his subsequent confession was admissible. State v. Travatello, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 211 S.E.2d 467 (1975).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although defendant contended that his lack of sleep and food and his heavy use of drugs and alcohol shortly before his periods of interrogation rendered any in-custody statement involuntary, where after an extensive voir dire hearing the trial court found
                            that defendant was not interrogated on the evening of his arrest because he was drunk, defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquors or drugs and was furnished food and coffee when interrogated on the following
                            day, defendant was read his rights before questioning began, and defendant signed a waiver of his rights, the in-custody statement was freely, understandingly and voluntarily made and was therefore properly admitted into evidence.
                            State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 35</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 313 (1975), death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).

                            In a prosecution for armed robbery, the testimony of a witness employed as a dispatcher by the police department relating defendant's in-custody confession of guilt was admissible notwithstanding the dispatcher's failure to advise defendant of his constitutional
                            rights, where the dispatcher questioned defendant while visiting a relative who shared defendant's cell, was not in any way acting as a police officer, and was not, in fact, a police officer. State v. Johnson,

                            In a prosecution for driving under the influence, the trial court did not err in admitting defendant's confession made to a police officer where the court found that defendant was properly advised of his rights; he knowingly waived his rights; he pointed
                            to or told the officer of the wreck and described the location where he had the wreck; and his answers to the questions were free, voluntary, and not coerced by the officer; and the fact that defendant was intoxicated at the
                            time of his confession did not require its exclusion. State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 265 S.E.2d 451 (1980).

                            The trial court's findings of fact, not specifically excepted to by the defendant, fully supported its conclusions of law that defendant's statements to the police were freely, voluntarily and understandingly made and that none of the defendant's State
                            constitutional rights were violated by his arrest, detention, interrogation or statements. State v. Cheek, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 48</cite>, 520 S.E.2d 545 (1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S.

                            Assistance of a Pathologist. - Even though defendant's identity as the perpetrator of the crime charged was critical, and the state's case was built on circumstantial evidence, defendant failed to satisfy his burden of showing either that the assistance
                            of a pathologist would have materially aided him in the preparation of his defense or that the lack thereof deprived him of a fair trial. State v. Moseley, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 1</cite>,

                            him the opportunity to talk to counsel, and defendant indicated that he did not want to testify. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 823 S.E.2d 892 (2019).

                    No person shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of a jury in open court, except that a person accused of any criminal offense for which the State is not seeking a sentence of death in superior court may, in writing or on the record
                    in the court and with the consent of the trial judge, waive jury trial, subject to procedures prescribed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly may, however, provide for other means of trial for misdemeanors, with the right
                    of appeal for trial de novo.

                            Waiver of Jury Trial. - Trial court did not err in allowing defendant to waive his right to a jury trial because his waiver was knowing and voluntary where it was made through his counsel, on the record, and in writing, arraignment was not mandatory,
                            defendant never requested a formal arraignment, the hearing essentially served the purpose of an arraignment, the trial court was constitutionally authorized to accept defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial, defendant
                            made a strategic decision to ask for a bench trial, and he did not show on appeal how that decision prejudiced him. State v. Swink, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 218, 797 S.E.2d 330

                            Jury Trial May Not Be Waived After Plea of Not Guilty. - A defendant in a criminal prosecution for a felony or a misdemeanor may not waive his constitutional right to trial by jury in the superior court after entering a plea of "not guilty" without changing
                            his plea, nor may the General Assembly permit him to do so by statute; and where the court, after a plea of "not guilty," finds the defendant guilty without a jury trial, the judgment will be stricken out and the cause remanded.
                            State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 53</cite>, 182 S.E. 716 (1935). See also, State v. Muse, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 226</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 229 (1941).

                        <p>
                            A jury trial cannot be waived in a criminal action; hence, where the facts were agreed upon by the State and the accused and submitted to the judge for his decision, it was held that such a procedure was not warranted by the law. State v. Holt,

                            Where a defendant enters a plea of "not guilty" in the superior court, he may not thereafter, without being permitted to change his plea, waive his constitutional right of trial by jury. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. 656</cite>,

                            Upon defendant's appeal from judgment and sentence by the court after defendant had entered a conditional plea of guilty, the case would be remanded in order that a jury may pass upon defendant's guilt or innocence in accordance with defendant's constitutional

                            When a defendant pleads not guilty in cases where a trial by jury is guaranteed by the organic law, he must be tried by a jury of twelve, and he cannot waive jury trial. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 74</cite>,

         Closing Argument Referencing Not Guilty Plea Improper.
        </b> - Prosecutor's closing argument complaining about defendant's decision to plead not guilty violated his right to receive a fair trial and necessitated a new trial, given that defendants had an absolute right to
                            plead not guilty and be tried by a jury. State v. Goins, - N.C. App. - , 839 S.E.2d 858 (2020).

                            Conviction by Jury Necessary to Punishment. - It is fundamental that a defendant charged with crime, other than a petty misdemeanor, who pleads not guilty, may be punished only after conviction by a jury. State v. Ellis,

                            Where it can reasonably be inferred from the language of the trial judge that the sentence was imposed at least in part because defendant did not agree to a plea offer by the State and insisted on a trial by jury, defendant's constitutional right to trial
                            by jury has been abridged, and a new sentencing hearing must result. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 37</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 450 (1990).

                            A trial by a jury which is improperly constituted is so fundamentally flawed that the verdict cannot stand; thus, defendant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing where an alternate juror was substituted for a juror who was dismissed after participating

                            (3) and the juror demonstrated actual bias or bias implied as a matter of law that prejudiced the moving party. State v. Buckom, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 485 S.E.2d 319 (1997),

                            when the trial court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial based on the alleged misconduct of a juror; the juror inadvertent failure to disclose the 40-year-old information she had forgotten did not amount to concealment,
                            and the juror demonstrated no bias. State v. Maske, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 40</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 521 (2004).

                            Trial court's curative instruction to the jury following the prosecutor's comment at trial was sufficient, even though not made immediately after the prosecutor's comments, as the the trial court stated that the comment was improper, and the statement
                            was followed by an instruction to the jury not to consider the failure of the accused to offer the accused as a witness. State v. Kemmerlin, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 446</cite>, 573 S.E.2d

                            Trial judge did not coerce the jury by giving an Allen charge because while the jury's note "clearly stated" that one juror would not change his or her mind, the trial court had discretion to reinstruct the jury in situations where it perceived a deadlock;
                            the trial judge asked the jury, which had been deliberating for only 75 minutes, to continue to deliberate until 5:00 p.m. and instructed the jurors that they would resume deliberations the next morning if needed. State v.

                            the courtroom before hearing and addressing a jury request to review testimony, and to exercise its discretion in denying or granting the request. Failure of the trial court to comply with these mandates entitles defendant

                            Inquiry Into Alleged Communication Between Prosecution and Juror Was Not Required. - Trial court did not err by refusing to inquire further into an alleged communication between the prosecution and a juror where there was no indication that the alleged
                            inappropriate communication had any influence on the juror or the verdict of the entire jury; there was no evidence that the juror heard what the assistant district attorney discussed with the clerk in the courtroom, in the
                            presence of the court. State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 616 S.E.2d 306 (2005).

                            Inquiry by Trial Judge as to Jury's Numerical Split. - In the absence of a federal or state constitutional basis requiring the adoption of a per se rule, the court will look to the "totality of the circumstances" in evaluating a trial judge's inquiry
                            as to a jury's numerical split. State v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 500, 307 S.E.2d 794 (1983).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The context of inquiry as to the jury's numerical split may show that the inquiry is coercive, but such an inquiry is not inherently coercive or violative of this section's guarantee of the right to a trial by jury. State v. Yarborough,
                            <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 500, 307 S.E.2d 794 (1983).

                        <p>
                            An inquiry into a jury's numerical division is often useful in timing recesses, in determining whether there has been any progress toward verdict, and in deciding whether to declare a mistrial because of a dead-locked jury. State v. Yarborough,
                            <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 500, 307 S.E.2d 794 (1983); State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 304</cite>, 322 S.E.2d 389 (1984).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inquiries into the division of the jury are not a per se violation of this section when the trial court makes it clear that it does not desire to know whether the majority is for conviction or acquittal. Such inquiries are not inherently coercive, and
                            without more do not violate the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the North Carolina Constitution. The appropriate standard is whether in the totality of the circumstances the inquiry is coercive. State v. Fowler,
                            <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 304</cite>, 322 S.E.2d 389 (1984).

                        <p>
                            Trial judge's questions about the numerical division of a jury do not constitute a per se violation of this section. Rather, the proper analysis is whether, in considering the totality of the circumstances, the inquiry was coercive. State v. Bussey,
                            <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 92</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 564 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Trial judge did not violate defendant's right to trial by jury by asking the jury about its numerical division on the issue of guilt when the jury could not reach a verdict on charges of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine by transportation, trafficking
                            in cocaine by transportation, and maintaining a vehicle which was used for unlawfully keeping or selling controlled substances, or abuse its discretion by giving the jury an instruction on further deliberations, pursuant to
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1235" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1235</a></cite>. State v. Batchelor, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 579 S.E.2d 422 (2003).

                        <p>
                            The disjunctive phrasing of the jury instruction was not a fatal ambiguity which resulted in a nonunanimous jury verdict. State v. Oliver, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 202</cite>, 470 S.E.2d 16 (1996).

                        <p>
                            Polling of Jurors Was Proper. - Where each of the jurors individually was told the charges for which the jury had returned a guilty verdict and was asked whether this was their verdict and whether they still assented to the verdict there was no error
                            in the manner in which the jury was polled. State v. Ramseur, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 502</cite>, 450 S.E.2d 467 (1994).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's failure to inquire why jurors requested to be referred to by individual juror number the day after they returned guilty verdicts and were polled by name did not indicate that defendant was denied a fair trial; defendant's speculation that
                            the jurors were influenced by the seizure suffered by defendant's mother after the verdict was returned or by defendant's attack of a law enforcement officer after the jury was removed from the court room was not enough to
                            show exposure to external influence not was it a de facto indicator of prejudice. State v. Garcell, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 10</cite>, 678 S.E.2d 618 (2009).

                            Judge's Warning to Restrict Public Egress Was Proper. - Where trial judge informed those in the courtroom that he was concerned that the jury would be distracted by the movement of spectators in and out of the room and where he consequently warned them
                            that if they wished to leave the courtroom, they should do so immediately, for they would not be allowed to do so after closing arguments began, barring an emergency, the order was not a denial of a public trial in violation
                            of this section since judge did not vacate the courtroom nor bar the courtroom door without due warning to those within and without, and since the judge was authorized under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Xa59s15A-1034ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1034(a)</a></cite>                            to impose reasonable limitations on access to the courtroom.

                            Clearing Courtroom During Testimony of Child Rape Victim. - In a prosecution for first-degree rape of a child, the constitutional right of defendant to a public trial was not violated by the court's order that, during the testimony of the seven-year-old
                            victim, the courtroom be cleared of all persons except defendant, defendant's family, defense counsel, defense witnesses, the prosecutor, the State's witnesses, officers of the court, members of the jury, and members of the

                            Absent a statute providing for a jury trial, it is almost universally held that in juvenile court delinquency proceedings the alleged delinquent has no right under the pertinent State or federal Constitutions to demand that the issue of his delinquency
                            be determined by a jury. In re Burrus, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879 (1969), aff'd sub nom. McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1970).

                            Because the factors before the trial judge in determining sentencing are not elements of the offense, their consideration for purposes of sentencing is a function of the judge and is not susceptible to constitutional challenge based upon either the right

                            Determination of Appropriate Sentence. - North Carolina courts have long adhered to the principle forbidding a trial court from improperly considering the defendant's exercise of her rights under this provision of the Constitution as an influential factor

                            Defendant was granted a new trial of the kidnapping charge because defendant's right to a unanimous jury verdict was violated by virtue of the inclusion of the "removal" instruction; where the victim was moved a short distance of several feet, and was

                            There is no risk of a nonunanimous verdict where the statute under which the defendant is charged criminalizes a single wrong that may be proved by evidence of the commission of any one of a number of acts, and the court instructs the jury disjunctively
                            as to various alternative acts that will establish an element of the offense, because in such a case the particular act performed is immaterial. State v. Petty, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite>                            453, 512 S.E.2d 428 (1999).

                            the court must examine the verdict, the charge, the jury instructions, and the evidence to determine whether any ambiguity as to unanimity has been removed. State v. Petty, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite>                            453, 512 S.E.2d 428 (1999).

                            When defendant was charged with 10 counts of statutory rape, the trial court submitted all 10 counts to the jury without differentiating among them, the indictment alleged 10 counts occurring between two dates, without specifying a date for any one charge,
                            and the verdict sheets indicated guilty verdicts without specifying a particular offense, defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict was violated because it could not be said that the jury unanimously agreed
                            that defendant committed any particular offense. State v. Holden, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 586 S.E.2d 513 (2003), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 60</cite>, 602 S.E.2d

                            jury verdict was jeopardized. State v. Bates, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 27, 616 S.E.2d 280 (2005).

                            By instructing the jury that it could find defendant guilty of trafficking in marijuana if it found that defendant knowingly possessed or knowingly transported 10,000 pounds or more of marijuana, the trial judge submitted two possible crimes to the jury,
                            as the jury could find defendant guilty if it found that he committed either or both of the crimes submitted to it. Thus, the jury's verdict of guilty was fatally defective because it was ambiguous, depriving defendant of his
                            constitutional right to be convicted by a unanimous jury. State v. Diaz, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 545</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 488 (1986).

                            The trial court committed reversible error in instructing the jury that it could convict the defendant of first degree sex offense if it found that he forced the victim to perform either fellatio or anal intercourse, as defendant had a constitutional
                            right to be convicted by the unanimous verdict of a jury in open court, and under this instruction there was no way to tell whether the defendant was convicted of second degree sexual offense because the jury unanimously agreed
                            that the defendant engaged in fellatio, anal intercourse, both fellatio and anal intercourse, or whether some members of the jury found that he engaged in fellatio but not anal intercourse, and some found that he engaged in
                            anal intercourse but not fellatio. State v. Callahan, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 356 S.E.2d 403 (1987), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 378 S.E.2d 812 (1989).

                            Instructions in a disjunctive form on the charge of maliciously assaulting in a secret manner were fatally ambiguous, thereby resulting in an uncertain verdict in violation of defendant's right to a unanimous verdict. State v. Lyons,

                            A disjunctive jury instruction on a first-degree sexual offense did not risk a nonunanimous verdict by defining a sexual act as either cunnilingus or penetration, where the statutory definition of "sexual act" did not create disparate offenses, but merely
                            enumerated alternative methods of showing the commission of a sexual act. State v. Petty, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 512 S.E.2d 428 (1999).

                            While the evidence presented by the State tended to show that the marijuana weighed 18 pounds, defendant testified that the weight of the box was about six or seven pounds, thus, the evidence could support an inference that defendant possessed and/or
                            transported exactly 10 pounds of marijuana, which did not qualify as trafficking in marijuana under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a05s90-95ol1h1a" target="_blank">G.S. 90-95(h)(1)(a)</a></cite>.
                            Considering the evidence and erroneous jury instructions that the jury should find defendant guilty if it found that he possessed "10 pounds or more but less than 50 pounds" of marijuana, the appellate court could not conclude
                            that the jury unanimously convicted defendant under the conduct proscribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a05s90-95ol1h1a" target="_blank">G.S. 90-95(h)(1)(a)</a></cite>. State v. Trejo,

                            Where the jury was instructed on alternative theories of second-degree kidnapping, some of which lacked sufficient evidentiary support, and it was unclear which theory the jury based defendant's conviction on, defendant was entitled to a new trial on

                            a unanimous verdict, since this section proscribes a single offense, not crimes in the disjunctive, and even if all jurors did not agree as to the time and extent of the defendant's drunkenness, they unanimously found him guilty
                            of the single offense of impaired driving. State v. McCaslin, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 352, 511 S.E.2d 347 (1999).

                            Defendant's conviction for habitual impaired driving did not have to be overturned despite the fact that the verdict sheet given to the jury did not differentiate between the two statutory definitions of impaired driving, and thus it was not known which
                            definition applied; the fact remained that the jury unanimously found defendant guilty of the single offense of impaired driving, which meant that defendant was not deprived of his state constitutional and state statutory right
                            to a unanimous verdict. State v. Bradley, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 557, 640 S.E.2d 432 (2007).

                            Court of appeals erred in vacating defendant's conviction for first-degree kidnapping because the trial court's disjunctive jury instruction did not violate defendant's constitutional right to be convicted only by the unanimous verdict of a jury in open
                            court; it is not necessary for the State to prove, nor for the jury to find, that defendant committed a particular act other than that of confining, restraining, or removing the victim, and beyond that, defendant's intent or
                            purpose is the focus. State v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 749</cite>, 782 S.E.2d 505 (2016).

                            regarding the jurors' duty in the trial, and the jury was instructed on unanimity. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 823 S.E.2d 892 (2019).

                            in violation of defendant's right to a unanimous jury verdict; the State failed to show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the trial court instructed only the foreperson that the jurors needed to
                            resolve the issue in the jury room, and its failure to similarly instruct the remaining jurors could have given them the impression that it had resolved the matter, foreclosing further debate during deliberations. State v.

   </span> 24, the error is deemed preserved for appeal notwithstanding the defendant's failure to object because the right to a unanimous jury verdict is fundamental to the system of justice; while N.C. App. R. 10(b)(1) protects
                            judicial economy and speaks to the adversarial system of justice by requiring the parties to object in the majority of instances, it nevertheless recognizes that some questions may be deemed preserved for review by rule or
                            law. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 478</cite>, 681 S.E.2d 325 (2009).

                            Verdict Declared Unanimous Despite Initial Unresponsiveness. - Where the trial court, upon receiving an unresponsive answer to question concerning the unanimity of the verdict, repeated the question and received a responsive and affirmative answer, there
                            was no ambiguity in the announcement of the verdict and defendant was convicted in the fashion provided for by the Constitution. State v. Coats, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 615, 265

                            Right to Poll Jury. - The defendant was entitled as a matter of right to know whether each juror assented to the verdict, announced by the juror who undertook to answer for the jury, and to that end he had the right to insist that a specific question
                            be addressed to and answered by each juror in open court, as to whether he assented to said verdict. State v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 702</cite>, 163 S.E. 877 (1932).

                            When requested in apt time, a party is entitled to have the jury polled; that is, to have an inquiry directed to each juror in order to ascertain his assent to the announced verdict. When the jury is so polled and the verdict is challenged, the record
                            must affirmatively establish that each juror assented to the verdict entered. State v. Dow, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 644</cite>, 99 S.E.2d 860 (1957).

                            When requested in apt time, both defendant and the prosecuting attorney for the State have a legal right to demand that the jury be polled. Davis v. State, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 533</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 697 (1968).

                            The right to have the jury polled is surely one of the best safeguards for the protection of the accused, and as an incident to jury trials would seem to be a constitutional right, and its exercise only a mode, more satisfactory to the prisoner, of ascertaining
                            the fact that it is the verdict of the whole jury. Davis v. State, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 533</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 697 (1968); State v. Ingland, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 42</cite>, 178

                            The right to a poll of the jury in criminal actions is firmly established by this section and by statute. State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 191</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 398 (1991).

                            Polling of Jury Described. - The polling of the jury is a procedure whereby the jurors are asked individually the finding they have arrived at. The practice requires each juror to answer for himself, thus creating an individual response. Davis v. State,
                            <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 533</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 697 (1968).

                        <p>
                            A criminal defendant's right to have the jury polled is the right to have questions propounded to the jurors, individually, concerning whether each juror assented and still assents to the verdict tendered to the court. State v. Asbury,
                            <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 175 (1976).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The predominant purpose of the poll is to ascertain if the verdict as tendered by the jury is the unanimous verdict of a jury in open court, as prescribed by this section. Lipscomb v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 502</cite>,
                            142 S.E. 779 (1928).

                        <p>
                            The object of the jury poll is to give each juror an opportunity, before the verdict is recorded, to declare in open court his assent to the verdict which the foreman has returned, and thus to enable the court and the parties to ascertain with certainty
                            that a unanimous verdict has been in fact reached and that no juror has been coerced or induced to agree to a verdict to which he has not fully assented. Davis v. State, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 533</cite>,
                            160 S.E.2d 697 (1968); State v. Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 175 (1976); State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 300 S.E.2d 861 (1983).

                        <p>
                            By having the jury polled, a defendant can ascertain if there has been any misunderstanding of the requirement of unanimity by any juror. State v. Ingland, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 42</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 577 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rationale behind requiring that any polling of the jury be before dispersal is to ensure that nothing extraneous to the jury's deliberations can cause any of the jurors to change their minds. State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 191</cite>,
                            400 S.E.2d 398 (1991).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of polling the jury is to ensure that the jurors unanimously agree with and consent to the verdict at the time it is rendered. State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 191</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 398 (1991).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Only two questions are necessary to elicit whether the juror assented in the jury room and still assents in open court to the jury verdict. The first is: "Was this your verdict?" The addition of the second question "Is this now your verdict?" relates
                            to the same time period addressed in the third question, "Do you still agree and assent thereto?" The second and third questions refer to the present in-court state of mind of the juror and serve only to emphasize by repetition
                            that the crucial assent is the juror's assent to the verdict when he returns to the courtroom. State v. Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 175 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Right of Juror to Dissent. - When the verdict has been received from the foreman and has been entered, it is the duty of the clerk to cause the jury to hearken to their verdict as the court has it recorded, and to read it to them and say: "So say you
                            all?" At this time any juror may retract on the ground of conscientious scruples, mistake, fraud, or otherwise, and his dissent would then be effectual. Davis v. State, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 533</cite>,
                            160 S.E.2d 697 (1968).

                        <p>
                            Any juror may dissent from a verdict to which he has agreed in the jury room at any time before it is received and entered up. State v. Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 175 (1976).

                            Verdict Not Defective Where Juror Eventually Freely Assents. - A jury verdict is not defective if it appears that a juror eventually freely assented to the verdict. State v. Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>,

                            Jury's Free Accession to Verdict. - A verdict is not defective if a juror understood that he or she has a right to dissent and eventually freely assented to the verdict. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite>                            522, 300 S.E.2d 861 (1983).

                            Trial court did not coerce the jury's verdict by instructing the deadlocked jury on acting in concert, an instruction that should have originally been included, or inquiring into the numerical division of the jury's deadlock, as the court did not address

                            Defendant was found guilty by a unanimous jury where the trial judge was clear in the jury instructions that specific incident corresponded to a particular charge and that the jury must be unanimous in reaching a verdict on each charge. State v. Smith,

                            Where the State presented sufficient evidence to support the elements of each crime charged, defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury was not violated despite defendant's contention that neither the jury instructions nor the verdict sheets
                            required the jury to unanimously agree on the specific acts defendant committed to support each verdict. State v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 635 S.E.2d 455 (2006), cert.

                            When defendant was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sXIa39s14-316.1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-316.1</a></cite>, a jury did not have to unanimously
                            agree as to the act that defendant encouraged or assisted the minor involved in the crime to commit, for which the juvenile could be adjudicated a delinquent, as long as it agreed that he encouraged or assisted the juvenile
                            in the performance of such an act, because a conviction properly resulted from producing, promoting or contributing to any condition of delinquency, and the crime's gravamen was defendant's conduct, rather than that of the
                            juvenile. State v. Cousart, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 641 S.E.2d 372 (2007).

                            Defendant's convictions for felonious sexual act with a minor under the age of 13 and indecent liberties were erroneously reversed on the theory that it could not be said that the jury unanimously found defendant committed the same specific act to support
                            each conviction because, while different jurors might have found defendant committed different acts of misconduct, as the evidence showed more acts of misconduct than defendant was charged with, the jury unanimously agreed
                            that sexual misconduct occurred; thus, defendant's right to a unanimous verdict was not violated. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 406</cite>, 646 S.E.2d 362 (2007).

                            Because the trial court did not give any disjunctive instruction and, in any event, the unanimity cases relied upon by defendant did not apply to a charge of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, the trial court's instruction did not create a risk of a non-unanimous
                            verdict. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 656 S.E.2d 632, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 364</cite>, 664 S.E.2d 313 (2008).

                            Because the trial court determined that a juror, who had discussed the case with another juror in a bathroom attached to the juror room, had not been intimidated or received outside information and was in agreement with the verdict reached by the jury,
                            and no conversations had occurred outside the jury room, at most, the record established that the two jurors may have discussed the case between themselves; thus, there was no violation of the unanimity requirement. State v.

                            acts established an element of felony murder - namely, the commission of one of the several felonies enumerated in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa06s14-17" target="_blank">G.S. 14-17</a></cite>                            - the N.C.

                            Juror misconduct consisting of a juror's conversation about jury deliberations with a trial spectator that occurred after the jury's guilty verdict of murder but prior to sentencing was not grounds for a mistrial because there was no evidence that the

                            In defendant's trial on charges of taking indecent liberties with a child, defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 24, was not violated by the trial court's jury instructions and the verdict sheets because the trial court's instructions explicitly distinguished among the five indecent liberties charges and directed the jurors
                            to find defendant guilty on each count only if they determined that defendant had committed the requisite acts within the designated time periods, which were set forth in the indictments, and, as the court informed the jurors
                            in its instructions, each verdict sheet was paired with a particular indictment as indicated in the top right-hand corner of the verdict sheet State v. Comeaux, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 595, 741 S.E.2d 346

                            Because each of the alternative acts alleged to support defendant's failure to register as a sex offender satisfied the third element of the jury instruction, that defendant changed his address and failed to notify the sheriff in the requisite time period,
                            the requirement of jury unanimity was satisfied. State v. Crockett, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 767 S.E.2d 78 (2014).

                            Jury was not presented with either an expressly or functionally disjunctive instruction on the charge of discharging a firearm into occupied property because the defendant was indicted for firing only into the home of the victim; at trial, the State presented
                            evidence only suggesting that the home that was fired into was the victim's home; and the victim testified at length about the bullet holes and damage done to her home; thus, the defendant was not denied his right to a unanimous
                            jury verdict. State v. Charleston, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 671, 789 S.E.2d 513 (2016).

                            Defendant's arguments regarding jury unanimity lacked merit, as the jury instructions and the verdict sheets distinguished between the three sets of charges based upon the different locations where the offenses allegedly occurred and the State presented

                            to the trial judge and delivered the trial judge's written responses to the jury; however, there was no violation of defendant's right to a unanimous verdict because the trial court did not interact with or provide instructions

                            Systematic Exclusion of Members of Defendant's Race from Grand Jury Requires Quashing of Indictment. - This section of the Constitution requires the sustaining of a motion to quash an indictment of a defendant who proves that the members of his race have
                            been systematically excluded from the juries of the county in which he has been indicted. State v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 784</cite>, 42 S.E. 814 (1902).

                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 19 are to be so interpreted and that systematic exclusion from the grand jury of persons, otherwise qualified, because of their race, requires, upon motion duly made, the quashing of an indictment returned against
                            a member of that race by such grand jury, irrespective of the fact that all members of the grand jury were, themselves, qualified jurors. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).

                            Exclusion of Class of Persons from Jury Service Will Not Always Invalidate Indictment. - Even the complete exclusion, by State law, of a group or class of persons from eligibility for jury service will not make invalid an indictment by a grand jury, selected
                            in accordance with such State law, so long as there is no reasonable basis for the conclusion that the ineligible group or class would bring to the deliberations of the jury a point of view not otherwise represented upon it,
                            at least where the defendant is not a member of the excluded group. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).

                            Statistics of Underrepresentation. - Statistics concerning one jury pool, standing alone, are insufficient to show that underrepresentation of the defendant's race is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. State v. Bowman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 459</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 428 (1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040, 119 S. Ct. 2403, 144 L. Ed. 2d 802 (1999).

                            A jury venire of only 8.3% African-Americans, where the census for the county revealed that African-Americans comprised 16.15% of the county's population, did not encroach on the defendant's constitutional right to be tried by a jury of his or her peers,
                            where he did not allege systematic exclusion, only that the court should have taken affirmative steps to ensure that the jury venire called for his trial was racially proportionate; a 7.85% difference, standing alone, did not
                            render the jury venire constitutionally infirm. State v. Blakeney, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 287</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 799 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1117, 121 S. Ct. 868, 148 L. Ed. 2d 780

                            Showing Disproportionate Racial Representation. - To establish a prima facie case of disproportionate representation of a defendant's race in a jury venire, a defendant must show: (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a "distinctive" group in the
                            community; (2) that the group representation in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic
                            exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process. State v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 459</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 428 (1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040, 119 S. Ct. 2403, 144 L. Ed. 2d

                            Evidence of Racial Exclusion Held Insufficient. - Mere statement in defendant's brief that the systematic maneuverings of the prosecutor excluded persons of defendant's race from the jury, which was not supported by the record, failed to show that members
                            of defendant's race were systematically or arbitrarily excluded from the jury panel. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428
                            U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).

                        <p>
                            The defendant failed to make a prima facie case of racially motivated peremptory challenges, where the State was willing to accept 40% of the blacks tendered. State v. Abbott, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 475</cite>, 358
                            S.E.2d 365 (1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant found guilty of murder and robbery failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the State's use of its peremptory challenges where the State's questions during voir dire focused on the prospective juror's feelings about
                            capital punishment and the age of the juror, or his or her children, as compared with defendant's age; the venire persons were brought into the courtroom individually, so neither defendant nor the State knew how many black
                            citizens were present in the venire or whether a black citizen would be examined next, and three of the first four jurors seated were black, as were both defendant and the victim, thus diminishing the likelihood that racial
                            issues were inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 607</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 418 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 905, 110 S. Ct. 2587, 110

                        <p>
                            A small sample of 40 jurors from the master list of jurors of a county alone was insufficient to establish a systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury pool. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 712</cite>, 392
                            S.E.2d 78 (1990).

                            Use of a jury box containing only the names of property owners was not per se discriminatory and did not unfairly narrow the choice of jurors so as to impinge on defendant's statutory or constitutional rights. State v. Rogers,
                            <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 411</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 345 (1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1024, 90 S. Ct. 599, 24 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1970).

                            Exclusion of Age Group from Jury List. - The absence from the jury list of the names of persons between the ages of 18 and 21 during the period from July, 1971, the effective date of the amendment of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.009.html#t09a01s9-3" target="_blank">G.S. 9-3</a></cite>                            lowering the age requirement for jurors from 21 years to 18 years, and September, 1971, the date of defendants' trial, was not unreasonable and did not constitute systematic exclusion of this age group from jury service. State
                            v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).

                            Failure of defendant in a criminal prosecution to exhaust his peremptory challenges does not affect his right to attack an illegally constituted jury. State v. Emery, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 581</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 858

                            The erroneous allowance of an improper challenge for cause does not entitle the adverse party to a new trial, so long as only those who are competent and qualified to serve are actually empaneled upon the jury which tried his case. State v. Bernard,

                            Challenge of Jurors for Opposition to Death Penalty. - In a first degree murder prosecution, the trial court properly sustained the State's challenge for cause to each juror who stated that in no event and under no circumstances could he render a verdict

                            Purpose. - The purpose of conferring on the legislature power to provide means of trial other than by jury for petty misdemeanors is to avoid the inconvenience, expense and delay attendant upon indictment by the grand jury and the trial by the jury where
                            the parties choose to waive it, in the ordinary course of criminal procedure. State v. Crook, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 536</cite> (1884). See also, State v. Boykin, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 407</cite>,
                            191 S.E. 18 (1937).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Indictment by grand jury is dispensed with in the trial of petty misdemeanors under this section. State v. Lytle, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 738</cite>, 51 S.E. 66 (1905).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Legislature May Provide Other Means of Trial. - The legislature has power to designate the unlawful possession and transportation of intoxicants a petty misdemeanor and to provide means of trial for the offense other than by indictment and trial by jury.
                            State v. Shine, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 237</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 447 (1942).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The provisions of this section empower the legislature to provide means other than petit juries for the trial of petty misdemeanors, with the right of appeal. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d
                            283 (1952); State v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 68</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 461 (1956).

                        <p>
                            In Inferior Courts. - It is permissible under this section for the General Assembly to provide for the trial of petty misdemeanors in inferior courts with the right of appeal to the superior court. State v. Lytle, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 738</cite>,
                            51 S.E. 66 (1905); State v. Brittain, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 668</cite>, 57 S.E. 352 (1907); State v. Hyman, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 411</cite>, 79 S.E. 284 (1913); State v. Tate, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 373</cite>,

                        <p>
                            With Jury Trial De Novo on Appeal. - The only exception to the rule that nothing can be a conviction but the verdict of a jury is the constitutional authority granted the General Assembly to provide for the initial trial of misdemeanors in inferior courts
                            without a jury, with trial de novo by a jury upon appeal. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 74</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 189 (1971), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d
                            112 (1974).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The constitutional right of a defendant charged with a misdemeanor to have a jury trial is not infringed by the fact that he has first to submit to trial without a jury in the district court and then appeal to superior court in order to obtain a jury
                            trial. State v. Sherron, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 166 S.E.2d 836 (1969).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Right to Jury Trial Is Preserved by Requirement of Trial De Novo on Appeal. - The right of a trial by jury in a criminal action is preserved to the accused by the statutory requirement of a trial de novo in the superior court on appeal from a court of
                            subordinate jurisdiction, and conviction in the superior court cannot be had unless upon the verdict of the jury, in accordance with the provisions of this section of the Constitution. State v. Pulliam,
                            <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 681</cite>, 114 S.E. 394 (1922).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The constitutional guaranty of a jury trial is met by the right of appeal which is given from an inferior court, in all cases, to the superior court. State v. Lytle, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 738</cite>, 51 S.E. 66 (1905).
                            See also, State v. Hyman, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 411</cite>, 79 S.E. 284 (1913).

                        <p>
                            Jury Trials May Be Abolished in Inferior Courts. - Where defendants have the right to appeal to the superior court and obtain a trial de novo before a petit jury, the General Assembly may abolish jury trials in an inferior court by a direct enactment
                            to that effect without transgressing this section. State v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 205</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 602 (1953).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Waiver of Right of Appeal. - A person on trial for a misdemeanor in an inferior court with right of appeal to the superior court may waive his constitutional right to a trial by jury by consenting to the judgment therein entered, or by not appealing therefrom,
                            and the fact that afterwards he employs an attorney and moves for appeal within the time allowed by the applicable statute will not affect the fact that he had personally acquiesced in the judgment entered. State v. Lakey,
                            <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 571</cite>, 132 S.E. 570 (1926).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where, in a prosecution in the recorder's court for wilful failure to support his illegitimate child, defendant complied with the terms of the suspended judgment by making two payments according to its terms, paying the costs of court, and executing a
                            compliance bond pursuant to the terms of the judgment, he would be deemed to have knowingly and intelligently waived his statutory right to appeal to the superior court. State v. Cooke, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 201</cite>,
                            150 S.E.2d 226 (1966).

                            Appellate Court May Increase Punishment in Trial De Novo. - Upon appeal from an inferior court for a trial de novo in the superior court, the superior court may impose punishment in excess of that imposed in the inferior court provided the punishment
                            imposed does not exceed the statutory maximum. State v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 111</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 789 (1972).

                            Transfer of Untried Misdemeanors. - For case holding that statutes purporting to authorize the transfer of untried misdemeanor cases from an inferior court to the superior court and the initial trial of such transferred cases in the superior court upon
                            the warrant of the inferior court repugnant to the declaration inherent in the second sentence of this section, that a person charged with the commission of a misdemeanor cannot be put on trial in the superior court upon the
                            warrant of an inferior court unless he has been tried upon such warrant in the inferior court and has appealed from that court to the superior court, see State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>,

                            This Section Applicable to Actions Respecting Property Only. - Though this section contains no such qualifications, it has been construed to apply only to actions respecting property in which the right to a jury trial existed either at common law, or
                            by statute before the 1868 Constitution became operative; for actions created since then, the right to a jury trial depends upon statutory authority. State ex rel.

                            Cap on Punitive Damages. - Section 1D-25, which places a cap on punitive damages, does not violate injured parties' rights to a jury trial, because their right to punitive damages is not a property interest, and they only have a right to a civil jury
                            trial concerning property. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 562 S.E.2d 82 (2002), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

   </span> 13 merely establishes the form and procedure for the trial of all civil actions, including the procedure of having issues of fact decided by a jury in what were formerly equity proceedings; to determine whether there
                            exists a constitutional right to trial by jury of a particular cause of action, one looks to this section, which ensures that there is a right to trial by jury where the underlying cause of action existed at the time of adoption
                            of the 1868 Constitution, regardless of whether the action was formerly a proceeding in equity. Kiser v. Kiser, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 502</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 487 (1989).

                            premised upon a preliminary determination by the trial judge that there indeed existed genuine issues of fact and credibility which required submission to the jury, and, in certain cases, credibility was manifest as a matter
                            of law, but no general rule could be stated to determine whether credibility was manifest in a particular case. Dockery v. Hocutt, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 210</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 431 (2003).

                            Trial court did not err in denying the one child's request for a jury trial on the one child's motion for sanctions against the second child and wife regarding the counterclaim that they filed; the motion for sanctions was not an action regarding a property
                            right, and thus the one child did not have a constitutional right to a jury, and in any event the evidence did not support the entry of sanctions. Hill v.

                            In a case involving a promissory note release, a home buyer unsuccessfully argued that the trial court erred by directing a verdict in favor of an estate administrator on the issue of whether the release was supported by consideration when the administrator
                            had the burden of proof on that issue at trial and that his constitutional right under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 25 to a jury trial was violated because, by granting the administrator's motion for a directed verdict at the close of the administrator's evidence, the trial court usurped the jury's responsibility by preventing
                            him from presenting evidence and calling witnesses. The right to a jury trial was not absolute, and because the administrator established his claim through documentary evidence, which the parties stipulated was authentic and
                            correct, the trial court properly directed the verdict in favor of the administrator despite the administrator having the burden of proof at trial. Burton v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 81, 689 S.E.2d

                            Granting a buyer summary judgment that the buyer owned certain real property did not violate a creditor's manager's jury trial right because (1) that right was subject to a determination that there was a genuine issue of fact to be decided at a trial,
                            and (2) no such issue existed. Sullivan v. Pugh, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 691, 814 S.E.2d 117 (2018), cert. denied, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 2387, 203 L. Ed. 2d 682 (U.S. 2019).

                            Right Applies Only in Cases Involving Fact Issues. - This section does not confer the right to demand the intervention of a jury absolutely and unqualifiedly, but only in cases involving issues of fact. McQueen v. Peoples Nat'l Bank,

                            The constitutional right to trial by jury is not absolute; rather, it is premised upon a preliminary determination by the trial judge that there indeed exist genuine issues of fact and credibility which require submission to the jury. Therefore, the right
                            to jury trial is not an impediment to directing a verdict for that party with the burden of proof where the credibility of the movant's evidence is manifest as a matter of law. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Burnette,

                            pleadings, but it is not required that a trial by jury be had at each stage of the proceedings when this right has elsewhere therein been properly safeguarded by statute. Board of County Comm'rs v. George,

                            Court May Not Determine Fact Issues. - Right to a jury trial is guaranteed by this section, and where the parties do not consent to trial by the court, the court may not determine, prior to the introduction of evidence, an issue of fact joined by the
                            pleadings. Hershey Corp. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 122</cite>, 176 S.E. 265 (1934).

                        <p>
                            It was error for the trial court to determine issues of fact raised by the pleadings in the absence of waiver of the constitutional and statutory right to a trial by jury, there being no question of reference. Sparks v. Sparks,

                            authority to enter an order affirming the order of the assistant clerk of the superior court, which in effect was a determination by the judge of the issue of fact raised by the pleadings and a finding by him that money deposited
                            in the office of the clerk of the superior court was funds belonging to decedent and an order that said money be distributed to the administrator c.t.a. of her last will and testament. In re Estate of Wallace,

                            When Judgment of Dismissal Offends Plaintiff's Right to Jury Trial. - Judgment of dismissal of plaintiff's action offends against plaintiff's constitutional right of jury trial where these factors come into focus: (1) The record discloses no stipulation
                            by which jury trial was waived or consent was given for the court to find facts; (2) the plaintiff's evidence was sufficient to make out a prima facie case in accordance with the allegations of the complaint; (3) the defendant
                            offered no evidence; (4) the plaintiff's evidence does not establish the truth of the defendant's affirmative defense. Ingle v. McCurry, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 65</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 745 (1955).

                        <p>
                            Where there is more than a scintilla of evidence to sustain the allegations of the complaint, the case must be submitted to the jury, its sufficiency to warrant a verdict for plaintiff being for the determination of the jury, subject only to the discretionary
                            power of the trial court to set the verdict aside in proper cases, and a strict adherence to this rule is necessary to preserve the right of trial by jury guaranteed under this section. Fox v. Asheville Army Store, Inc.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 187</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 550 (1939).

                            Burden of Proof Between the Parties. - The rules of law as to the burden of proof between the parties to litigation respecting damages to property resulting from negligence is one of substantial right guaranteed by the federal Constitution, and more emphatically
                            by this section of the State Constitution. McDowell v. Norfolk S.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 571</cite>, 120 S.E. 205, 42 A.L.R. 857 (1923).

                            Power of Court to Increase Jury Award by Additur. - While it may be suggested that the practice of additur deprives a defendant of his constitutional right to a jury trial, guaranteed by this section, the obvious answer is that the defendant may waive
                            that right, which he does when he consents to pay the additur, since in this State the parties to a civil action have a right to waive a jury trial. Caudle v. Swanson, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 249</cite>,
                            103 S.E.2d 357 (1958).

                        <p>
                            Compulsory Reference. - Every litigant has the constitutional right of trial by jury unless he voluntarily waives it, and, in case of a compulsory reference made to facilitate the trial of a cause, he may renew his demand for a jury trial by excepting
                            to the report of the referee and pointing out the findings so excepted to as a basis for issues. State ex rel. Wilson v. Featherstone, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 446</cite>, 27 S.E. 124 (1897).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A compulsory reference, under former G.S. 1-189, did not deprive either party of his constitutional right to a trial by jury of the issues of fact arising on the pleadings, but such trial was only upon the written evidence taken before the referee. Resort
                            Dev. Co. v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 69</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 813 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Although when a court orders a compulsory reference, a party preserves his right to trial by complying with the procedural steps outlined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                            Rule 53, the party is entitled to trial by jury only if the evidence before the reference was sufficient to raise an issue of fact. Fauchette v. Zimmerman, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 265, 338 S.E.2d 804 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Admission of hearsay evidence does not violate the confrontation clause when declarant is unavailable to testify and his statement bears adequate indicia of reliability. Thus, in a trial for taking indecent liberties with a four-year-old child, admission
                            of evidence admissible under established exception to the hearsay rule did not violate defendant's right of confrontation under this section. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                            584, 367 S.E.2d 139 (1988).

                            Polling Jury in Civil Actions. - Under this section, the losing party in a civil action may demand a polling of the jury upon the return of the verdict, as a matter of right. Culbreth v. Borden Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 208</cite>,
                            126 S.E. 419 (1925).

                        <p>
                            Upon the coming in of the verdict in a civil action, either party to the action has the constitutional right to have the jury polled before accepting the verdict as a unanimous one. In re Will of Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 638</cite>,

                            Waiver of Right to Jury Trial Strictly Construed. - It is a general rule, since the right of trial by jury is highly favored, that waivers of the right are always strictly construed and are not to be lightly inferred or extended by implication, whether
                            with respect to a civil or criminal case. Mathias v. Brumsey, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 558, 219 S.E.2d 646 (1975), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 140</cite>, 220 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            Waiver Will Not Be Presumed. - There can be no presumption of a waiver of trial by jury where such a trial is provided for by law. Thus, in the absence of an express agreement or consent, a waiver of the right to a jury trial will not be presumed or inferred.
                            Indeed, every reasonable presumption should be made against waiver. Mathias v. Brumsey, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 558, 219 S.E.2d 646 (1975), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 140</cite>,

                            How Jury Trial May Be Waived. - A party may waive his right to jury trial by (1) failing to appear at the trial, (2) written consent filed with the clerk, (3) oral consent entered in the minutes of the court, (4) failing to demand a jury trial pursuant
                            to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 38(b). Sykes v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).

                            Waiver Where Fiduciary Relationship Present. - Although individuals may waive their right to a civil jury trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 25 by agreement, any waiver must be examined cautiously, especially in situations in which a fiduciary relationship is present. King v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 340, 737 S.E.2d 802 (2013).

                            There is no constitutional impediment to arbitration agreements. Miller v. Two State Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 455 S.E.2d 678 (1995).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An agreement to arbitrate a dispute is not an unenforceable contract requiring waiver of a jury; thus, the trial court erred in concluding that because arbitration provision did not provide for trial of facts by a jury that it was unconscionable and unenforceable
                            under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.022B.html#t22Ba02s22B-10" target="_blank">G.S. 22B-10</a></cite>, and in violation of N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            The right to a jury trial under the law of this State does not conflict with any of the substantive provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; therefore, State law would control and plaintiff was entitled to have factual controversy in

                            Since Ownership Is Not in Issue in Eminent Domain. - This section is a constitutional guaranty of jury trial when the issue determinative of the rights of the litigants is: "Who owns the land, plaintiff or defendant?" This issue does not arise when the
                            State, or its agency, exercises the power of eminent domain. The phrase "eminent domain" by definition admits condemnor did not own, but took or appropriated the property of another for a public purpose. Wescott v. State Hwy.

                            Equitable Distribution Action. - No right to bring an action for equitable distribution of marital property existed prior to the adoption of the equitable distribution statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-20" target="_blank">G.S. 50-20</a></cite>                            and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-21" target="_blank">G.S. 50-21</a></cite>, and the language of the statutes themselves create no new right to trial by jury; therefore, there is no right
                            to trial by jury for such an action under the Constitution of North Carolina. Kiser v. Kiser, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 502</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 487 (1989).

                            Date of Separation in the Context of Equitable Distribution - In the context of equitable distribution, defendant does not have a right to jury trial on the issue of the date of separation when he seeks a divorce from bed and board. No such constitutional
                            right exists nor has the legislature statutorily provided for such a right when it drafted the equitable distribution statutes although the date of separation is a jury-triable issue within the absolute divorce context. McCall

                            Condemnation. - Where a matter was called for hearing pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.136.html#t136a09s136-108" target="_blank">G.S. 136-108</a></cite> in a condemnation action with no jury, this hearing
                            did not infringe upon the landowner's right to a jury trial as provided by the North Carolina and United States Constitutions. DOT v. Wolfe, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 449 S.E.2d 11 (1994).

                            Denial of a co-owner's motion for a jury trial in his appeal from a clerk's order allowing a foreclosure was proper because, inter alia, N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 25 guaranteed the right to a jury trial only for cases where the right existed when the Constitution of 1868 was adopted, and there was no right to a jury in foreclosure proceedings when the Constitution of 1868
                            was adopted. In re Foreclosure of Elkins, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 226, 667 S.E.2d 259 (2008).

                            Attorney Disciplinary Proceedings. - This State has never had a statute which expressly conferred upon an attorney the right to a trial by jury in a judicial disciplinary or disbarment proceeding. Since no such right existed at common law, or by statute
                            at the time the State Constitution was adopted, and is not now provided for by statute, an attorney's motion for a trial by jury is properly denied.

                            The legislature in 1969 had absolutely no intention of providing a constitutional right to jury trial for attorneys in disciplinary proceedings when it submitted this section to the people. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont,

                            No Right to Jury Trial in Action to Determine Attorneys' Fees Under Quantum Meruit - Trial court did not err in denying a law firm's request for a jury trial on the reasonable value of the attorneys who had provided legal services for a client under a
                            contingency fee agreement and who were then discharged by the client under N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Shareholder's Derivative Actions. - Although a litigant's right to have a jury try issues of fact concerning the merits of the action initiated by the filing of a derivative suit complaint is guaranteed by the Constitution of North Carolina, the procedure
                            required by former G.S. 55-55(c) did not exist before the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, and therefore no State constitutional right exists to a trial by jury of factual issues that might arise during the course of the
                            proceedings required under this section. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                            No Right to Jury Trial Under Coastal Area Management Act. - In an action brought by State seeking preliminary injunction to require removal of sign and compliance with Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA), sign company was not entitled to trial by jury
                            since it had not asserted "right and remedy" existing when State Constitution was adopted and since CAMA did not provide statutory right to jury trial. State ex rel.

                            Proceedings before the judge to remove a prosecuting attorney from office for willful misconduct or maladministration in office do not require an issue to be submitted to the jury, as such office is not a property right under the provisions of this section.

                            An action under G.S. 90-112.1 is in the nature of an action for replevin and is in essence a civil action; as such, the right to a jury trial, if any, is governed by this section of the Constitution, and thus, defendant was not entitled to a trial by
                            jury for her remission action. State v. Honaker, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 431 S.E.2d 869 (1993).

                            This section does more than protect individuals from unequal treatment; the people of this State have declared in this provision that they will not tolerate the corruption of their juries by racism, sexism, and similar forms of irrational prejudice. State

                            The right to trial by jury carries with it the right to be tried before a body selected in such a manner that competing and divergent interests and perspectives in the community are reflected rather than reproduced absolutely. State v. Bowman,

                            Statistics of Underrepresentation. - Statistics concerning one jury pool, standing alone, are insufficient to show that underrepresentation of the defendant's race is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. State v. Bowman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 459</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 428 (1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040, 119 S. Ct. 2403, 144 L. Ed. 2d 802 (1999).

                        <p>
                            A jury venire of only 8.3% African-Americans, where the census for the county revealed that African-Americans comprised 16.15% of the county's population, did not encroach on the defendant's constitutional right to be tried by a jury of his or her peers,
                            where he did not allege systematic exclusion, only that the court should have taken affirmative steps to ensure that the jury venire called for his trial was racially proportionate; a 7.85% difference, standing alone, did not
                            render the jury venire constitutionally infirm. State v. Blakeney, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 287</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 799 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1117, 121 S. Ct. 868, 148 L. Ed. 2d 780

                            Prima Facie Showing of Intentional Discrimination. - As with race-based "Batson" claims, a party alleging gender discrimination must make a prima facie showing of intentional discrimination before the party exercising the preemptory challenge of a juror
                            is required to explain the basis for the strike. State v. Gaines, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 647</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 396, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 900, 118 S. Ct. 248, 139 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1997).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Case was remanded for a Batson hearing after the trial court erred by concluding that the defendant failed to present a prima facie showing during voir dire to challenge the prosecutor's peremptory strikes of prospective minority jurors, as a numerical
                            analysis of the prosecutor's peremptory strikes, while not conclusive of the issue, called into question the prosecutor's conduct. State v. Barden, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 316</cite>, 572
                            S.E.2d 108 (2002).

                        <p>
                            To make out a prima facie case of discrimination. a defendant need only show that the relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors solely because of their race. State v. Quick,
                            <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 141</cite>, 462 S.E.2d 186 (1995).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trial court properly denied defendant's Batson challenge based on defendant's failure to make a prima facie showing of racial discrimination; a prima facie case was not made out simply because the juror struck by the peremptory challenge and the defendant
                            were both African-Americans. State v. Lawrence, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 1</cite>, 530 S.E.2d 807 (2000).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prima Facie Showing Moot. - Trial court erred in finding that defendant failed to make out a prima facie showing of discrimination, as the trial court heard the State's reasons for striking the jurors prior to making a ruling on defendant's Batson objection,
                            which made the issue of whether he made a prima facie showing moot; the court then had to consider whether the State met its burden of providing a race-neutral explanation for its peremptory challenges. State v. James,
                            <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 346, 750 S.E.2d 851 (2013).

                        <p>
                            Showing of Disproportionate Racial Representation. - To establish a prima facie case of disproportionate representation of a defendant's race in a jury venire, a defendant must show: (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a "distinctive" group in
                            the community; (2) that the group representation in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this under representation is due
                            to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process. State v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 459</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 428 (1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040, 119 S. Ct. 2403,

                            Peremptory Challenge Test Based on Race Same as Federal Test. - The test to determine whether peremptory challenges were exercised in a racially discriminatory manner is the same under the North Carolina Constitution as it is under the United States Constitution.
                            State v. Floyd, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 101</cite>, 468 S.E.2d 46, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 896, 117 S. Ct. 241, 136 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1996).

                        <p>
                            Racial Neutrality of Peremptory Strike. - Whether an explanation for a peremptory strike of a prospective juror being challenged as racially discriminatory is indeed neutral depends on whether, accepting the proffered reason as true, the challenge constitutes
                            purposeful discrimination as a matter of law. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 509 S.E.2d 462 (1998).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Peremptory Challenges Based on Race Proscribed. - This section proscribes peremptory challenges to jurors in civil cases as well as criminal cases on the basis of race. Jackson v. Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 584</cite>,
                            364 S.E.2d 416 (1988).

                        <p>
                            The State's explanation for using a peremptory strike, in response to a challenge that it was racially motivated, must be clear, reasonably specific, and related to the particular case to be tried, although it need not rise to the level justifying exercise
                            of a challenge for cause. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 509 S.E.2d 462 (1998).
                            <br />

                            Selection of Grand Jury Foreman Must Meet Racially Neutral Standard. - A method of selecting a grand jury foreman that meets the racially neutral standard must ensure that all grand jurors are considered by the presiding judge for his selection and that

                            A black defendant may make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the grand jury foreman's selection by showing either (1) that the selection procedure itself was not racially neutral, or (2) that for a substantial period in the past, relatively
                            few blacks have served in the position of foreman even though a substantial number have been selected to serve as members of grand juries. The State may rebut such a prima facie case on remand by offering evidence that the
                            process used in selecting the grand jury foreman was in fact racially neutral. State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 297</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 622 (1987).

                            To Establish Prima Facie Case of Racial Discrimination in Selection of Grand Jury Foreman. - A black defendant may make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the grand jury foreman's selection by showing either (1) that the selection procedure
                            itself was not racially neutral, or (2) that for a substantial period in the past, relatively few blacks have served in the position of foreman even though a substantial number have been selected to serve as members of grand
                            juries. The State may rebut such a prima facie case on remand by offering evidence that the process used in selecting the grand jury foreman was in fact racially neutral. State v. Cofield,

                            Evidence to Show Pretextual Nature of Prosecutor's Explanation. - In North Carolina in a claim of racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, the defendant may put on additional evidence before the trial court's final ruling to prove that the
                            prosecutor's explanations are pretextual. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 1</cite>, 452 S.E.2d 245 (1994), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 833, 116 S. Ct. 109, 133 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1995), overruled

                            Disparate Treatment of Prospective Jurors Not Dispositive. - Although the prosecutor claimed to have struck one of the black jurors because of her family's involvement with crime, another because of inconsistent statements and a third because of the juror's
                            views on the death penalty, but, according to defendant, the prosecutor passed two white jurors with criminal backgrounds, one white juror who made inconsistent statements and another who expressed reservations about imposing
                            the death penalty, disparate treatment of prospective jurors was not necessarily dispositive on the issue of discriminatory intent. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 1</cite>, 452

                            Excuse Based on Age. - Statutory scheme allowing trial judge to exercise his discretion to excuse jurors over the age of 65 has a rational basis and is not constitutionally infirm. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 420</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Circumstances Collectively Showed Discrimination. - After a black woman was seated for examination during voir dire, the prosecutor asked the clerk if there was a white male out there; the prosecutor briefly questioned the woman and then peremptorily
                            challenged her; the woman was excused and a white man was called for examination and later became the jury foreperson. Standing alone, the prosecutor's peremptory challenge of the black woman would not amount to a prima facie
                            showing of purposeful discrimination. The prosecutor's question of the clerk prior to his examination of the black woman, however, is a relevant circumstance which, when combined with the prosecutor's subsequent peremptory
                            challenge of the black woman, raises an inference of purposeful discrimination on the prosecutor's part thereby establishing a prima facie showing. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite>                            375, 410 S.E.2d 76 (1991).

                            Race Neutral Reasons for Striking African-American Jurors. - State's reasons for using six of its peremptory strikes on African-American jurors, including unresponsiveness, deceit, failure to make eye contact, alleged acquaintance with defendant's former
                            girlfriend, an extensive history of purchasing pawn tickets, and prior employment at the convenience store where the incident occurred, were race-neutral. State v. Pender, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite>                            233, 720 S.E.2d 836 (2012).

                            Prosecutor's Impression that Juror Out of Touch with Reality. - A peremptory strike of a prospective juror was without racially discriminatory intent where the prosecutor stated that it was based on the prospective juror's limited education, his limited
                            ability to read and write, his failure to answer all questions on the juror questionnaire, his statement that he had never considered his views on the death penalty until that day, and the prosecutor's impression that the juror
                            may be "out of touch with reality." State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 122</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 334 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 840, 122 S. Ct. 96, 151 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2001).

                            Race or Religion of Defendant Different from Excluded Juror. - Discrimination in selecting juries so strongly taints the judicial system that any proceeding in which it appears is fatally flawed; for this reason, the fact that the defendant's race or
                            religion differs from the excluded person's is irrelevant. State v. Eason, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 730</cite>, 445 S.E.2d 917 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1096, 115 S. Ct. 764, 130 L. Ed.

                        <p>
                            Challenge Not Pretextual. - Defendant's proffered reasons for challenging a black juror were not pretextual where the juror had been convicted on six occasions of issuing worthless checks and was not forthright about her convictions upon questioning.
                            State v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 172</cite>, 472 S.E.2d 730 (1996).

                            Peremptory Challenge by Defendant in Criminal Trial. - Trial court did not commit clear error in sustaining the State of North Carolina's objection to defendant's peremptory challenges during jury selection, when the State alleged purposeful discrimination
                            on the basis of gender and race. The court considered defendant and the murder victims being black, the credibility of defense counsel, the context of the peremptory strike by defendant against a white prospective juror, and
                            defendant's pretrial motion to prevent the State from exercising peremptory strikes against prospective black jurors. State v. Hurd, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 784 S.E.2d 528,
                            cert. denied, 792 S.E.2d 521, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 748 (2016).

                        <p>
                            Peremptory Challenges Upheld. - In a capital case, peremptory challenges to 5 of 6 potential black jurors were upheld where the State met its burden of coming forward with neutral, nonracial explanations for each peremptory challenge. State v. Robinson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 1</cite>, 409 S.E.2d 288 (1991).

                        <p>
                            No purposeful racial discrimination occurred in the peremptory challenges of black jurors where trial court's ruling was supported by the trial court's findings of fact, which were supported by the record. State v. Thomas,
                            <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 423</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 141 (1991), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 824, 118 S. Ct. 84, 139 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1997).

                        <p>
                            The State did not discriminate on the basis of race in exercising its peremptory challenges against two jurors, where the State provided race-neutral reasons for the peremptory challenges of both jurors, namely that one was young, within the age range
                            of defendants, and had a sister who was also within the age range of defendants, and that the other had been convicted of driving while impaired and had a father with a prior conviction for robbery for which he had served six
                            years, and where, in selecting the 12 jurors and four alternates, the State exercised 27 peremptory challenges, only four of which were against African-Americans. This ratio represented a percentage of African-Americans equivalent
                            to the percentage of African-Americans in the jury pool. Moreover, during jury selection, the State made no comments which would support an inference of discrimination. State v. Golphin, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 364</cite>,
                            533 S.E.2d 168 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 931, 121 S. Ct. 1379, 1380, 149 L. Ed. 2d 305 (2001), cert. dismissed, without prejudice, 805 S.E.2d 698, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 900 (2017), cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 587</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Murder defendant failed to show that jurors were improperly excluded on the basis of race, given one juror's opposition to the death penalty, another juror's potential sympathy for defendant, and a third juror's employment counseling inmates. State v.
                            Fair, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 131</cite>, 552 S.E.2d 568 (2001).

                            Defendant's Batson challenge to the jury, under principles of racial discrimination, gender discrimination, and racial-gender discrimination combined, were carefully evaluated under the various prongs of Batson and found not to have violated U.S. Const.,
                            Amend. VI and N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 26, where the trial court found that defendant established a prima facie case that the peremptory challenges were exercised on the basis of race, but thereafter, the prosecutor's reasons were found to be racially
                            neutral; the court found no purposeful discrimination in the challenges made by the prosecutor, and challenges to the other forms of discriminatory challenge lacked merit because there was insufficient proof that a cognizable
                            group had been singled out for exclusion. State v. Wiggins, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 584 S.E.2d 303 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 910, 124 S. Ct. 1617, 158 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2004).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            State's preemptory challenges, which did not violate Batson because they were race-neutral, were based on potential juror's (1) strong and absolute opposition to death penalty, (2) concern for undue sympathy for the defendant, (3) pregnancy making it
                            difficult to take a life when carrying a life, (4) prison ministry dealing with violent criminals to reform them, (5) rheumatoid arthritis, (6) nervousness about thought of having to impose death penalty, and (7) being homemaker
                            with child with special needs and her sympathies. State v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 1</cite>, 603 S.E.2d 93 (2004).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court did nor err in denying defendant's Batson challenge to the State's exercising of a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective African-American juror because the State's race neutral explanations for using a peremptory challenge to remove
                            a prospective African-American juror - that her responses on death penalty were weak, that she admitted she might develop sympathy toward defendant, and that she made a misrepresentation on her questionnaire - complied with
                            Batson. State v. Alvarez, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 487, 608 S.E.2d 371 (2005).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of racial discrimination with regard to the State's preemptory challenge of a prospective juror which was granted in defendant's trial for first-degree murder and the trial court, therefore, did not err in
                            overruling defendant's Batson objection because, despite the juror being the first African American to have been challenged, other factors supported the trial court's ruling such as the fact that the victim and the State's
                            three critical witnesses were all African American. Therefore, the case was not particularly susceptible to racial discrimination and the State neither made any racially motivated statements nor asked any racially motivated
                            questions of the prospective juror. State v. Augustine, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 709</cite>, 616 S.E.2d 515 (2005).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            State's peremptory challenges to three African-American prospective jurors did not establish a pattern of discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 26, when viewed in conjunction with other relevant facts. When defendant made his Batson objection, the State had accepted two out of five, or forty percent, of eligible African-American jurors; and the State's statements
                            and questions during voir dire appeared evenhanded and not racially motivated. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 514</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 239 (2008), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 851, 130 S. Ct. 129, 175 L. Ed. 2d 84
                            (2009).

                        <p>
                            In an appeal as of right with regard to the imposition of a sentence of death against a defendant following a jury trial, which resulted in his conviction for the first-degree murder of a police officer while in the performance of his duties, the defendant's
                            claim of gender bias in the State's peremptory challenge of a prospective juror was not an exceptional circumstance calling for invocation since the defendant had not objected to any of the State's peremptory challenges on
                            the ground of discrimination against women. State v. Maness, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 261</cite>, 677 S.E.2d 796 (2009).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In an action in which defendant appealed his conviction for First-degree murder and his death sentence, the State did not improperly use peremptory challenges to strike prospective African-American jurors on the basis of race where: (1) the numbers did
                            not suggest a systematic effort on the part of the State to prevent African-Americans from serving as jurors; and (2) the State's proffered race-neutral reasons were not pretextual. State v. Waring,
                            <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 443</cite>, 701 S.E.2d 615 (2010).

                        <p>
                            Findings did not indicate that the State acted with racial purpose, and the trial court's ultimate decision to dismiss defendant's Batson objection was upheld. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 346,

                            Trial court did not err in denying defendant's Batson challenge, as when questioned about his thoughts concerning the death penalty, a black juror stated he would not agree with the death penalty under any circumstances, elaborating he was a pastor and
                            agreeing with the death penalty would make him a hypocrite, and that he might hypothetically agree to the death penalty if a defendant chopped someone into pieces and burned them. State v. McQueen,

                            Peremptory strike against a second black juror after he minimized his criminal history, avoided questions regarding his family member's criminal charges, had spoken with a witness on multiple occasions and had a great-niece who worked for the witness
                            did not violate Batson. State v. McQueen, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 790 S.E.2d 897 (2016).

                            Peremptory strike against a black female did not violate Batson based on her thought about the death penalty, failure to disclose past criminal charges, her reservations about whether law enforcement treated her brother fairly, and her lack of eye contact
                            when asked whether her brother's prosecution would affect her ability to be fair and impartial to both sides of the case. State v. McQueen, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 790 S.E.2d

                            The defendant did not make a prima facie showing of racially motivated peremptory challenges where the State accepted seven of the 17 black veniremen tendered and the majority of the jury which tried the defendant was black. State v. Allen,
                            <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 208</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 855 (1988), sentence vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 1463, 108 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1990), in light of, 281 U.S. 700, 50 S. Ct. 353,

                            Defendant, found guilty of murder and robbery, failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the State's use of its peremptory challenges, where the State's questions during voir dire focused on the prospective juror's feelings about
                            capital punishment and the age of the juror, or his or her children, as compared with defendant's age; the venire persons were brought into the courtroom individually, so neither defendant nor the State knew how many black
                            citizens were present in the venire or whether a black citizen would be examined next; and three of the first four jurors seated were black, as were both defendant and the victim, thus diminishing the likelihood that racial
                            issues were inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 607</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 418 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 905, 110 S. Ct. 2587, 110

                        <p>
                            Defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the jury where the jury consisted of ten white jurors and two black jurors, the only peremptory challenge exercised by the prosecutor excused a black man from
                            the jury, but the prosecutor also accepted the two women who were the other black members of the jury venire, he accepted one at the same time he challenged the black male juror, indicating that he was not attempting to strike
                            all blacks, and he did not move to strike any jurors for cause, thus, accepting 66% of the black potential jurors. State v. Ross, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 280</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 556 (1994).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The prosecutor's peremptory excusal of two of four black jurors in a case involving sexual offenses against a white woman by a black man was not sufficient, standing alone, to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination and require the prosecutor
                            to come forward with race-neutral explanations. State v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 141</cite>, 462 S.E.2d 186 (1995).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The prosecutor gave race neutral reasons for his peremptory strikes of black jurors in a capital murder case, where one was excused for his criminal record, body language, and lack of candor, and another because she was confused, she did not think that
                            wife-beating was a serious crime, and she had a relative in jail. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 509 S.E.2d 462 (1998).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though the prosecutor's reasons for peremptory strikes of two black females were suspect, in that he initially identified them as two "black" females, the defense failed to object, and the stated reasons that the prospects were health care providers
                            and close to defendant's age were adequate to support the strikes. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 509 S.E.2d 462 (1998).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant failed to establish a prima facie case that the State exercised its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner during the jury selection process where the victims were black, the State's key witnesses were black, the prosecutor
                            made no racially motivated remarks, and the jury was composed of four black males, one black female, three white males, and four white females, with one black male and one black female as alternates. State v. Smith,
                            <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 251</cite>, 524 S.E.2d 28, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 862, 121 S. Ct. 151, 148 L. Ed. 2d 100 (2000).

                            Defendants did not meet their burden of showing purposeful discrimination in the selection of jurors, due to the racially diverse composition of the jury and the trial court's finding that the prosecution's explanations for striking of prospective jurors
                            because of conduct were not pretextual. State v. Tirado, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 551</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 515 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 909, 125 S. Ct. 1600, 161 L. Ed. 2d 285 (2005).

                            Under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, as well as N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 26, the State used a peremptory challenge to excuse an African-American prospective juror, however, the State offered race neutral reasons for the excusal, even though other potential jurors may have given similar
                            answers, that she (1) was against killing whether it was legal or illegally and that her opposition was based on religious, moral, and philosophical beliefs she had held since childhood, and (2) had a brother who had previously
                            been convicted of armed robbery; the trial judge was in the best position to resolve this issue, having heard and seen the responses of the prospective juror, including her facial expressions, tone of voice, reactions, and
                            other nuances that were not subject to translation when the appeals court reviewed the cold record on appeal. State v. McClain, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 610 S.E.2d 783 (2005).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant's Batson argument regarding jurors stricken by the State failed because he failed to make a prima facie case that the State's challenges were racially motivated, and the court found that the State clearly agreed with the trial court's findings
                            related to the race of the five identified prospective jurors. State v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 821 S.E.2d 476 (2018).

                            Findings Adhered to Requirements of Inquiry. - Trial court's findings adhered to the requirements of a Batson inquiry, as the trial court made specific findings as to race, the prevalence of minority jurors being dismissed, and the State's reasoning for
                            its use of peremptory challenges, plus defendant's chance to rebut was also considered. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 346, 750 S.E.2d 851 (2013).

                        <p>
                            Trial court applied the correct criteria when it approved a jury panel of eight black jurors and four white jurors with three alternates selected, one of whom was black and two of whom were white, and heard arguments regarding the prosecutor's reverse-Batson
                            challenge and defendant's Batson challenge. State v. Braxton, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 158</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 428 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1130, 121 S. Ct. 890, 148 L. Ed. 2d 797 (2001).

                            the PJs in the same manner; (3) there were no racially motivated comments made or questions asked during jury selection; and (4) the responses of the PJs provided reasonable justification for exclusion. State v. Mills,

                            Opposition to Capital Punishment on Religious Grounds. - Where the record established beyond a doubt that juror was excused, not because of his choice of religion, but because of his inability to follow the law regarding his duties as a juror, the fact
                            that the prospective juror's religion provided the basis for his views in opposition to the death penalty did not alter the propriety of excluding him for cause. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 607</cite>,

                            was sufficient support for the conclusion that potential juror removed from the jury because of her reservations about the death penalty, not because of her religious affiliation. State v. Eason,

                            Violation of Defendant's Rights Was Not Shown. - Where, although the State did not outline a profile or criteria for selecting jurors, it was obvious from the record that it would strike jurors who had connections to the defendants or to a principal State's
                            witness or whom it believed would be prejudicial against the State, the record did not reflect that the assistant district attorney made any comments indicating a purpose to discriminate, and there was no transcript of the
                            jury's voir dire and there was incomplete information on the racial composition of the jury venire and the jury, the defendants did not show that the trial judge violated defendant's rights under either the federal or State
                            constitutions by overruling their objections to the State's use of peremptory challenges. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 374 S.E.2d 604 (1988), rev'd on other grounds,

                            that the alleged deficiency of African-Americans on the jury was because of the systematic exclusion of this group in the jury-selection process, and the prosecutor provided race neutral explanations for the peremptory challenges

                            Punishment Is Within Province of Legislature. - It is within the province of the General Assembly and not the judiciary to determine the extent of punishment which may be imposed on those convicted of crime. State v. Cradle,
                            <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 499 (1972). See also, State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 168</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 410, rev'd,

                            State v. Jenkins,

                        <p>
                            This section restricts the judiciary from imposing excessive punishments where the legislature has not prescribed a fixed maximum, and does not apply to the legislative power to impose the penalty for acts made an offense by them. State v. Blake,
                            <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 608</cite>, 72 S.E. 1080 (1911).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            May Affect Legislative Enactments in Exceptional Cases. - This section is an admonition to the judiciary in imposing sentence left to an extent within its discretion by the statutes; however, there is a decided intimation that in extraordinary and exceptional
                            cases it may be held to affect legislative enactments as well. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 804</cite>, 93 S.E. 910 (1917).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Discretion of Court in Sentencing. - Within the limits of the sentence permitted by the law, the character and extent of the punishment is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and may be reviewed only in case of manifest and gross abuse.
                            State v. McKinney, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 165 S.E.2d 689 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Punishment ought to be left to the judge who inflicts it under the circumstances of each case, and ought not to be interfered with, except when the abuse is palpable. State v. Driver, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. 423</cite>                            (1878); State v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 714</cite>, 11 S.E. 315 (1890).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the question of punishment is left to the sound discretion of the court, the court is limited only by the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment in this section. State v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 209</cite>,
                            19 S.E.2d 863 (1942).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is a question of law for the court and is not subject to proof by expert opinion evidence. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 411</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 345 (1969), cert.
                            denied, 396 U.S. 1024, 90 S. Ct. 599, 24 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1970).

                        <p>
                            Test as to Reasonableness of Punishment. - There are two things which have been looked upon as very good guides in determining the reasonableness of punishment: (1) what has formerly been expressly done in like cases, and (2) for the want of such particular
                            discretion then to consider that which comes nearest to it. State v. Driver, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. 423</cite> (1878).

                            Punishment Within Limits Fixed by Statute Cannot Be Held Cruel or Unusual. - A punishment which is within the limits authorized by statute cannot be held cruel or unusual in the constitutional sense. State v. Stansbury,
                            <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 589</cite>, 55 S.E.2d 185 (1949); State v. Welch, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 77</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 199 (1950); State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 126</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 570 (1966);

                            Unless Punishment Provisions of Statute Itself are Unconstitutional. - When punishment does not exceed the limits fixed by statute it cannot be classified as cruel and unusual in a constitutional sense, unless the punishment provisions of the statute
                            itself are unconstitutional. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 411</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 345 (1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1024, 90 S. Ct. 599, 24 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1970); State v. Atkinson,

                        <p>
                            The Department of Correction has a duty to provide adequate medical care to inmates in its custody, and that duty is of such great importance that the State cannot avoid liability by contracting with someone else to perform it. Medley v. North Carolina
                            Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 837</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 654 (1992).

                        <p>
                            Consecutive Sentences. - Where there was a conviction of the violation of two separate criminal statutes, consolidated and tried as two counts under one bill of indictment, a sentence for each offense, the one to begin upon the expiration of the other
                            term, confining the punishment as to each within that prescribed in the statute relating to it, could not be considered under the facts of the case as cruel and unusual within the inhibition of this section. State v. Malpass,
                            <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 349</cite>, 127 S.E. 248 (1925).

                        <p>
                            Imposition of two life sentences to run consecutively does not contravene the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. State v. Mosteller, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 67, 164 S.E.2d 27 (1968).
                            See also, State v. Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 174</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 216 (1966).

                        <p>
                            Sentences within the statutory limits that impose consecutive sentences do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. State v. Handsome, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 313</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 670 (1980).

                            Two Year Sentence. - When no time was fixed by the statute, an imprisonment for two years would not be held cruel and unusual. State v.

        </b> - Persons' inalienable rights include the enjoyment of the fruits of the labor; it is difficult to deny that incarcerating a juvenile with no hope for release until or after the point at which society no longer
                            considers them an ordinary member of the workforce seems to run afoul of the hope for some years of life outside prison, as required by U.S. Supreme Court case law. State v. Kelliher, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).

                            Jury Instructions. - While trial court's jury instructions may have been confusing initially, the court ultimately set forth the required elements as to felonious assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury and, therefore, did not violate the
                            defendant's constitutional rights under this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Peremptory instruction on nonstatutory mitigating circumstances which required the jury to find both that the circumstances existed and that the circumstances had mitigating value did not preclude the sentencer from considering relevant mitigating evidence
                            in violation of the Constitution; the Constitution does not require that the sentencing jury "find" each circumstance which the court submits as potentially mitigating, but requires only that the sentencer be permitted to consider
                            any relevant mitigating evidence. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266,

                            Scope of Evidence in Determining Punishment Upon Plea of Guilty or Nolo Contendere. - In making a determination of what punishment should be imposed after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, a court is not confined to evidence relating to the offense
                            charged. It may look anywhere, within reasonable limits, for other facts calculated to enable it to act wisely in fixing punishment. Hence, it may inquire into such matters as the age, the character, the education, the environment,
                            the habits, the mentality, the propensities, and the record of the person about to be sentenced. In so doing, the court is not bound by the rules of evidence which obtain in a trial where guilt or innocence is put in issue
                            by a plea of not guilty. State v. McKinney, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 165 S.E.2d 689 (1969).

                            Letter to Parole Commissioner and Instructions to Prosecuting Attorney Not Part of Sentence. - Defendant's contention that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in that the trial court sentenced him to the maximum prison term permitted by statute
                            for the offense of seduction of which he was convicted, and in addition dictated a letter to the parole commissioner in which he requested that no clemency be extended defendant, and also directed the prosecuting attorney to
                            institute prosecution against defendant for failure to support his illegitimate child, was untenable, since the letter to the parole commissioner and the instructions to the prosecuting attorney were not parts of the sentence.

                            Sterilization. - The contention that sterilization amounts to cruel and unusual punishment is without basis in law, since the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Constitution refers to those persons convicted of a crime, and sterilization is not
                            a criminal proceeding within the meaning of this section. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).

                            Right Not Compromised. - Defendant was not denied his rights to confrontation, to effective assistance of counsel, to due process, to a jury trial, and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment when the trial court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial
                            based on the alleged misconduct of a juror; the juror inadvertent failure to disclose the 40-year-old information she had forgotten did not amount to concealment, and the juror demonstrated no bias. State v. Maske,

                            the trial court had the discretion not to set bail. State v. Hocutt, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 628 S.E.2d 832 (2006).

                            Jurisdiction to Consider 1973 Sentence in 2014. - Trial court had jurisdiction over a 1973 judgment to consider whether defendant's sentence was invalid under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1415ol1b8" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1415(b)(8)</a></cite>,

                            of 32 to 40 years cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const., amend. VIII or N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Juvenile Sentence of Life With Parole. - Defendant's felony murder sentence of life with the possibility of parole for a crime committed when defendant was 16 did not violate the North Carolina Constitution because, despite a slight difference in wording
                            between the Eighth Amendment and N.C. Const. art. I,

         Juvenile Sentence Unconstitutional De Facto Life Without Parole Punishment.
        </b> - As a juvenile, defendant's consecutive sentences of life and parole eligibility at 50 years constituted an unconstitutional de facto life without parole punishment; the constitution required that defendant, as
                            a juvenile who was neither incorrigible nor irredeemable, have his hope for some years of life outside prison walls restored, and the court instructed the trial court to enter two concurrent sentences of life with parole, the

                            Sentence of 12 to 20 years' imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter was within the discretionary limits fixed by statute, and while the punishment inflicted was substantial, the judgment pronounced did not come within the constitutional inhibition against

                            Possession of Housebreaking Implements. - A sentence of not less than 20 nor more than 30 years on a plea of guilty to the charge of unlawful possession of implements of housebreaking constituted cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of this
                            section. State v. Blackmon, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 352</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 880 (1963).

                            Referral of Bail Setting to Another Judicial Officer Not Wrongful Confinement. - Where the defendant was taken before a judicial officer for the setting of bail within a reasonable time, although the magistrate may have erred at that point by referring
                            the defendant's case to another judicial officer for the setting of bail rather than setting reasonable bail himself, the error did not make the defendant's temporary further confinement an unreasonable seizure or "wrongful
                            confinement" in any constitutional sense so as to necessitate suppression of his confession. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 313</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 332 (1987), cert. denied, 485
                            U.S. 963, 108 S. Ct. 1230, 99 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1988).

                            Failure to Intervene Ex Mero Motu. - Defendant's rights to due process and a fair trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,

    §§
   </span> 18, 19, 23, 24, and 27 were not violated by the trial court's failure to intervene ex mero motu in the prosecutor's closing argument, as while comparisons between criminal defendants and animals were strongly disfavored,
                            the state's use of an analogy to animals in packs helped explain the complex legal theory surrounding premeditation and deliberation. State v. Oakes, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 703 S.E.2d 476, review denied

                            Robbery. - A sentence for robbery which was within the statutory maximum did not constitute the cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by this section. State v. Witherspoon, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 714</cite>, 157 S.E.2d

                            Worthless Check. - A sentence to 18 months labor on the roads entered upon defendant's plea of guilty to a charge of drawing and uttering a worthless check was held not to be "cruel and unusual" in a constitutional sense. State v. White,
                            <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 513</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 436 (1949).

                            False Pretenses Enhanced By Habitual Offender Status. - Defendant had a lengthy criminal record and was sentenced accordingly for <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Va19s14-100" target="_blank">G.S. 14-100</a></cite>                            false pretenses, which sentence was enhanced by his status of being an habitual offender under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia2As14-7.6" target="_blank">G.S. 14-7.6</a></cite>; the sentence of
                            142 months to 180 months was within the range for a Class C level V felon, was not disproportionate to the defendant's 25-year history of criminal convictions, and was not cruel and unusual under U.S. Const., amends. VIII,
                            XIV. State v. Ledwell, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 314, 614 S.E.2d 562 (2005).

                            Fine Imposed Not Unconstitutional. - Defendant failed to show that the fine imposed was unconstitutional because the $ 1,000 fine against defendant did not constitute an abuse of discretion and was not otherwise unlawful; given the relatively modest amount
                            of the fine as compared with the seriousness of the offense, strangulation of defendant's two-year-old daughter, the fine was not grossly disproportional to the gravity of defendant's offense. State v. Zubiena,

                            Section Only Applicable to Actions Arising Out of Contract. - This section, which prohibits imprisonment for debt, is only applicable to actions arising out of or founded upon contract. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite>                            48, 203 S.E.2d 63 (1974).

                            This section has no application to actions for tort; it is confined to causes of action arising ex contractu. Long v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. 3</cite> (1883). See also, Ledford v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 447</cite>,

                            A fine or penalty imposed by a municipal ordinance is treated as a debt and, under this section of the Constitution, a person from whom it is attempted to be collected is exempt from arrest. State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 789</cite>,

                            A judgment on a note is a debt and the defendant cannot be arrested therefor. Stewart v. Bryan, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 46</cite>, 28 S.E. 18 (1897).
                            <br />

                            Any judgment rendered for nonperformance is a debt and can only be enforced by a levy on the sale of defendant's property. Defendant cannot be imprisoned therefor. Wilson v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 40</cite>,

                            Costs of Prosecution Are Not Debt. - Costs of prosecution against a prosecutor (upon acquittal of the accused or nolle prosequi entered), or against the accused upon a verdict of guilty, or a fine imposed, do not constitute a debt within the meaning of
                            this section of the Constitution, and hence the defendant may be imprisoned for nonpayment of the same. State v. Wallin, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 578</cite> (1883).

                            Imprisonment for failure to pay a sum of money is prohibited except to enforce an appropriate judicial order which has been willfully disobeyed so as to constitute contempt of court. Stanley v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 129</cite>,
                            37 S.E.2d 118 (1946).

                        <p>
                            Punishment for Contempt. - Willful failure of a husband to comply with the court's order to pay his wife an amount for support is a contempt, and can be punished as such by imprisonment, and is not within the constitutional inhibition against imprisonment
                            for debt. Wilson v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 40</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 240 (1964).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Specific Performance of Separation Agreement. - The remedy of specific performance of a separation agreement contemplating enforcement by civil contempt proceedings is not available in this State. Sainz v. Sainz, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                            744, 245 S.E.2d 372 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The enforcement of support payments provided in an extra-judicial separation agreement is accomplished as in the case of any other civil contract, i.e., through an action for breach of the contract seeking a judgment for sums due. Such an action, sounding
                            in contract, is not enforceable by execution in personam in the form of imprisonment for civil contempt for noncompliance, by reason of the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt. Sainz v. Sainz,
                            <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 744, 245 S.E.2d 372 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Plaintiff was entitled to a decree of specific performance ordering defendant to comply with a separation agreement which had not been incorporated into a judicial decree because the available remedy at law for the enforcement of such agreement was inadequate.
                            Moore v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 14</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 735 (1979).

                            Payment of Restitution Is Valid Condition for Suspension of Sentence. - Subject to the prohibition contained in this section against imprisonment for debt, except in cases of fraud, payment of restitution by a criminal defendant to the victims of his
                            crime may be a valid condition for suspension of sentence. State v. McIntyre, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 557, 235 S.E.2d 920 (1977).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Restitution Payment as Condition for Acceptance of Plea Bargain. - Payment of restitution by a criminal defendant to the victims of his crime may be a valid condition for acceptance of a plea bargain. But when restitution is ordered as result of a plea
                            bargain, it must be to a specific aggrieved party, and this party must be named in the judgment. State v. McIntyre, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 557, 235 S.E.2d 920 (1977).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Suspension of Sentence on Condition that Defendant Pay Unrelated Civil Obligation. - To suspend a sentence of imprisonment for a criminal act, however just the sentence may be per se, on condition that the defendant pay obligations unrelated to such criminal
                            act, however justly owing, is a use of the criminal process to enforce the payment of a civil obligation, and lends itself to the oppressive action which this section is designed to forbid. To sustain the suspension of sentence
                            upon such a condition would invite misuse of the practice of suspending sentence. It would substitute for the humane consideration and the objective reformation, upon which the practice ought to rest, an entirely different
                            purpose. State v. Caudle, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 550</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 778 (1970).

                            For an order of restitution to be valid it must be related to the criminal act for which defendant was convicted, or else the provision may run afoul of the constitutional provision prohibiting imprisonment for debt. State v. Froneberger,

                            The words "except in cases of fraud" comprehend not only fraud in attempting to hinder, delay and defeat the collection of a debt by concealing property and other fraudulent devices, but embrace also fraud in making the contract, such as false representations,
                            and fraud in incurring the liability; for instance, when an administrator commits a fraud by applying the funds of the estate to his own use, paying his own debts, and the like. Melvin v. Melvin,

                            No Imprisonment for Debt Absent Fraud. - This section clearly means that there shall at least be no imprisonment to enforce the payment of a debt under final process, unless it has been adjudged, upon an allegation duly made in the complaint and a corresponding
                            issue found by a jury, that there has been fraud. Ledford v. Emerson, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 527</cite>, 55 S.E. 969, 10 L.R.A. (n.s.) 362 (1906); East Coast Fertilizer Co. v. Hardee,

                            fraud, including fraud in contracting the debt or incurring the obligation. Nunn v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 374</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 497 (1967).

                        The purpose of the declaration that a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state was to insure the existence of a State militia as an alternative to a standing army. Such armies were regarded as peculiarly obnoxious in any free

                        evidence was presented indicating that the owner was dangerous or had ever misused firearms, and the owner affirmatively demonstrated that he was not among the class of citizens who posed a threat to public peace and safety; as
                        applied to the owner, G.S. 14-451.1 was an unreasonable regulation, not fairly related to the preservation of public peace and safety, and it was unreasonable to assert that a nonviolent citizen who had responsibly, safely, and
                        legally owned and used firearms for seventeen years was in reality so dangerous that any possession at all of a firearm would pose a significant threat to public safety. Britt v. State, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 546</cite>,

                        two valid warnings of his unlawful conduct, from possessing firearms in order to preserve public peace and safety. State v. Whitaker, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 689 S.E.2d 395 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 811</cite>,

                        Trial court erred in dismissing the charges against defendant on the basis that the Felony Firearms Act was unconstitutional as applied to him, as it was not unreasonable to prohibit defendant, who had two felony convictions for selling a controlled substance
                        and one for attempted assault with a deadly weapon, from possessing firearms in order to preserve public peace and safety. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 757 S.E.2d 309 (2014).

                        In a case in which defendant appealed the defendant's conviction of possession of a firearm by a felon, the appellate court concluded that the State established that defendant's "as applied" challenge to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sXIa54As14-415.1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-415.1</a></cite>                        under N.C.

                        to the preservation of public peace and safety; defendant was previously convicted of possessing a sawed-off shotgun, a weapon of mass destruction, he was unlawfully possessing at least one firearm since his conviction, he had
                        been convicted of several other crimes, and he could not claim compliance with the statute. State v. Fernandez, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 808 S.E.2d 362 (2017).

                        It is not unreasonable to prohibit a convicted felon who has subsequently violated the law on several occasions from possessing a firearm in order to preserve public peace and safety. State v. Fernandez, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite>                        539, 808 S.E.2d 362 (2017).

                        Right Is Subject to Regulation. - For case stating that the last clause of this provision constitutes an exception to the first and indicates the extent to which the right of the people to bear arms can be restricted, that is, that the legislature can
                        prohibit the carrying of concealed weapons, but no further, see State v. Kerner, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 574</cite>, 107 S.E. 222 (1921).

                    <p>
                        The right of individuals to bear arms is not absolute, but is subject to regulation. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The right to bear arms, which is protected and safeguarded by the federal and State Constitutions, is subject to the authority of the General Assembly, in the exercise of the police power, to regulate, but the regulation must be reasonable and not prohibitive,
                        and must bear a fair relation to the preservation of the public peace and safety. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).

                    <p>
                        Right to Bear Arms and Carrying of Concealed Weapons Distinguished. - This provision of the Constitution plainly observes the distinction between the "right to keep and bear arms" and "the practice of carrying concealed weapons." The first, it is declared,
                        shall not be infringed, while the latter may be prohibited. Even without this constitutional provision, the legislature may by law regulate the right to bear arms in a manner conducive to the public peace. State v. Speller,
                        <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 697</cite> (1882), approved in State v. Reams, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 556</cite>, 27 S.E. 1004 (1897).

                        of the people. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).

                        The purpose of this constitutional provision was not to prevent the community from exercising legislatively authorized powers to operate public enterprises, but to prevent the community from surrendering its power to another person or set of persons by
                        grant of exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges unless they were granted in consideration of public services; it is not retention of powers, but alienation of powers, that is prohibited. Madison Cablevision, Inc. v. City

                        the motivation is for a public purpose and in the public interest, and does not confer exclusive privilege, legislation has been upheld. Brumley v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 691</cite>, 36 S.E.2d

                        The limitation of this section, like that of N.C. Const., Art. I,
                        <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 19, does not apply to an exemption from a duty imposed upon citizens generally if the purpose of the exemption is the promotion of the general welfare, as distinguished from the benefit of the individual, and if there
                        is reasonable basis for the legislature to conclude that the granting of the exemption would be in the public interest. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967); Lamb v. Wedgewood S. Corp.,

                        This section constitutes a specific constitutional prohibition against gifts of public money, and the legislature has no power to compel or even to authorize a municipal corporation to pay a gratuity to an individual to adjust a claim which the municipality
                        is under no legal obligation to pay. Brown v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 744</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 104 (1943).

                        Statutes Which Confer Benefits on a Particular Group of Persons. - A statute which confers an exemption that benefits a particular group of persons is not an exclusive emolument or privilege within the meaning of this section, if: (1) the exemption is
                        intended to promote the general welfare rather than the benefit of the individual, and (2) there is a reasonable basis for the legislature to conclude the granting of the exemption serves the public interest. Town of Emerald Isle

                        Former employee did not adequately allege a free speech claim, an equal protection claim, and an exclusive emoluments claim when she had an adequate state remedy for those violations because the employee's claim under the Whistleblower Act,

                        Validity of G.S. 24-5. - The Legislature could reasonably have concluded that the classification scheme established by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.024.html#t24a01s24-5" target="_blank">G.S. 24-5</a></cite> would
                        best serve to further important and legitimate public purposes, including compensation of a plaintiff for the loss-of-use value of a damage award, the prevention of unjust enrichment to liability insurers who are required by law
                        to maintain claim reserves on which interest is earned, and the promotion of settlement by these insurers, who unlike self-insurers, have as their primary business the insuring, investigation, defense and settlement of claims.
                        The Legislature could have reasonably concluded that the distinction between defendants with liability insurance and those without was a valid one, and that the public welfare would be best served by such a classification. Therefore,

                        the legislature unquestionably has the power, in order to provide for the public convenience or to facilitate transportation of persons and property, to confer on a designated person the right to build a bridge, or to establish
                        a ferry, with the power to charge tolls for the use of such crossings, and, in addition, to exempt the servant who may be placed in charge from all public burdens. State v. Womble, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 862</cite>,

                        The common-law rule against perpetuities is recognized and enforced in this State. The rule is not one of construction, but a positive mandate of law, to be obeyed irrespective of the question of intention. Its primary purpose is to restrict the permissible
                        creation of future interests and prevent undue restraint upon or suspension of the right of alienation. Whenever the future interest takes effect or the right of alienation is suspended beyond the period stipulated in the rule,
                        it is violative thereof. Mercer v. Mercer, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 101</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 229 (1949); Parker v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 399</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 899 (1960).

                        Early Vesting of Estates Favored. - Where, by a correct interpretation of a will, it will reasonably be allowed, the law will favor the early vesting of estates against the interests of a contingent remainderman. Walker v. Trollinger,

                        The rule against perpetuities applies to private trusts. And when a private trust violates the rule, the court will not limit the duration of the trust, but will declare the whole trust invalid. Mercer v. Mercer, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 101</cite>,

                        rule against perpetuities, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a02s41-23" target="_blank">G.S. 41-23</a></cite> directly preserves alienability of property by prohibiting suspension of the power of alienation
                        for longer than the period provided; thus, G.S. 41-23 is a constitutional, valid exercise of the General Assembly's authority. Brown Bros. Harriman Trust Co. v. Benson, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 283, 688 S.E.2d

                        In the historical context of the passage of the North Carolina Constitution, a perpetuity was the attempt to forbid the alienation of lands under any circumstances, and to provide for their descent or disposition in a fixed, unchangeable way.

                        interests vest or terminate within a certain time period; thus, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a02s41-23" target="_blank">G.S. 41-23</a></cite>, a trust may remain valid in perpetuity as long as

                        Statute Failing to Provide for Successors to Office Did Not Create Perpetuity. - The General Assembly having failed to appoint or provide for the election of successors to the highway and sinking fund commissioners of Madison County, who were appointed
                        for a four or six-year term by Public-Local Laws of 1931, c. 341, the General Assembly would be presumed to acquiesce in their continuance in office, and the General Assembly having power to terminate, change or continue the appointments,
                        it would not be held that it intended to create perpetuities or exclusive emoluments in violation of any of the provisions of this article; said commissioners thus would continue to hold office with power to discharge the duties

        Unauthorized Practice of Law.
       </b> - State prosecutors were properly granted summary judgment in action to enjoin enforcement of North Carolina's unauthorized practice of law statutes because statutes did not unconstitutionally restrict trade association's
                        associational rights, statutes survived intermediate scrutiny and did not unlawfully burden association's freedom of speech as state had established reasonable fit between statutes and substantial government interest in regulating
                        legal profession to protect clients, statutes did not deny association due process as there was rational basis to restrict corporate ownership of professional businesses to protect consumers, statutes were not vague, and statutes
                        did not violate state constitution's Monopoly Clause. Capital Associated Indus. v. Stein, 922 F.3d 198 (4th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 666, 205 L. Ed. 2d 438, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 7540 (U.S. 2019).

                        Former G.S. 153-9(58)(a)(6) was not void as being in contravention of constitutional prohibitions against monopolies and exclusive emoluments, since the paragraph did not provide that liability insurance would be the exclusive method of indemnifying persons

                        Grant of franchise to automobile dealer is not an agreement between competitors not to compete, but a contract between a manufacturer and a dealer. The State has enacted legislation which gives automobile dealers some protection after they have made investments
                        and taken other action, relying on contracts they have made, and the State has the power to do this. American Motors Sales Corp. v. Peters, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 294 S.E.2d 764 (1982),

                        Relation to Declaratory Judgment Actions. - Although the North Carolina Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sVIIIa26s1-253" target="_blank">G.S. 1-253</a></cite> to 1-267,
                        empowers a trial court to decline a request for declaratory relief under certain circumstances, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sVIIIa26s1-257" target="_blank">G.S. 1-257</a></cite> should not be applied
                        to thwart a properly presented constitutional challenge; the North Carolina courts are obligated to protect fundamental rights when those rights are threatened and the North Carolina Constitution admonishes that a frequent recurrence
                        to fundamental principles is absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty. Therefore, where it clearly appears either that property or fundamental human rights are denied in violation of constitutional guarantees,
                        and where a statutory provision is specifically challenged by a person directly affected by it, declaratory relief as to the constitutional validity of that provision is appropriate; in other words, when the requested declaration
                        satisfies the recognized criteria, the trial court has no discretion to decline the request. Augur v. Augur, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 582</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 125 (2002).

                        North Carolina State Personnel Commission regulated employment scheme, which was meant to delineate state employees and their appointments, was constitutional because the regulations did not exhibit a situation in which the North Carolina Legislature
                        was interfering with an ordinary and simple occupation, nor was the employment scheme intended to be free from governmental regulation. Moreover, the regulations were rationally related to a substantial governmental interest, and

                            The wisdom of an enactment is a legislative and not a judicial question. The General Assembly has the right to experiment with new modes of dealing with old evils, except as prevented by the Constitution. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp.,

                            Distinction Between Delegating Power to Make Law and Conferring Authority as to Its Execution. - There is a distinction generally recognized between a delegation of the power to make a law, which necessarily includes a discretion as to what it shall be,
                            and the conferring of authority or discretion as to its execution. The first may not be done, whereas the latter, if adequate guiding standards are laid down, is permissible under certain circumstances. State v. Lisk,

                            Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the governor, state public safety agency, state highway patrol, and certain unidentified persons, and denying the wrecker service owner's motion for summary judgment on the wrecker service owner's
                            declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that regulations used to remove his wrecker service business from the state's Wrecker Rotation Services List were illegal and that the regulations were preempted by federal
                            law; the trial court had the authority to declare that the regulations were not illegal because the General Assembly granted to the state public safety agency the power to direct the state highway patrol to establish regulations
                            for private wrecker services. Ramey v. Easley, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 197, 632 S.E.2d 178 (2006).

                            Legislature Must Declare Policy, Fix Legal Principles and Provide Adequate Standards. - The legislative body must declare the policy of the law, fix legal principles which are to control in given cases, and provide adequate standards for the guidance

                            Adequate Guiding Standards Are Required. - The constitutional inhibition against delegating legislative authority does not preclude the legislature from transferring adjudicative and rule-making powers to administrative bodies provided such transfers
                            are accompanied by adequate guiding standards to govern the exercise of the delegated powers. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>,

                            Purpose of Adequate Guiding Standards Test. - The purpose of the adequate guiding standards test is to reconcile the legislative need to delegate authority with the constitutional mandate that the legislature retain in its own hands the supreme legislative
                            power. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Application of Adequate Guiding Standards Test. - The key to an intelligent application of the adequate guiding standards test is an understanding that, while delegations of power to administrative agencies are necessary, such transfers of power should
                            be closely monitored to insure that the decision-making by the agency is not arbitrary and unreasoned and that the agency is not asked to make important policy choices which might just as easily be made by the elected representatives
                            in the legislature. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                            Determining Adequacy of Standards by Existence of Procedural Safeguards. - In determining whether a particular delegation of authority is supported by adequate guiding standards, it is permissible to consider whether the authority vested in the agency
                            is subject to procedural safeguards. A key purpose of the adequate guiding standards test is to insure that the decision-making by the agency is not arbitrary and unreasoned. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic
                            Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Procedural safeguards tend to encourage adherence to legislative standards by the agency to which power has been delegated. The presence or absence of procedural safeguards is relevant to the broader question of whether a delegation of authority is accompanied
                            by adequate guiding standards. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                            Provision of Direction to Administrative Body with Expertise. - When there is an obvious need for expertise in the achievement of legislative goals, the General Assembly is not required to lay down a detailed agenda covering every conceivable problem
                            which might arise in the implementation of the legislation. It is enough if general policies and standards have been articulated which are sufficient to provide direction to an administrative body possessing the expertise to
                            adapt the legislative goals to varying circumstances. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                            Source of Standards. - In the search for adequate guiding standards, the primary sources of legislative guidance are declarations by the General Assembly of the legislative goals and policies which an agency is to apply when exercising its delegated powers.
                            Such declarations need be only as specific as the circumstances permit. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402

                            Standards for Board Regulating Trade or Profession. - When the General Assembly delegates to administrative officers and agencies its own power to prescribe detailed administrative rules and regulations governing the right of individuals to engage in
                            a trade or profession, the statute granting such authority must lay down or point to a standard for the guidance of the officer or agency in the exercise of his or its discretion. Otherwise, such statute will be deemed an unlawful
                            delegation by the General Assembly of its own authority. Guthrie v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 703</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 193 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 92 S. Ct. 1774, 32 L. Ed.

                            In licensing those who desire to engage in professions or occupations such as may be proper subjects of such regulation, the legislature may confer upon executive officers or bodies the power of granting or refusing to license persons to enter such trades
                            or professions only when it has prescribed a sufficient standard for their guidance. Revco Southeast Drug Centers, Inc. v.

                            Standards Are Unnecessary When Power Is Delegated in the Constitution. - The principle that the General Assembly may not transfer its legislative power without the establishment of standards for guidance has no application to a direct delegation by the
                            people, themselves, in the Constitution of this State, of any portion of their power, legislative or otherwise. In such case, the Supreme Court looks only to the Constitution to determine what power has been delegated. Guthrie

                            Administrative Details May Be Left to Agency. - If it were necessary for the Turnpike Authority to formulate specific plans as to the course of the turnpike through the various municipalities, and as to the manner and method of construction, and then
                            seek legislative approval thereof, there would be no purpose in creating the Authority; the legislature might just as well act itself in the entire matter. The prohibition against abdication of legislative power in favor of
                            an agency was never intended to extend to such administrative details. North Carolina Tpk. Auth. v. Pine Island, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 109</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 319 (1965).

                            Legislature May Delegate Power to Determine Facts. - The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some facts or state of facts upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action
                            depend. State v. Curtis, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 169</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 364 (1949).

                            The legislature may not abdicate its power to make laws or delegate its supreme legislative power to any other department or body. However, it is not necessary for the legislature to ascertain the facts of, or to deal with, each case. The constitutional
                            inhibition against delegating legislative authority does not deny to the legislature the necessary flexibility of enabling it to lay down policies and establish standards, while leaving to designated governmental agencies and
                            administrative boards the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the legislature shall apply. Carolina-Virginia Coastal Hwy. v. Coastal Tpk. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 52</cite>,

                            the authority to make determinations of fact upon which the application of a statute to particular situations will depend. Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>,

                            might just as easily be made by the elected representatives in the legislature, but merely to compile and administer examinations. Form, grading and logistics only are left to the Board, which does no violence to constitutional

                            Delegation of Power to Private Corporations. - The legislature may not vest in a private corporation the authority to determine in its absolute or unguided discretion the price at which another, with whom it has no contractual relation, may sell to a
                            willing buyer an article lawfully acquired and owned by him. Bulova Watch Co. v. Brand Distrib. of North Wilkesboro, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 467</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 141 (1974).

                            Delegation of Power to Rules Review Commission. - General Assembly's delegation to the Rules Review Commission of the authority to review and approve State Board of Education rules does not contravene the Board's general rulemaking authority; the General
                            Assembly has delegated review and approval authority to the Commission without violating the separation of powers clause by providing adequate guidance and limiting the Commission's review and approval power. N.C. State Bd.

                            Review and approval authority delegated to the North Carolina Rules Review Commission is an appropriate delegable power, and the General Assembly has adequately directed the Commission's review of the North Carolina State Board of Education proposed rules
                            and limited the role of the Commission to evaluating those proposed rules to ensure compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v.

                            officer or official body the duty of determining whether such conditions exist. However if the statute requires or authorizes the court or other agency to pass upon questions of public policy involved, or to exercise any discretion
                            as to whether the municipal corporation should be created, or to render any other assistance than the determination of facts, there is an attempted delegation of legislative power and the statute is invalid. Carolina-Virginia

                            Trial court's conclusion that a city council improperly circumvented an appeals process in exercising its legislative authority to amend the city's zoning map was erroneous because the enactment of zoning legislation within the limitations imposed by

                            Power to Legislate Concerning Local Problems. - The authority of the General Assembly to delegate to municipal corporations power to legislate concerning local problems, such as zoning, is an exception (established by custom in most, if not all, of the
                            states) to the general rule that legislative powers, vested in the General Assembly by this section, may not be delegated by it. This exception to the doctrine of nondelegation is not limited to a delegation of such legislative
                            authority to incorporated cities and towns, but extends, as to other types of local matters, to a like delegation to counties and other units established by the General Assembly for local government. Jackson v. Guilford County

                            The enlargement of municipal boundaries by the annexation of new territory, resulting in the extension of municipal corporate jurisdiction, is a legitimate subject of legislation. In the absence of constitutional restriction, the extent to which such
                            legislation shall be enacted, both with respect to the terms and circumstances under which the annexation may be had, and the manner in which it may be made, rests entirely in the discretion of the legislature, and an act of
                            annexation is valid which authorizes the annexation of territory without the consent of its inhabitants. Plemmer v. Matthewson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 722</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 204 (1972).

                            In delegating to town commissioners the discretionary right to decide whether to enlarge corporate limits as specified in special act, Session Laws 1971, c. 801, the General Assembly did not delegate legislative authority in violation of N.C. Const.,
                            Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 6 or this section. Except for approval by the town's board of commissioners, the act was complete in every respect at the time of its ratification. The only discretion given the commissioners was to decide whether
                            or not to annex the territory specified in the act. In authorizing the annexation, the General Assembly determined that the annexation was suitable and proper. Plemmer v. Matthewson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 722</cite>,

                            Establishment or Abolition of County Court. - While the legislature may not delegate its power to make laws, it may delegate to local political subdivisions the power to find facts determinative of whether a particular law should become effective in the
                            locality, and therefore it may delegate to county commissioners the power to establish a county court when necessary in the public interest, and, a fortiori it may also delegate to the county commissioners similar authority
                            to abolish a county court established by the legislature. Efird v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 96</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 889 (1941).

                            Issuance of Special Use Permit. - Where a municipal ordinance required the board of adjustment to issue a special use permit when it made certain affirmative findings specified in the ordinance, the board's determination of whether to issue a special
                            use permit was not an unlawful exercise of legislative power. Kenan v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 688, 187 S.E.2d 496, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 314</cite>,

                            where city council failed to make adequate findings of fact to support denial of the special use application, such action constituted an unlawful exercise of legislative power in violation of this section. Clark v. City of

                            of those engaged in the business of dry cleaning by the commission set up in the act, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, in that the act failed to set up standards or provide reasonable limitations

                        Whole County Provisions. - The People's insertion of a whole county requirement within their Constitution was not an historical accident. Rather, this provision was inserted by the People as an objective limitation upon the authority of incumbent legislators
                        to redistrict and reapportion in a manner inconsistent with the importance that North Carolinians traditionally have placed upon their respective county units in terms of their relationship to State government. Stephenson v. Bartlett,

                        Single and Multi-Member Voting Districts. - Use of both single-member and multi-member districts within the same redistricting plan violates the equal protection clause of the state Constitution unless it is established that inclusion of multi-member
                        districts advances a compelling state interest; hence the trial court would be directed on remand of action challenging 2001 legislative redistricting plans to afford the opportunity to establish, at an evidentiary hearing, that
                        the use of such districts advances a compelling state interest within the context of a specific, proposed remedial plan. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377

                        Redistricting. - Redistricting plans did not violate the Equal Protection Clause as they did not impermissibly classify individuals based upon their race because, as to the 26 districts drawn to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, although
                        the three-judge panel erred when it applied strict scrutiny prematurely, there was a compelling state interest in creating districts that would avoid liability under sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act; and because, as to
                        the remaining challenged districts, the predominant factors in their creation were the traditional and permissible redistricting principles encompassed within the mandatory framework as established by precedents of the United States
                        Supreme Court and the North Carolina Supreme Court. Dickson v. Rucho, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 481</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 404 (2015).

                        according to where a citizen happens to reside. Representation in state legislative bodies must be, as nearly as practicable, apportioned on districts of equal population, though mechanical exactness is not required. Political
                        subdivisions may be recognized, but not at the cost of substantial equality among the several districts. Considerations of history, economic or other group interests or area alone do not justify substantial deviations from the
                        equal population concept. Nor will the presence of large numbers of military and military related personnel justify the underrepresentation of an area. Discrimination against a class of individuals, merely because of the nature
                        of their employment, without more being shown, is constitutionally impermissible. Drum v. Seawell, 249 F. Supp. 877 (M.D.N.C. 1965), aff'd, 383 U.S. 831, 86 S. Ct. 1237, 16 L. Ed. 2d 298 (1966), decided under Art. II,

                        Whole County Provisions. - The People's insertion of a whole county requirement within their Constitution was not an historical accident. Rather, this provision was inserted by the People as an objective limitation upon the authority of incumbent legislators
                        to redistrict and reapportion in a manner inconsistent with the importance that North Carolinians traditionally have placed upon their respective county units in terms of their relationship to State government. Stephenson v. Bartlett,
                        <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).

    §§
   </span> 3(3) and 5(3) are interpreted consistent with federal law and reconciled with equal protection requirements under the state Constitution by requiring the formation of single-member districts in North Carolina legislative
                        redistricting plans. The boundaries of such single-member districts, however, may not cross county lines except as outlined in the court's opinion. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377

                    <p>
                        Single and Multi-Member Voting Districts. - Use of both single-member and multi-member districts within the same redistricting plan violates the equal protection clause of the state Constitution unless it is established that inclusion of multi-member
                        districts advances a compelling state interest; hence the trial court would be directed on remand of action challenging 2001 legislative redistricting plans to afford the opportunity to establish, at an evidentiary hearing, that
                        the use of such districts advances a compelling state interest within the context of a specific, proposed remedial plan. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377
                        (2002).

                        While instructive as to how multi-member districts may be used compatibly with "one-person, one-vote" principles, N.C. Const., Art. II,
                        <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span> 3(3) and 5(3) are not affirmative constitutional mandates and do not authorize use of both single-member and multi-member districts in a manner violative of the fundamental right of each North Carolinian to substantially
                        equal voting power. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Redistricting. - Redistricting plans did not violate the Equal Protection Clause as they did not impermissibly classify individuals based upon their race because, as to the 26 districts drawn to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, although
                        the three-judge panel erred when it applied strict scrutiny prematurely, there was a compelling state interest in creating districts that would avoid liability under sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act; and because, as to
                        the remaining challenged districts, the predominant factors in their creation were the traditional and permissible redistricting principles encompassed within the mandatory framework as established by precedents of the United States
                        Supreme Court and the North Carolina Supreme Court. Dickson v. Rucho, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 481</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 404 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a racial gerrymandering case, the federal district court clearly erred in overriding the North Carolina General Assembly's redrawing of districts in two counties where no constitutional violation had been found; the district court did not have the
                        authority to disregard the legislature's remedial map based on a finding that the revision violated the North Carolina Constitution's ban on mid-decade redistricting. North Carolina v. Covington, - U.S. - , 138 S. Ct. 2548, 201
                        L. Ed. 2d 993 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Prohibition on mid-decade redistricting was violated by mid-decade remedial redistricting plans, to the extent changes were not necessary to remedy violations of the Equal Protection Clause. Covington v. North Carolina, - F. Supp. 2d - (M.D.N.C. Jan.

                    <p>
                        2001 Legislative Redistricting Plans. - Because the General Assembly enacted its 2001 legislative redistricting plans (Session Laws 2001-458 and 2001-459) in violation of the whole county provisions of N.C. Const., Art. II,
                        <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span> 3(3) and 5(3), these plans are unconstitutional and are therefore void. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).

                        Placement of Enacting Clause. - Article II, Section 21 of the State Constitution does not require the enacting clause "The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:" to be included in the actual law as codified; rather, the enacting clause is generally
                        included in the preamble to an act. Hence, where the Session Laws to each of the sections of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html" target="_blank">Chapter 20</a></cite> under which defendant
                        was prosecuted contained the proper enacting clause language required by the Constitution, defendant's allegation that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his case was without merit.

                            search for a meaning elsewhere. The language of this section is clear in that it applies to statutes enacted to impose a tax. North Carolina E. Mun. Power v.

Sess., 1988) imposed a greater tax burden on plaintiff for 1988. However, this section focuses on the purpose of the statute (to impose a tax) and not the result of the statute (an increased tax burden).
                            Chapter 1052 of Session Laws 1987 (Reg. Sess., 1988) neither imposes a tax nor authorizes its imposition, and therefore, this section does not apply. North Carolina E.

Wake County, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite>                            693, 398 S.E.2d 486 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 270</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 838 (1991).

                            Tolls and Taxes Distinguished. - Taxes are levied for the support of government, and their amount is regulated by its necessities. Tolls are compensation for the use of another's property or for improvements which have been made, and their amount is determined
                            by the cost of the property or improvements. North Carolina Tpk. Auth. v. Pine Island, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 109</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 319 (1965).

         What Journals Must Show.
        </b> - The journal must show who voted for the bill, and that the requisite number of Senators and members did so, and no other source of evidence can be invoked; the certificate of the presiding officers that a bill
                            has been read three times does not obviate the necessity of examining the journal. Burlingham v. City of New Bern, 213 F. 1014 (E.D.N.C. 1914).

                        <p>
                            Showing of Nays. - As this section requires that on the voting of a bill before the legislature the yeas and nays shall be entered on the journals, either the nays must be on the journal, or it must affirmatively appear that there were none. Commissioners
                            of New Hanover County v. DeRosset, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 275</cite>, 40 S.E. 43 (1901).

                            Where the House journal showed that a certain law, authorizing the issuance of county bonds, was passed by the following vote: "Ayes 94, nays . . .; total . . .", such record sufficiently showed that there was no negative vote cast, under the presumption
                            that the Clerk of the House charged with the recording of the vote performed his duty, and hence such record constituted a sufficient compliance with this section. Board of Comm'rs v. Tollman, 145 F. 753 (4th Cir. 1906).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A bill to authorize a county to pledge its faith and credit by issuing bonds for road purposes, duly ratified, was not invalid for failure to meet the requirements of this section, by reason of the failure to record on the journal on the second reading
                            in one of the branches of the legislature the "no" vote, when it was made to appear from the entries of the names of those voting in the affirmative that a majority of the voters had so voted, the absence of the entries of
                            the names of those voting in the negative showing that there were none. Leonard v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 527</cite>, 117 S.E. 580 (1923), citing Board of Comm'rs v. Trust

                            Journals Conclusive. - The journals are conclusive as against not only a printed statute published by authority of law, but also against a duly enrolled act. Union Bank v. Commissioners of Oxford, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 214</cite>,
                            25 S.E. 966 (1896); Commissioners of Stanly County v. Snuggs, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 394</cite>, 28 S.E. 539 (1897).

                            The journals are the sole evidence as to whether the ayes and noes on a vote on a bill were entered on such journals. Commissioners of New Hanover County v. De Rosset, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 275</cite>, 40 S.E. 43 (1901);

                            The journals of the General Assembly, when competent as evidence, import absolute verity, and cannot be explained or altered by parol evidence. Wilson v. Markley, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 616</cite>, 45 S.E. 1023 (1903).

                            The Constitution requires that it should appear, not from the entries on the original bill, but from the journal, that the bill was properly read and the necessary entry of yeas and nays was made. If the journal should show that the bill was properly
                            passed, no evidence will be received to contradict what is therein recorded. State ex rel. Dyer v. City of Leaksville, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 41</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 201 (1969).

                        <p>
                            Certificates of Ratification Not Proof. - With respect to the requirements in this section, the House and Senate journals, and not the certificates of ratification signed by the presiding officers, are the sources of proof as to whether the bill was read
                            on three several days in each house of the General Assembly and passed three several readings on three different days and that the yeas and nays on the second and third readings were entered on the journals. State ex rel. Dyer

                            Effect of Certificates of Ratification. - The usual certificate of ratification is conclusive only of the fact of ratification, but not of a compliance with this section of the Constitution. Smathers v. Commissioners of Madison County,
                            <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 480</cite>, 34 S.E. 554 (1899).

                            The certificate of the speakers of each house of the legislature is conclusive evidence that a bill was read and passed three several readings in each house. Commissioners of New Hanover County v. DeRossett, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 275</cite>,
                            40 S.E. 43 (1901).

                        <p>
                            Correction of Journals. - A subsequent special session of the same legislature may correct its journals of the regular session so as to show in point of fact that a bill of this character was properly passed in accordance with these provisions. Commissioners
                            of Richmond County v. Farmers Bank, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 387</cite>, 67 S.E. 969 (1910).

                            Where journal of the Senate affirmatively showed that first and second readings took place on the same day, the act was unconstitutional. Storm v. Town of Wrightsville Beach, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 679</cite>, 128 S.E.

                            When Amendment Will Affect Constitutionality. - An act passed in accordance with this section is not rendered invalid by an amendment not passed in accordance with the constitutional provision when the amendment does not affect the taxing or other financial
                            features of the act, increase either the taxes, or impose any additional burden on the taxpayer. Wagstaff v. Central Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 377</cite>, 93 S.E. 908 (1917).

                        <p>
                            Passage of Material Amendments. - A material amendment made by one branch of the legislature to a bill passed by the other, allowing a county to pledge its credit in issuing bonds for the improvement of the highways therein, must be concurred in according
                            to the requirements of this section. Glenn v. Wray, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 730</cite>, 36 S.E. 167 (1900); Claywell v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 657</cite>, 92 S.E.

                        <p>
                            Passage of Immaterial Amendments. - When an act has been passed in accordance with this section, an amendment which does not increase the amount of the bonds or the taxes to be levied or otherwise materially change the original bill may be adopted by
                            the concurrence of both houses of the General Assembly. Board of Comm'rs v. F.M. Stafford &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 453</cite>, 50 S.E. 862 (1905).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An amendment which does not increase the amount of the bonds or tax to be levied, or otherwise materially change the bill is immaterial. Gregg v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. 479</cite>, 78 S.E. 301 (1913).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            It is only when a material amendment is affected that rereading is necessary. Frazier v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 49</cite>, 138 S.E. 433 (1927).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            No Presumption of Materiality of Amendment. - Where the journal does not show the effect of the amendment, there is no presumption that it was material. Frazier v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 49</cite>,
                            138 S.E. 433 (1927).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evidence of Materiality. - Slips of paper attached by a rubber band to the cover of the original bill when it was engrossed were not admissible in determining whether an amendment was material. Frazier v. Board of Comm'rs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 49</cite>, 138 S.E. 433 (1927).

                        <p>
                            Materiality a Judicial Question. - Whether an amendment is material and required to be passed in accordance with this section is a question of law for the court, under the facts, and is not controlled by an agreement between the parties. Wagstaff v. Central
                            Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 377</cite>, 93 S.E. 908 (1917).

                        <p>
                            Validation by Later Act. - Where a statute, pledging the faith and credit of the State in issuing State bonds, has not been passed in accordance with the provisions of this section and is therefore invalid, its invalidity may be cured by a later statute
                            passed as the Constitution requires, referring to the former statute, and supplying the omissions, and the bonds thereunder issued after the question has been submitted to and approved by the voters of the State, as the statute
                            required, are valid. Hinton v. Lacy, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 496</cite>, 137 S.E. 669 (1927).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Change in Caption. - A slightly different caption retaining the number of the original bill was an immaterial amendment. Brown v. Road Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 598</cite>, 92 S.E. 502 (1917).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Substitution of Name of Commissioner. - An amendment in the second branch of the legislature substituting the name of a commissioner does not broaden the scope of the act or affect its financial feature, and the failure in the first branch to comply with
                            this section will not alone affect its validity. Brown v. Road Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 598</cite>, 92 S.E. 502 (1917).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Curtailing Territory to Which Indebtedness Applied. - An act empowering special school districts of the State to issue bonds, which followed the requirements of this section except that upon its last reading, by amendment, it was made to apply only to
                            one district in the State, the effect of the amendment being to exclude the other districts, and the act being regularly enacted as to the one district retained, was valid as to that district. Gregg v. Board of Comm'rs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. 479</cite>, 78 S.E. 301 (1913).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where a bill was introduced in one branch of the legislature for the issuance of bonds, and amendments were made by the other branch, withdrawing certain of the more wealthy and popular townships from the liability for the indebtedness to be created,
                            except under condition requiring the approval of the voters, the amendment was a material one, requiring for the validity of the act that it be passed in accordance with the requirements of this section. Claywell v. Board of
                            Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 657</cite>, 92 S.E. 481 (1917).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Substitution of Tax Bill. - Where a bill authorizing a levy of taxes for road purposes was read and referred to a committee, and the committee recommended a substitute, resulting in the tabling of the original bill and the passing of the substitute on
                            two separate days in that branch of the legislature, and otherwise conforming to the requirements of this section, in both branches, the substitute would be regarded, in the contemplation of the Constitution, as an amendment
                            to the original bill introduced, and the act could not successfully be questioned as not having passed on the several separate days required of a bill of this character. Edwards v. Nash County Bd. of Comm'rs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 58</cite>, 110 S.E. 600 (1922).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Increase in Tax Rate. - When an act was passed by the legislature authorizing a graded school district to vote on the question of issuing school bonds in a certain amount, and amended at a subsequent session so as to authorize bonds to a larger amount
                            and to run a longer time, both acts having been passed upon their several readings, with aye and no vote according to this section, an issue of bonds under a still later and similar act for a larger amount and upon a greater
                            rate of taxation was invalid in toto when the later act was not likewise passed in accordance with this section. Russell v. Town of Troy, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. 366</cite>, 74 S.E. 1021 (1912).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Increase in Interest Rate on Bonds. - An amendment to an act authorizing a county to issue bonds for road construction, which increases the rate of interest from 5% to 6%, involved material change in the former law. Guire v. Board of Comm'rs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 516</cite>, 99 S.E. 430 (1919).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where a municipal charter authorizing issuance of bonds was subsequently amended with regard thereto, but upon condition that the proposition be submitted to the voters, which was never done, and the legislature attempted to pass a still later law amending
                            the former act but not in accordance with the requirements of this section, the later acts were of no effect, leaving the charter of the town as to these provisions open, under the terms of which the bonds could yet be issued.
                            Cottrell v. Town of Lenoir, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 138</cite>, 91 S.E. 827 (1917).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subsequent Act Requiring Referendum on Bond Issue. - Where the legislature passed an act authorizing a county to pledge its faith and credit in the issuance of bonds upon its several readings, upon its aye and no vote in accordance with this section,
                            and by later ratification of an act requires the question to be submitted to the qualified voters, it was not necessary that the later ratified act also be passed in accordance with the constitutional requirement, and thus,
                            in the absence of a proper election, the bond issue would be declared invalid. Graham County v. W.K. Terry &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 22</cite>, 138 S.E. 443 (1927).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the legislature passed an act authorizing a county to issue bonds according to the provisions of this section, it was within its power to add a provision that the question be first submitted to the electorate of the county. Graham County v. W.K.
                            Terry &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 22</cite>, 138 S.E. 443 (1927).

                        <p>
                            An amendment which made a material change in the valid act it proposed to amend was unconstitutional, and the commissioners were without authority to levy the tax specified in the later act. Township Rd. Comm'n v. Board of Comm'rs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 61</cite>, 100 S.E. 122 (1919).

                            Purpose of Section. - This section is remedial in its nature and was intended not only to free the legislature of petty detail but also to require uniform and coordinated action under general laws in regard to the matters therein stipulated which are
                            related to the welfare of the people of the whole State; and the application of the section should not be denied on any unsubstantial distinction which would defeat its purpose. Board of Health v. Board of Comm'rs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 140</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 677 (1941).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In adopting this section, the people were motivated by the desire that the General Assembly should legislate for North Carolina in respect to the subjects specified as a single united commonwealth rather than as a conglomeration of innumerable discordant
                            communities. To prevent this laudable desire from degenerating into a mere pious hope, they decreed in emphatic and express terms that any local, private, or special act or resolution passed in violation of the provisions of
                            this section shall be void, no matter how praiseworthy or wise such local, private, or special act or resolution may be. Idol v. Street, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 730</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 313 (1951).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was the purpose of this section to free the General Assembly from the enormous amount of petty detail which had been occupying its attention, to enable it to devote more time and attention to general legislation of statewide interest and concern, to
                            strengthen local self-government by providing for the delegation of local matters by general laws to local authorities, and to require uniform and coordinated action under general laws on matters related to the welfare of the
                            whole State. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of this section was to relieve the General Assembly from the necessity of passing on laws relating to certain specified matters in which only a small territory or a few persons were concerned, and to thereby enable members of the General Assembly
                            to devote their time and attention to the enactment of legislation important to the entire State. Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967);
                            Town of Emerald Isle ex rel. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 640</cite>, 360 S.E.2d 756 (1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was the purpose of this section to free the General Assembly from the enormous amount of petty detail which had been occupying its attention, to enable it to devote more time and attention to general legislation of statewide interest and concern, to
                            strengthen local self-government by providing for the delegation of local matters by general laws to local authorities, and to require uniform and coordinated action under general laws on matters related to the welfare of the
                            whole State of North Carolina. Williams v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 170</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 415 (2003).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Effect of Section. - The modification wrought by this section is that now a local, private or special act, dealing with designated subjects, is void as violative of this section. State v. Chestnutt, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 401</cite>,
                            85 S.E.2d 297 (1955).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The constitutional prohibition against local acts simply commands that when legislating in certain specified fields, the General Assembly must make rational distinctions among units of local government which are reasonably related to the purpose of the
                            legislation. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although North Carolina is not a home rule jurisdiction, and although the North Carolina Constitution, consistent with the language of N.C. Const. art. VII,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 1, gives the General Assembly exceedingly broad authority over the "powers and duties" delegated to local governments, that authority is subject to limitations imposed by other constitutional provisions, including
                            the limitations set out in N.C. Const. art. II,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 24, barring local laws on certain prohibited subjects, which is the fundamental law of North Carolina and may not be ignored. City of Asheville v. State, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 80</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 759 (2016).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An act is not invalid merely because it is local unless it violates some constitutional provision. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This section does not forbid local acts passed in the exercise of delegated police power if they do not relate to the matters therein prohibited. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Constitutionality of Statutes Supplementing General Laws. - Statutes which do not directly contravene this section, but supplement general laws and policy, or aid in administering or financing policy established by general law, are not unconstitutional,
                            especially when the administrative unit is local in nature. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prospective Effect of Statute's Unconstitutionality. - Where defendants reasonably relied on invalid statute and acted in good faith in carrying out the mandate of the General Assembly, the trial court did not err by directing the effect of the statute's

                            Reasonable Classification Test. - When an employer claimed that a county ordinance regulating employment discrimination and the enabling legislation allowing its enactment were invalid local acts which regulated labor and trade, the appropriate test to
                            apply in determining whether the legislation in question was general or local was the reasonable classification test. Williams v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 170</cite>,

                            Statutes relating to persons or things as a class are general laws. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).

                            A law is general if it applies to and operates uniformly on all the members of any class of persons, places, or things requiring legislation peculiar to itself in matters covered by the law. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants,

                            Classifications Within General Laws. - Classifications must be general within the limits of the subject matter. They must be reasonable, and the statute must affect all within the class uniformly. Classifications must not be arbitrary or capricious, but
                            must be natural and intrinsic and based on substantial differences. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).

                            While substantial distinctions are essential in classification, the distinctions need not be scientific or exact. The legislature has wide discretion in making classifications. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources,
                            <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                            Universality is immaterial so long as those affected are reasonably different from those excluded and, for the purpose of the statute, there is a logical basis for treating them in a different manner. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants,
                            <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965).

                            There is no constitutional requirement that a regulation must reach every class to which it might be applied - that the legislature must be held rigidly to the choice of regulating all or none. It is enough that the present statute strikes at the evil
                            where it is felt, and reaches the class of cases where it most frequently occurs. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249

                            When the persons or things subject to the law are not reasonably different from those excluded, the statute is local or special. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).

                            The phrase "local law" means, primarily at least, a law that in fact, if not in form, is confined within territorial limits other than that of the whole State, or applies to any political subdivision or subdivisions of the State less than the whole, or
                            to the property and persons of a limited portion of the State, or to a comparatively small portion of the State, or is directed to a specific locality or spot, as distinguished from a law which operates generally throughout
                            the State. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).

                        <p>
                            A law is local where, by force of an inherent limitation, it arbitrarily separates some places from others upon which, but for such limitation, it would operate, and where it embraces less than the entire class of places to which such legislation would
                            be necessary or appropriate, having regard to the purpose for which the legislation was designed, and where classification does not rest on circumstances distinguishing the places included from those excluded. High Point Surplus

                            A local act is an act applying to fewer than all counties, in which the affected counties do not rationally differ from the excepted counties in relation to the purpose of the act. Smith v. County of Mecklenburg, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 497</cite>,

                            A local act is one which unreasonably singles out a class for special legislative attention, or which, having made a reasonable classification, does not apply uniformly to all members of the designated class. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp;
                            Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                            Determining Nature of Act. - Determination of whether a statute is a local one prohibited by this section should be largely left to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, giving significance to the rule that legislative acts are presumed
                            to have been rightfully passed from proper motives, and that a classification of this kind, when made by them, should not be disturbed unless it is manifestly arbitrary and invalid. In re Harris,
                            <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 633</cite>, 112 S.E. 425 (1922).

                        <p>
                            In determining whether an enactment is a general law, legislative intent must be found from the language of the act, its legislative history, and the circumstances surrounding its adoption which throw light upon the evil sought to be remedied and the
                            actual purpose to be accomplished. In re Indian Hills, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 659</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 909 (1972).

                            Courts Look Beyond Form of Statutes. - In determining whether a statute relating to matters enumerated in this section is a "local, private, or special" act inhibited by this section or a "general law" which the General Assembly has the power to pass,
                            the courts will look beyond the form of the act and ascertain whether the statute, in fact, is generally and usually applicable throughout the area comprising the State. State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 161</cite>,
                            1 S.E.2d 521 (1939); In re Indian Hills, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 659</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 909 (1972).

                        <p>
                            The mere fact that a statute applies only to certain units of local government does not by itself render the statute a prohibited local act. Only if the statutory classification is unreasonable or under-inclusive will the statute be voided as a prohibited
                            local act. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                        <p>
                            The number of counties included or excluded is not necessarily determinative. Conceivably, a statute may be local if it excludes only one county. On the other hand, it may be general if it includes only one or a few counties. It is a matter of classification.

                            does not apply to annexation proceedings by municipalities, since N.C. Const., Art. VII,

                            Streets Within City Limits. - The unlimited power in the General Assembly to provide for the creation and extension of corporate limits of municipal corporations would seem to include the right to vest in such municipal corporations the authority to levy
                            taxes to lay out and maintain highways and streets within such limits, since they are essential to the existence of such corporations, and such private act would not seem to contravene this section. Matthews v. Town of Blowing

                            unquestionably an act purporting to authorize the laying out of particular streets or highways, or to authorize the maintenance of a designated street or streets, or the discontinuance thereof, would be repugnant to this section.

                            date of this section, a subsequent local law which merely increased the jurisdiction and authority granted to the city in regard to such improvements did not violate the constitutional proscription. City of Goldsboro v. Atlantic

                            when it is confined to the control and management of the funds, and leaves to the local authorities the power given them by this section over "the laying out, opening, or discontinuance of highways." Board of Comm'rs v. Pruden

                            Private Act Closing Certain Public Roads. - Where part of the land in a private development was added to the playground of a public school, and the General Assembly, by private act (Private Laws of 1933, c. 72), declared that certain roads dedicated in
                            the registered plot of the development were no longer needed and that the roads should be closed and added to the playground space for the school, this act was void as being a private or special act inhibited by this section.

                            Local Laws Establishing or Changing Lines of School Districts Prohibited. - Since the enforcement of this section, special acts of the legislature to establish or change the lines, etc., of a school district, and any proceedings under it, are null and
                            void. Galloway v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 245</cite>, 114 S.E. 165 (1922).

                        <p>
                            Meaning of "School District". - A "school district" is an area within a county in which one or more public schools must be maintained. Hobbs v. County of Moore, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 665</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 1 (1966).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            An "administrative unit" is not a "school district" within the meaning of this section. Hobbs v. County of Moore, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 665</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 1 (1966).

                            A statute which creates a public school district and allows a bond issue, upon the approval of voters, for its equipment and maintenance, is a local or special act, prohibited by this section. Robinson v. Board of Comm'rs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 590</cite>, 109 S.E. 855 (1921).

                            A statute which lays off or defines by boundary a certain territory as a graded school district within a county, and provides for an issue of bonds upon the approval of the voters therein, for the necessary buildings and maintenance, comes within the
                            provision of this section. Board of Trustees v. Mutual Loan &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 306</cite>, 107 S.E. 130 (1921).

                        <p>
                            Bonds and Taxes Authorized in Void Act. - Where an act to create a public school district is unconstitutional, because it violates this section, the provision for bonds and taxation to carry out the purpose of the act is likewise void. Sechrist v. Board
                            of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 511</cite>, 107 S.E. 503 (1921).

                            An act for the purpose of ratifying a county ordinance providing for the issuance of bonds and levy of taxes for school purposes in a district established without authority is a local, private or special act prohibited by this section, and the issuance
                            of such bonds and levy of such taxes will be permanently enjoined. Woosley v. Commissioners of Davidson County, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 429</cite>, 109 S.E. 368 (1921).

                            Allowing Existing School District to Submit Question of Bonds and Taxation to Voters. - A statute allowing an existing consolidated school district to submit the question of taxation and the issue of bonds for school purposes to the district is not prohibited
                            by this section. Burney v. Commissioners of Bladen County, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 274</cite>, 114 S.E. 298 (1922).

                        <p>
                            Incorporation of Existing School Districts. - Incorporating existing local school districts for all purposes relating to the issuance or payment of bonds upon the approval of the voters of a district is valid and is not in contravention of this section.

                            Setting Up Machinery Under Which County May Establish School Districts. - This section prohibits the legislature from passing any special, private or local act which ex proprio vigore undertakes to establish or change the boundaries of a school district,
                            but this section does not proscribe the legislature from setting up machinery under which a county, as the administrative unit charged with making provisions for necessary capital outlay, may create school districts or special
                            bond tax units within the county to accomplish this purpose. Therefore, Public-Local Laws of 1937, c. 279, which provided the machinery under which the county of Buncombe could establish school districts or special bond tax
                            units in the county, was not in contravention of this section. Fletcher v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 1</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 606 (1940); Hinson v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 1</cite>3,

                            Enabling Consolidation of County and City School Administrative Units Under General Laws. - A statute enabling the consolidation of county and city school administrative units under the general laws and the levy of certain taxes for the construction and
                            operation of the schools of the consolidated unit does not violate this section, since it does not, in itself, undertake to establish or change the lines of a school district, but merely provides machinery for action by local
                            units under the general law, and further provisions of the statute requiring that the merger and the levy of the taxes be approved by a vote does not alter this result. Peacock v. County of Scotland,
                            <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 199</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 612 (1964).

                            Extending Limits of City or Town in which Schools May Be Maintained. - While the boundaries of a "district" may be coterminous with those of a city or town, it does not follow that an act extending the limits of a city or town in which public schools
                            may be maintained is necessarily a special act establishing or changing the lines of school districts in violation of the Constitution. Hailey v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 17</cite>,
                            144 S.E. 377 (1928).

                        <p>
                            Recognizing School District in Changed City Limits. - A public-local act that enlarged the city limits and recognized therein the independent existence of a public school district within the former limits was not contrary to the provisions of this section,
                            as an attempt to establish a school district, or to change the limits of those already established. Duffy v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 470</cite>, 120 S.E. 53 (1923).

                            Meaning of "Trade". - A "trade" within the meaning of this section includes any employment or business embarked in for gain or profit. State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 161</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 521 (1939); Orange Speedway,

                            It was not contemplated under this section that the State would enter any trade or business venture for profit. Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967).

                            employment discrimination ordinance as the county only possessed those powers validly delegated to it by the state, and the state's attempted delegation of this power to the county violated N.C. Const., Art. II,

                            When the legislature passed legislation enabling a particular county to adopt an ordinance prohibiting employment discrimination, it violated subdivision (1)(j) of this section because there was no rational basis to treat this county differently from
                            any other county as to this subject, nor was there evidence that the employment practices in this county were different from those in any other county in the state, and the legislation enabled the county to regulate labor and
                            trade. Williams v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 170</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 415 (2003).

                            Option Election Covering ABC Stores. - Session Laws 1965, c. 650, authorizing a local option election in Reidsville to determine whether alcoholic beverage control stores may be operated in that city and providing for the establishment of a city board
                            of alcoholic control if authority is granted, does not violate this section as the act of dispensing intoxicating liquor by the State is not a trade, but is a valid exercise of its police powers. Gardner v. City of Reidsville,

                            billiard parlors, dance halls, and clubs, was a local act regulating trade and, therefore, unconstitutional under this section. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d

                            Sunday Sale Laws as Regulation of Trade. - A statute proscribing the sale on Sunday of merchandise falling within certain classifications is a statute regulating trade under the purview of this section. Treasure City of Fayetteville, Inc. v. Clark,
                            <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 130</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 97 (1964).

                            An act which restricts or regulates the operation, engaging in or carrying on of business, or prohibits the sale of merchandise, on Sunday, regulates trade. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Sunday-Observance Ordinances. - When a county or a city attempts to pass, under a local grant of police power, a Sunday-observance ordinance whose only effect is to regulate trade, the legislation must yield to this section, whether the purported authority
                            to pass it is specifically conferred in the act or not. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When enacted by cities and towns under general laws, Sunday-observance ordinances which are reasonable and do not discriminate within a class of competitors similarly situate have been upheld as a valid exercise of delegated police power. All such ordinances,
                            when they proscribe buying and selling, whether it be, say, tangible merchandise or a ticket to an amusement or a sporting event, regulate trade under the broad definition of trade which has been adopted by the Supreme Court.
                            Since, however, these city ordinances are passed under general laws, with reference to them there is no conflict between the exercise of the police power and this section. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>,
                            143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If an ordinance prohibits all of a certain type of activity on Sunday, as, e.g., motor vehicle racing, which might or might not be commercial, its exercise of police power does not conflict with this section, for its regulation of trade is merely incidental
                            or consequential. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Prohibition of Motor Vehicle Races on Sunday. - Session Laws of 1949, c. 177, which bans all motor vehicle races on Sunday in Wake County without regard to the commercial or noncommercial character of the activity, is not an act regulating labor or trade
                            within the meaning of this section. Persons whose activities are commercial in character are in no better position than those who engage in the proscribed activity without reference to profit. State v. Chestnutt,
                            <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 401</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 297 (1955).

                            A statute which purported to authorize only 52 of the 100 counties to regulate and prohibit the sale of goods, wares, and merchandise on Sunday, was a local act regulating trade and thus a violation of this section. State v. Smith,
                            <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).

                            The 1963 amendment to G.S. 14-346.2, proscribing the sale on Sunday of merchandise of specific classifications within the State, but exempting designated counties and parts of counties therefrom, with provision that the areas exempted are exempted upon
                            the classification of such areas as resort or tourist areas, but which does not define "resort area" and which as a matter of common knowledge does not exempt all recognized tourist areas of the State or, by its classifications
                            of goods, preclude the sale only of such merchandise as is inappropriate to the tourist trade, is held void as a local law in violation of this section. Treasure City of Fayetteville, Inc. v. Clark,

         Statutory provisions that waived or modified the state competitive bid requirements for certain construction projects

                            was despite the fact that the statutes applied to only one board of education and were, therefore, local in nature, because the clear intent of the legislation was to regulate the bid process, rather than trade, and the law

                        Execution of the Laws. - When executive officers appointed by the General Assembly form a majority on a commission that has the final say on how to execute the laws the General Assembly, not the Governor, can exert most of the control over the executive
                        policy that is implemented; the Governor cannot take care that the laws are faithfully executed, and the separation of powers clause does not allow the General Assembly to take this much control over the execution of the laws from
                        the Governor and lodge it with itself. State ex rel. McCrory v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 633</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 248 (2016).

                        Duty of Governor to Execute Laws. - The Governor, as the constituted head of the executive department, is charged with the duty of seeing that legislative acts are carried into effect. Winslow v. Morton, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 486</cite>,
                        24 S.E. 417 (1896).

                        Construction. - Because the North Carolina Public Records Law was enacted pursuant to the state's general policy that the people may obtain copies of their public records and public information free or at minimal cost unless otherwise specifically provided
                        by law, and nothing in the Public Records Law refers to or specifically pertains to either pardons or clemency, it is not a law relative to the manner of applying for pardons under N.C. Const., Art. III,

        Budget Process.
       </b> - The Constitution mandates a three-step process with respect to the State's budget: (1) this section directs that the "Governor shall prepare and recommend to the General Assembly a comprehensive budget . . . for the
                        ensuing fiscal period"; (2) N.C. Const., Art. II, vests in the General Assembly the power to enact a budget (one recommended by the Governor or one of its own making); and (3) after the General Assembly enacts a budget, this section
                        then provides that the Governor shall administer the budget "as enacted by the General Assembly." In re Powers, 295 S.E.2d 589 (N.C. 1982).

                    <p>
                        Appropriation of Federal Block Grant Funds. - Governor's claim challenging the General Assembly's appropriation of federal block grant funds awarded to the State was properly dismissed as the block grant funds were, despite their source in the federal
                        government, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly because Congress left the issue of state legislative appropriation of federal block grants for each state to determine; and, while some federal funds could be considered
                        custodial agency funds, the State Budget Act treated federal block grants as state funds subject to appropriation through the statutory budgetary process, and the Governor did not identify any federal prohibition against treating
                        the block grant funds as state funds subject to legislative appropriation. Cooper v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 837 S.E.2d 7 (2019).

                        Pardons Exclusive Prerogative of Governor. - After a defendant has begun the service of his term, or at least when that takes place after the adjournment of the court, it is beyond the jurisdiction of the judge to alter the sentence or interfere with
                        it in any way, as the power of pardon, parole or discharge during the term of imprisonment is by this section the exclusive prerogative of the Governor. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 249</cite>,
                        37 S.E.2d 691 (1946), decided before the 1954 amendment to Art. III,

                    <p>
                        Power of General Assembly to Pass Amnesty Act. - The power, granted by this section, to exercise clemency after conviction in some particular case and in favor of an individual especially charged with an offense is an executive act of a quasi-judicial
                        kind, and does not conflict with or exclude the power of the General Assembly to pass an amnesty act in abolition or oblivion of the offense. State v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 452</cite>, 59
                        S.E. 74, 122 Am. St. R. 464 (1907).

                    <p>
                        The Governor does not possess the constitutional power to parole. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 731</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 188 (1997).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Conditional Pardon. - The Governor may grant a pardon upon a condition precedent that the prisoner pay costs of trial, and upon condition subsequent, that he remain of good character, and be sober and industrious. In re Williams,
                        <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 436</cite>, 63 S.E. 108, 22 L.R.A. (n.s.) 238 (1908).

                    <p>
                        Pardon While Appeal Pending. - The term "conviction" in this section denotes a verdict of guilty rendered by a jury; therefore, when defendant, after verdict and judgment in the court below, appealed to the Supreme Court and, pending such appeal, was
                        pardoned by the Governor, such pardon was authorized by this section and was valid. State v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 231</cite> (1877); State v. Mathis, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 815</cite>,
                        13 S.E. 917 (1891).

                    <p>
                        Commutation of Sentence. - The exercise by the Governor of his judgment, resulting in the commutation of the sentence of one man convicted of murder or rape and the refusal to commute the sentence of another convicted of such crime, cannot be called "freakish"
                        or "arbitrary" merely because another governor might, theoretically, have reached opposite conclusions. State v. Jarrette, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 625</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 721 (1974), death sentence
                        vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3205, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1206 (1976).

                    <p>
                        Sentence Active in Part and Suspended in Part. - It is not within the power of a court to impose a sentence active in part and suspended in part. Where a single offense is involved, the sentence must be made active in full or suspended in full. A split
                        sentence is in effect an anticipatory pardon or parole, violative of the provisions of the Constitution of North Carolina appertaining to pardons and paroles. In re Powell, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 288</cite>,
                        84 S.E.2d 906 (1954).

                    <p>
                        Power of Appointment. - The Governor has the power to appoint an officer of the State with the advice and consent of a majority of the Senators, unless there is some other provision for the appointment. State ex rel. Martin v. Melott,
                        <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 518</cite>, 359 S.E.2d 783 (1987).

                    <p>
                        While the appointments clause itself places no restrictions on the General Assembly's ability to appoint statutory officers, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.130A.html#t130Aa09s130A-309.202ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 130A-309.202(b)</a></cite>                        (Repealed), 143B-291(a1), and 143B-293.2(a1) violate the separation of powers clause; the legislative branch has exerted too much control over commissions that have final executive authority, and by doing so, it has prevented the
                        Governor from performing his express constitutional duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. State ex rel. McCrory v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 633</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 248 (2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Governor's power to appoint officers under the clause thus continues to extend only to constitutional officers; as a result, the appointments clause authorizes the Governor to appoint all constitutional officers whose appointments are not otherwise provided
                        for by the constitution, and it follows that the appointments clause does not prohibit the General Assembly from appointing statutory officers to administrative commissions. State ex rel. McCrory v. Berger,
                        <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 633</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 248 (2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appointments clause does not prohibit the General Assembly from appointing statutory officers; the clause gives the Governor the exclusive authority to appoint constitutional officers whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the constitution
                        and does not prohibit the General Assembly from appointing statutory officers to administrative commissions. State ex rel. McCrory v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 633</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 248 (2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Phrase "whose offices are established by this Constitution" still means "whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the Constitution"; just as the phrase "whose appointments are not otherwise provided for" refers only to those appointments not
                        otherwise provided for in the constitution itself, the phrase "all officers" might refer only to constitutional officers. State ex rel. McCrory v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 633</cite>, 781 S.E.2d
                        248 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Supreme Court of North Carolina concludes that the relevant provisions of 2017 N.C. Sess. Laws 2017-6, when considered as a unified whole, leave the Governor with little control over the views and priorities of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections
                        and Ethics Enforcement by requiring that a sufficient number of its members to block the implementation of the Governor's policy preferences be selected from a list of nominees chosen by the leader of the political party other
                        than the one to which the Governor belongs, limiting the extent to which individuals supportive of the Governor's policy preferences have the ability to supervise the activities of the Bipartisan State Board, and significantly
                        constraining the Governor's ability to remove members of the Bipartisan State Board. Cooper v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 392</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 98 (2018).

                        Manner in which the membership of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement is structured and operates under 2017 N.C. Sess. Laws 2017-6 impermissibly, facially, and beyond a reasonable doubt interferes with the Governor's ability
                        to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed as required by N.C. Const. art. III,

                        Senatorial confirmation of the members of the Governor's Cabinet does not violate the separation of powers clause when the Governor retains the power to nominate them, has strong supervisory authority over them, and has the power to remove them at will.
                        The Governor's power to nominate is significant, and the ultimate appointee will be a person that he alone has chosen, subject only to an up-or-down vote by the Senate. The Governor's supervisory and removal powers, moreover, ensure
                        that the Governor retains ample post-appointment control over how his Cabinet members perform their duties. As a result, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143B.html#t143Ba01s143B-9ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 143B-9(a)</a></cite>'s
                        senatorial confirmation requirement leaves the Governor with enough control to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and therefore does not violate the Separation of Powers Clause. Cooper v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 799</cite>,
                        822 S.E.2d 286 (2018).

                        Power of Appointment Under Constitution of 1868. - Construing Art. III,
                        <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 10, Const. 1868, corresponding to subsection (8) of this section, which prior to 1875 authorized the Governor to appoint "all officers whose offices are established by this Constitution, which shall be created by law,
                        and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for," and prohibited the General Assembly from appointing or electing such officers, along with cognate sections of the Constitution of 1868, in reference to vacancies, etc., prior
                        to 1875, it was held in various decisions that the term, "unless otherwise provided for" meant unless otherwise provided for by the Constitution itself, and that, except in specified and restricted instances, the legislature had
                        no power to appoint to office or to fill vacancies therein. State ex rel. Clark v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 59</cite> (1872); People ex rel. Nichols v. McKee, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. 429</cite> (1873); People

    §
   </span> 10, Const. 1868, as it then existed, and others of kindred nature, were altered by the Convention of 1875, which removed the express prohibition and the express grant of power to the Governor restricted to "all officers
                        whose offices are established by this Constitution and whose offices are not otherwise provided for." And it became the accepted view that, in all offices created by statute, including the directorates of State institutions, the
                        power of appointment, either original or to fill vacancies, was subject to legislative provision as expressed in a valid enactment. See State ex rel. Salisbury v. Croom, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 223</cite>, 83 S.E. 354 (1914);
                        Cunningham v. Sprinkle, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 638</cite>, 33 S.E. 138 (1899); State ex rel. Cherry v. Burns, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 761</cite>, 33 S.E. 136 (1899).

                        Filling Vacancy and Appointing for Regular Term Distinguished. - The Governor never nominates to the Senate to fill vacancies. He does that alone, in all cases. But where officers have to be appointed to fill a regular term, then he nominates to the Senate,
                        unless it be an officer who is elected by the people, and then he never nominates to the Senate, but fills the vacancy or term by his own appointment (unless there is an officer holding over), until the people can elect. People

                        Use of Pardoned Crime to Enhance or Sentence Improper. - The reasoning that an increased punishment for a current offense due to a prior pardoned conviction is not punishment for the prior pardoned offense is a legal fiction that conflicts with logic
                        and the administrative duties of the governor; thus, trial court infringed upon the prerogatives of the governor by finding that defendant's prior conviction constituted an aggravating factor. State v. Clifton,

                        the governor remained fully able to consider and resolve the inmate's clemency request. Bacon v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 696</cite>, 549 S.E.2d 840 (2001).

                        resolving the relevant issues required the court to exercise its fundamental responsibility to determine the proper meaning of N.C. Const., Art. III,

                    <p>
                        In resolving a dispute as to whether certain records pertaining to clemency were subject to the North Carolina Public Records Law, the court noted that neither <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.147.html#t147a03s147-16ol1a1" target="_blank">G.S. 147-16(a)(1)</a></cite>                        nor <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.147.html#t147a03s147-21" target="_blank">G.S. 147-21</a></cite> included any provision specifying whether the records involved in the statutes were considered public records; thus,
                        the court was unable to determine that the General Assembly, in exercising its constitutional authority under N.C. Const., Art. III,

    §

                        Temporary halts in expenditures, escrowing of funds awaiting legislative action, furloughs and other similar actions are constitutional because these actions reduce "total expenditures," and diverting the North Carolina Highway Trust Fund to the State's
                        General Fund and expending the money does not reduce the "total expenditure" of state government but merely transfers money contrary to the budget appropriation statute; a transfer of this nature does not avoid the deficit but
                        merely continues the status quo, which the phrase "necessary economies" under N.C. Const., Art. III,

    §

                        Statutory transfer of money by the General Assembly from the North Carolina Highway Trust Fund to the State's General Fund was appropriate; an Executive Order was read to refer to the General Assembly and the Governor in proclamations as the appropriate

        Duty of Attorney General.
       </b> - The Attorney General of North Carolina is a constitutional officer, and he is required to take an oath which among other things binds him to "support, maintain and defend the Constitution of North Carolina not inconsistent
                        with the Constitution of the United States . . . ." It is but a small step from the language of this oath to the proposition asserted by the Attorney General, that his duty includes the defense of statutes of this State against
                        charges of unconstitutionality. Hendon v. North Carolina State Bd. of Elections, 633 F. Supp. 454 (W.D.N.C. 1986).

                        and authorization by a district attorney, the Special Prosecution Division is to participate in criminal prosecutions only if the Attorney General, in his sole discretion as an independent constitutional officer, approves. Thus
                        trial court exceeded its authority when it ordered that "the Attorney General's Office shall immediately assume the prosecution of" a capital case. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).

                        Commissioner of Insurance. - Although the office of Commissioner of Insurance is one created by this section, his power and authority emanate from the General Assembly and are limited by legislative prescription. The only power he has to fix rates is
                        such power as the General Assembly has delegated to and vested in him. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 262, 300 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied,

                        Superintendent of Public Instruction. - Superior court properly determined that 2016 N.C. Sess. Laws 126 did not unconstitutionally transfer the authority conferred upon the State Board of Education to the Superintendent of Public Instruction because
                        the statutory changes were not inconsistent with the Superintendent's authority as the secretary and chief administrative officer of the Board and as an "elective officer" whose duties were prescribed by law, and the Board's authority
                        to "supervise and administer" the public school system, while the newly enacted statutory language provided that the Superintendent would direct and control all matters relating to the direct supervision and administration of the

                        Judicial Power Vested in General Court of Justice. - The primary purpose of the 1962 amendment, which rewrote Art. IV of the Constitution of 1868, was to establish "a unified judicial system." To accomplish this result, all judicial power, except that
                        vested in a court for the trial of impeachments and in administrative agencies, is now vested by the Constitution in the General Court of Justice. State v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 35</cite>,
                        153 S.E.2d 791 (1967), decided under former Art. IV, Const. 1868, as rewritten in 1962.

                        The judicial power of this state is "vested in a Court for the Trial of Impeachments and a General Court of Justice," and the latter constitutes "a unified judicial system for purposes of jurisdiction, operation, and administration," and includes a Superior

                        The existence of inherent judicial power is not dependent upon legislative action; the General Assembly has recognized the existence of the inherent power of the court and cannot abridge that power. Beard v. North Carolina State Bar,

                        When, in a wrongful death case, a court dismissed a challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction brought months after entry of a default judgment against an employer, dismissing the challenge asserting workers' compensation exclusivity deprived the court
                        of jurisdiction, on equitable estoppel and laches grounds, the court erred because: (1) the court's subject-matter jurisdiction could be contested at any time; (2) subject-matter jurisdiction was independent of the parties' conduct,

                        The application of this section requires three questions be answered: (1) for what purposes was the agency created?; (2) which peculiarly "judicial" power has the General Assembly attempted to vest in the agency?; and (3) is the Legislature's grant of
                        such judicial power reasonably necessary as an incident to the accomplishment of the purposes for which the agency was created? In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act,

                    <p>
                        Considerations Irrelevant to Determination of Whether Judicial Power Properly Conferred. - Considerations such as the maximum size of the civil penalty and the availability of alternative enforcement sanctions are irrelevant to the question of whether
                        a civil penalty is a peculiarly "judicial" power reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of an agency's purposes; since the judiciary does not possess the power to enact specific civil penalties or other alternative enforcement
                        sanctions, these legislative choices are not at issue in determining whether the Legislature has usurped a judicial power which may not be conferred under this section. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of

                    <p>
                        Limitation on Power of Legislature to Alter Judicial Result. - The doctrine of separation of powers precludes the legislature from enacting a statute which alters a result obtained by final judicial decision before the date of the statute's enactment.

                    <p>
                        Presumption of Propriety in Official Acts. - There is a rebuttable presumption that an administrative agency has properly performed its official duties; while arbitrary and capricious agency action is itself prohibited by federal and state due process,
                        any assertion of arbitrary agency action does not necessarily require the agency's action be reviewed for compliance with every other requirement under the State and federal Constitutions. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed

                        Intent of Amendment. - The language employed in the amendment to this section is a clear indication of the people's intent to empower the legislature to interrupt judicial terms of office with an age limit on active service. Martin v. State,
                        <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 412</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 474 (1991).

                        Interpretation of "For Service." - The words, "for service," as used in the amendment to this section refers exclusively to the time during which an individual justice or judge is eligible to serve notwithstanding the length of his or her term of office.
                        The words, "for service," as used in this section therefore, evince an intent to empower the legislature to render particular justices or judges ineligible for active service because of age notwithstanding that time may remain
                        in their terms of office. Martin v. State, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 412</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 474 (1991).

        Election of Judges Not Mandated by Federal Constitution.
       </b> - North Carolina could by Constitution provide for the appointment of all State judges without violating any provision of the federal Constitution. The election of superior court judges is not a necessary characteristic
                        of a republican form of government and is not required by the Constitution of the United States. This is a political rather than a judicial question. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93

                        Judicial elections have a component that implicates the fundamental right to vote and a separate component that is ordinarily the province of the legislature, subject only to review for rationality by the courts, and because the right to vote on equal
                        terms for representatives triggers heightened scrutiny, even as the nonrepresentative aspects inherent in the role of the judiciary preclude strict scrutiny on a one-person, one-vote standard, neither rational basis nor strict
                        scrutiny is an appropriate standard of review; the right to vote in superior court elections on substantially equal terms is a quasi-fundamental right which is subject to a heightened level of scrutiny, and the Equal Protection

        Validity of Superior Court Election, Rotation, and Residency Provisions.
       </b> - There can be no doubt as to the validity under the federal Constitution of the provisions of the North Carolina Constitution requiring the election of superior court judges by districts or statewide as prescribed
                        by the legislature, or that the State be divided into divisions and districts and judges rotate among the districts, or that they reside in their respective districts. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd,
                        409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).

                    <p>
                        A superior court judge is a hybrid official with both local and statewide functions and authority. The requirement that he reside in the district from which he is elected is a matter of convenience, making him available to hear emergency matters, and
                        convenience is an essential factor in arranging an effective judicial system. He rotates among the districts of his division, and may be assigned beyond his division by the Chief Justice. Thus, there is a reasonable basis for election
                        procedure requiring him to be nominated in the primary election and elected in the general election by statewide vote, and it serves and achieves a legitimate State purpose and is not arbitrary and capricious. Holshouser v. Scott,
                        335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).

        The one man, one vote rule does not apply to the State judiciary,
       </b> and therefore a mere showing of a disparity among the voters or in the population figures of the district would not be sufficient to strike down the election procedure for superior court judges. A showing of an arbitrary
                        and capricious or invidious action or distinction between citizens and voters would be required. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).

                        The issuance of a commission by the chief justice assigning a superior court judge to preside over a session of superior court does not endow the judge with jurisdiction, power, or authority to act as a superior court judge; the commission so issued merely
                        manifests that such judge has been duly assigned pursuant to the Constitution to preside over such session of court. The judge's jurisdiction, power, and authority as a superior court judge flow from the Constitution of North Carolina

                    The General Assembly shall, from time to time, divide the State into a convenient number of local court districts and shall prescribe where the District Courts shall sit, but a District Court must sit in at least one place in each county. District Judges
                    shall be elected for each district for a term of four years, in a manner prescribed by law. When more than one District Judge is authorized and elected for a district, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall designate one of the
                    judges as Chief District Judge. Every District Judge shall reside in the district for which he is elected. For each county, the senior regular resident Judge of the Superior Court serving the county shall appoint from nominations submitted
                    by the Clerk of the Superior Court of the county, one or more Magistrates who shall be officers of the District Court. The initial term of appointment for a magistrate shall be for two years and subsequent terms shall be for four years.
                    The number of District Judges and Magistrates shall, from time to time, be determined by the General Assembly. Vacancies in the office of District Judge shall be filled for the unexpired term in a manner prescribed by law. Vacancies
                    in the office of Magistrate shall be filled for the unexpired term in the manner provided for original appointment to the office, unless otherwise provided by the General Assembly.

                        The issuance of a nunc pro tunc commission was unquestionably lawful and in full accord with the Constitution of North Carolina. State v. Eley, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 759</cite>, 392 S.E.2d 394 (1990).

                        The issuance of a commission by the Chief Justice assigning a superior court judge to preside over a session of superior court does not endow the judge with jurisdiction, power, or authority to act as a superior court judge; the commission so issued merely
                        manifests that such judge has been duly assigned pursuant to the Constitution to preside over such session of court. The judge's jurisdiction, power, and authority as a superior court judge flow from the Constitution of North Carolina
                        and his appointment and commission by the Governor as a superior court judge. State v. Eley, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 759</cite>, 392 S.E.2d 394 (1990).

        Validity of Superior Court Election, Rotation, and Residency Provisions.

                        by the legislature, or that the State be divided into divisions and districts and judges rotate among the districts, or that they reside in their respective districts. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd,
                        409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).

                        The system of rotating superior court judges does not deny a defendant due process of law on grounds that in a protracted trial more than one judge might rule on the many motions. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>,

                        Judicial Notice of Assignment of Judges. - The Supreme Court would take judicial notice of the minute book showing the assignment of judges by the Chief Justice, and would take notice that the superior court judge holding the particular term of court
                        in question had been assigned to hold said term. Staton v. Blanton, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 383</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 686 (1963), decided under former Art. IV, Const. 1868.

                            Meaning of Subsection (1). - Subsection (1) of this section, retaining the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over "issues of fact" and "questions of fact" as it had existed prior to the 1971 revision, has no relation to the court's prior original jurisdiction
                            over claims against the State. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Subsection (6) of this section refers to a system of appeals from a lower court to a higher court within the General Court of Justice. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Old Fort Finishing Plant, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 416</cite>,
                            142 S.E.2d 8 (1965).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            When the jurisdiction of a particular court is constitutionally defined, the legislature cannot by statute restrict or enlarge that jurisdiction unless authorized to do so by the Constitution. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>,
                            222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The principle that when the jurisdiction of a particular court is constitutionally defined the legislature cannot by statute restrict or enlarge that jurisdiction unless authorized to do so by the Constitution is grounded on the separation of powers provisions
                            found in many American Constitutions, including the Constitution of this State. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).

                            therefore, after defendant's felony probation was revoked in district court, defendant was allowed to appeal the case to the North Carolina Court of Appeals instead of a superior court. State v. Hooper, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite>                            654, 582 S.E.2d 331 (2003).

                            Where a petition to terminate parental rights was captioned with the names of both children, but the summons that was issued referenced only the younger child, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to terminate the mother's parental rights
                            in the older child because a summons pertaining to the child was not issued. In re C.T., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 643 S.E.2d 23 (2007).

                            Jurisdiction of Court of Appeals. - In a case in which defendant's <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa13s15A-269" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-269</a></cite> motion for post-conviction DNA testing was
                            granted, a hearing was held pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa13s15A-270" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-270</a></cite>, and defendant appealed the trial court's denial of relief, the appellate
                            court lacked jurisdiction. While <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa13s15A-270" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-270</a></cite>.1 provided defendant with the right to appeal the denial of his motion for
                            post-conviction DNA testing, the North Carolina General Assembly had not provided him with the right to appeal a denial of relief, and the North Carolina Constitution mandated that the North Carolina General Assembly prescribe
                            by general law the scope of the jurisdiction of the North Carolina Court of Appeals. State v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 688 S.E.2d 512 (2010).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When defendant was granted relief, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1415" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1415</a></cite>, from 50-year sentences, an appellate court could grant the State's
                            certiorari petition, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIa05s7A-32ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-32(c)</a></cite>, because, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1422ol1c3" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1422(c)(3)</a></cite>,
                            the appeal time had expired and no appeal was pending, and granting the petition was necessary to "supervise and control" the trial court. State v. Wilkerson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 753 S.E.2d 829 (2014).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Appeal of the motion for appropriate relief would have fallen under the statute section by writ of certiorari; given that the state constitution authorizes the General Assembly to define the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to supervise and control
                            trial court proceedings, and there is no limiting language regarding which party may appeal a ruling on a motion for appropriate relief, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to hear an appeal by the State of a motion for appropriate
                            relief when the defendant won relief, and while the appellate rule might appear to limit the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, the rules cannot take away jurisdiction given by the General Assembly. State v. Stubbs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 40</cite>, 770 S.E.2d 74 (2015).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the State constitution gives the General Assembly the power to define the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, only the General Assembly can take away the jurisdiction that it has conferred; subsection (c) of
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIa05s7A-32" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-32</a></cite> thus creates a default rule that the court of appeals has jurisdiction to review a lower court judgment by writ
                            of certiorari, and the default rule will control unless a more specific statute restricts jurisdiction in the particular class of cases at issue. State v. Thomsen, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 22</cite>, 789 S.E.2d 639 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Court of Appeals of North Carolina had jurisdiction to consider a claimant's constitutional challenge to an act of the North Carolina General Assembly on appeal from a final decision and order of the North Carolina Industrial Commission because the claimant's
                            constitutional challenge was not required to be heard by a three-judge panel of the Superior Court of Wake County, North Carolina. In re Redmond, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 490</cite>, 797 S.E.2d
                            275 (2017).

                            Appellate court could grant defendant review by a writ of certiorari after pleading guilty because, while defendant's appeal raised no issue for which an appeal of right was afforded, (1) N.C. Const. art. IV,
                            <span class="s1">

                            Jurisdiction over Civil and Criminal Appeals from District Court. - The constitutional and statutory structure of our General Court of Justice provides that, generally, appeals from the district court in civil causes go to the Court of Appeals, while
                            appeals from the district court in criminal causes must go first to the superior court. State v. Killian, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 212 S.E.2d 419 (1975).

                            Review of Judicial Disciplinary Proceedings. - Under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIa05s7A-32" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-32</a></cite> the courts of the appellate division have
                            power to review judicial disciplinary proceedings, whether the attorney or the State has prevailed in the trial court. In re Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 638</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 784 (1979).

                            The State may seek review by the appellate division of proceedings disciplining attorneys under the judicial method. However, the State may not appeal in such cases as a matter of right, but must seek appellate review by petition for writ of certiorari.

                            Jurisdiction over Eastern Band of Cherokee in Civil Matters. - North Carolina has had civil jurisdiction over the Eastern Band of the Cherokee at least since the emigration west following the Treaty of New Echota, when the Indians remaining in North Carolina
                            became subject to the laws of the State. The fact that these Indians have since been recognized as an Indian tribe and brought under federal supervision did not remove the existing jurisdiction of the State of North Carolina.

                            The Supreme Court is an appellate court. Its function, under the Constitution, is to review alleged errors and rulings of the trial court, and unless and until it is shown that a trial court ruled on a particular question, it is not given for the Supreme
                            Court to make specific rulings thereon. Greene v. Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 435</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 488 (1952).

                            The Supreme Court has supervisory jurisdiction over the lower courts, and will exercise this jurisdiction in order that the case may be tried on the correct theory below and unnecessary delay in the administration of justice be thereby prevented. Greene

                            the jury's finding of any aggravating circumstance upon which the trial court based its sentence of death, (2) the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, or (3)
                            the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. The statute neither contemplates nor requires the court to make factual findings. State v. Lawson, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 632</cite>,

                            Determination of Sufficiency of Amended Complaint. - The Supreme Court, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, could determine the sufficiency of an amended complaint, including matters stricken therefrom in the lower court, as though a demurrer
                            ore tenus to the amended complaint in its entirety had been lodged in the Supreme Court, and its ruling that a pleading, thus considered, was insufficient to state a cause of action necessarily included an affirmance of the
                            order of the lower court sustaining the demurrer ore tenus to the amended complaint exclusive of the portions previously stricken out. Philbrook v. Chapel Hill Hous. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 598</cite>,

                            Determination of Matter Where Appeal Is Premature. - Where an order of the superior court is interlocutory, and an appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court is premature and is subject to dismissal, the Supreme Court in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction
                            may nevertheless, in proper instances, determine the matter in order to obviate a wholly unnecessary and circuitous course of procedure. Edwards v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 137</cite>,

                            Consideration of Questions Not Properly Presented. - The Supreme Court, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, may decide questions on the merits, even though the procedure prescribed by the rules of practice as necessary to present such questions
                            has not been followed. Eastern Steel Prods. Corp. v. Chestnutt, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 269</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 587 (1960).

                            Where the lower court holds the statute attacked by defendant to be unconstitutional, the Supreme Court, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction over the inferior courts, may consider the constitutional questions, notwithstanding that defendant
                            failed properly to present them in the lower court, but even so the Supreme Court will ordinarily consider only the specific constitutional questions discussed in the brief. Rice v. Rigsby,
                            <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 506</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 469 (1963).

                        <p>
                            In the exercise of the constitutional power vested in the Supreme Court to issue any remedial writs necessary to give it a general supervision and control over the proceedings of the inferior courts, the Court would overlook defendant's failure to designate
                            the specific constitutional provisions that he contended 1955 Session Laws, c. 358, violated, and consider the question, even though the procedure prescribed by the rules of practice as necessary to present such question was
                            not followed. Rice v. Rigsby, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 506</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 469 (1963).

                        <p>
                            Ordinarily, the Supreme Court will not consider questions not properly presented by objections duly made, exceptions duly entered, and assignments of error properly set out, though it may do so in exceptional circumstances in the exercise of its supervisory
                            and controlling jurisdiction over the proceedings of the other courts vested in it by this section. State v. Hewett, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 348</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 476 (1967).

                        <p>
                            Under unusual and exceptional circumstances the court will exercise power under this section to consider questions which are not properly presented according to the rules. State v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 19</cite>,

                            Correction of Error in Judgment In Rem Where Appeal Is Subject to Dismissal. - Even though an appeal may be subject to dismissal, if the proceeding is in rem and the judgment entered in the court below vitally affects the title to real property, the Supreme
                            Court will take jurisdiction for the purpose of correcting an error in the judgment. This can be done in the exercise of its supervisory power. Ange v. Ange, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 506</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Review of Habeas Corpus Proceedings. - No appeal to the Supreme Court lies upon the refusal of the judge, having jurisdiction, to release the petitioner in habeas corpus proceedings, except in cases concerning the care and custody of children, the remedy
                            being by application for the writ of certiorari which lies in the discretion of the appellate court. State v. Yates, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 753</cite>, 111 S.E. 337 (1922); State v. Hooker,
                            <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 763</cite>, 111 S.E. 351 (1922); In re Blake, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 278</cite>, 114 S.E. 294 (1922).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A decree in habeas corpus proceedings to determine the custody of a child as between its divorced parents is not appealable, the sole remedy being by certiorari to invoke the constitutional power of the Supreme Court to supervise and control proceedings
                            of inferior courts. In re Ogden, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 100</cite>, 189 S.E. 119 (1937).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although petitioner's purported appeal from a judgment rendered on return to a writ of habeas corpus would ordinarily have been dismissed, it would be treated as a petition for writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court in order that an important question
                            presented by the record might be clarified. In re Renfrow, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 55</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 315 (1957).

                        <p>
                            Certiorari. - Where an application for writ of certiorari in the nature of a writ of error is made for the purpose of bringing up an appeal when the right of appeal is lost in the trial court by failure to file statement of case on appeal within the time
                            allowed, applicant must negative laches and show merit. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 686</cite>, 188 S.E. 421 (1936).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Supreme Court has the power to issue any remedial writ necessary to give it general supervision and control over proceedings of the lower courts, and to this end would grant certiorari to review an order of the superior court ordering the State to
                            pay attorney's fees for representation of an indigent defendant in the federal courts, which involved a question of public importance. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 1</cite>, 153

                            Writ of Error Coram Nobis. - There is no justification for a rule that would require a person who is not in prison to obtain permission from an appellate court in order to file a petition for a writ of error coram nobis to attack collaterally a final
                            judgment of a trial court from which no appeal was taken. Dantzic v. State, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 212</cite>, 182 S.E.2d 563 (1971), overruling In re Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 566</cite>,

                            Remand for Further Consideration. - Where an order of the superior court made no ruling on exceptions to an order of the Public Utilities Commission, but remanded the cause to the Commission for a determination, after further proceedings, of the precise
                            question it had theretofore considered and decided, without specifying the ground on which the court's order was based, the Supreme Court, under the circumstances, in the exercise of its power under this section to issue any
                            remedial writs necessary to give it a general supervision and control over the proceedings of the inferior courts, would vacate the court's order and remand the cause to the superior court for consideration and decision of
                            the questions raised by protestants' exceptions to the Commission's findings and order. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Maybelle Transp. Co., <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 776</cite>, 114 S.E.2d

                            Case in which the State had no right of appeal would be dismissed where the case was not one in which the alleged error appeared on the face of the record proper, which might have been corrected in the Supreme Court's supervisory power under this section,
                            but was to review a ruling of the court entered on motion after trial, as well as an application for certiorari. State v. Todd, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 776</cite>, 32 S.E.2d 313 (1944).

                            Adherence to Theory of Trial in Lower Court. - The principle that an appeal will be determined in accordance with the theory of trial in the lower court is enforced by the Supreme Court because of its limited jurisdiction as an appellate court under this
                            section. Apostle v. Acacia Mut. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 95</cite>, 179 S.E. 444 (1935). See also Ammons v. Fisher, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 712</cite>, 182 S.E. 479 (1935).

                            will, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, ex mero motu if necessary, enforce its opinion and mandate in accordance with the requirements of justice. Collins v. Simms, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 1</cite>,

                            This section abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity, leaving such rights and remedies to be enforced in the one court, which theretofore had administered simply legal rights. Peebles v. Gay,
                            <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 38</cite>, 20 S.E. 173 (1894). See Reynolds v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 578</cite>, 182 S.E. 341 (1935).

                        <p>
                            Distinction Between Principles Is Not Abolished. - Equity is now administered in the same courts as matters of law, but the distinction between equitable and legal principles has not been abolished. Waters v. Garris,
                            <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 305</cite>, 124 S.E. 334 (1924); Furst &amp; Thomas v. Merritt, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 397</cite>, 130 S.E. 40 (1925); Page Trust Co. v. Godwin, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 512</cite>,

                        <p>
                            This section, abolishing the distinctions between actions at law and suits in equity, does not imply that the distinctions as between law and equity are abolished. Principles of law and principles and doctrines of equity, remain the same as they have
                            ever been; the change wrought is in the method of administering them and, in some degree, the extent of the application of them. The abolition does not destroy equitable rights and remedies, nor does it merge legal and equitable
                            rights. Scales v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 772</cite>, 143 S.E. 868 (1928).

                        <p>
                            Inapplicability of Equitable Principle to Contract Action. - This section, providing that legal and equitable remedies be administered in the same court, does not abolish the recognized distinction in the principles applicable to each; and as an action
                            to enforce the provisions of a contract is one at law, the equity that time is not the essence of the contract has no application. Makuen v. Elder, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 510</cite>, 87 S.E.
                            334 (1915).

                            Superior Courts as Successors of Courts of Equity. - Under this section and former Art. IV,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 20, Const. 1868, the superior courts became the successors of the courts of equity, having their jurisdiction and exercising their equitable powers unless restrained by statute. In re Estate of Smith, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 272</cite>,
                            156 S.E. 494 (1931).

                            One Action to Determine Legal and Equitable Rights and Remedies. - Legal and equitable rights and remedies are now determined in one and the same action. Woodall v. North Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 428</cite>,
                            160 S.E. 475 (1931).

                        <p>
                            Animal welfare agency had standing to assert that an injunction and temporary custody order should be entered against the animal owners for the animal owners' alleged neglect and abuse of their animals despite the claim that the animal welfare agency
                            had not suffered a legal injury itself; the North Carolina Constitution abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity, leaving only one court to enforce such rights, and the legislature expressed the
                            intent that the broadest category of persons or organizations be deemed a "real party in interest" when contesting cruelty to animals.appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 690</cite>,
                            652 S.E.2d 254 (2007) Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Woodley, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 640 S.E.2d 777 (2007).

                            Equitable Rights Only Enforceable by Civil Action. - Since the passage of this section the enforcement of an equitable right, as that of subrogation, can only be maintained by a civil action. Calvert v. Peebles, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 334</cite>                            (1880).

                        <p>
                            Rights of Prior Lienor Not Affected. - This section does not affect the rights of a prior lienor by a registered chattel mortgage in favor of a judgment creditor who has sold the personal property by execution under a judgment subsequent to the mortgage
                            lien, or give the creditor a right to levy his execution instead of pursuing the equitable remedy. Rowland Hdwe. &amp; Supply Co. v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 290</cite>, 92 S.E. 13 (1917).

                        <p>
                            Right of Defendant to Know Nature of Demand. - The necessity for drawing pleadings in civil actions according to a prescribed or established precedent ceased when the form of suits was abolished by this section. But one who is brought into court to answer
                            a demand for damages or for specific property has the same fundamental right to know the nature of the demand sufficiently well to enable him, with the aid of competent counsel, to prepare his defense as he has to be informed
                            of an accusation for which he might have to answer criminally. Conley v. Richmond &amp; D.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 692</cite>, 14 S.E. 303 (1891).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Effect of Asking for Ancillary Remedy to Which Party Is Not Entitled. - There being but one form of action in civil cases, the fact that a plaintiff asks for one of the many remedies ancillary thereto, to which he is not entitled, does not affect the
                            action itself, which will go on if he is entitled to any other of the remedies. Hargrove v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 418</cite>, 21 S.E. 916 (1895).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Amendment of Pleadings by Direction of Court. - Where a good cause of action is stated for equitable relief, but is defective in form, the court may require the pleadings to be made definite and certain by amendment, the distinction between suits in equity
                            and actions at law as to jurisdictional matters being abolished by this section. Green v. Harshaw, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 213</cite>, 121 S.E. 456 (1924).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Enforcement of Contracts. - The remedy for the enforcement of all kinds of contracts is now a civil action. Boles v. Caudle, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 528</cite>, 45 S.E. 835 (1903).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Action for Money Had and Received. - Under this section, an exception to a complaint that by its form it is for money had and received, and that the action cannot be maintained unless the money has been actually received, is untenable. Staton v. Webb,
                            <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 35</cite>, 49 S.E. 55 (1904).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Action for Claim and Delivery. - There is no such thing as an action for claim and delivery. Under this section there is but one form of action in civil cases. Hargrove v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 418</cite>,
                            21 S.E. 916 (1895).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mandamus. - There is now in this State but one form of action, and the writ of mandamus is but a process of the court in that action. August Belmont &amp; Co. v. Reilly, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 260</cite> (1874).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No Right to Jury Trial in Equitable Distribution Action. - No right to bring an action for equitable distribution of marital property existed prior to the adoption of the equitable distribution statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-20" target="_blank">G.S. 50-20</a></cite>                            and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-21" target="_blank">G.S. 50-21</a></cite>, and the language of the statutes themselves create no new right to trial by jury; therefore, there is no right
                            to trial by jury for such an action under the Constitution of North Carolina. Kiser v. Kiser, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 502</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 487 (1989).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            No Right to Jury Trial in Action Seeking Attorneys' Fees Under Quantum Meruit. - Trial court did not err in denying a law firm's request for a jury trial on the reasonable value of the attorneys who had provided legal services for a client under a contingency
                            fee agreement and who were then discharged by the client under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 25 and N.C. Const., Art. IV,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 13; until adoption of the modern rule, clients had no right to unilaterally discharge an attorney and force him to pursue a quantum meruit claim, and the right to a jury trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 25 was guaranteed only in cases in which the right and the remedy were in existence when the North Carolina Constitution of 1868 was adopted. Guess v. Parrott, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 325, 585
                            S.E.2d 464 (2003).

                        <p>
                            No Right to Jury in Foreclosure Proceeding. - Denial of a co-owner's motion for a jury trial in his appeal from a clerk's order allowing a foreclosure was proper because, inter alia, N.C. Const., Art. IV,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 13 did not create a constitutional right to trial by jury in all civil cases arising from controversies affecting private rights and redressing private wrongs. In re Foreclosure of Elkins, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite>                            226, 667 S.E.2d 259 (2008).

                        <p>
                            Stockholders' Derivative Actions. - Although stockholders' derivative actions may be equitable actions, they are actions to protect private rights and to redress private wrongs; therefore they are civil actions under this section which guarantees that
                            parties to such actions may have questions of fact tried by juries. Faircloth v. Beard, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 505</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 512 (1987), overruled in part, Jacobs v. City of Asheville,

                            G.S. 8C-1-103(a)(2) permitted appellate review of an evidentiary ruling even though the party failed to object at trial, since G.S. 8C-1-103(a)(2) was inconsistent with N.C. R. App. P. 10(b)(1), G.S. 8C-1-103(a)(2) failed.

                        to pay the additur, since in this State the parties to a civil action have a right to waive a jury trial. Caudle v. Swanson, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 249</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 357 (1958).

                        <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 505</cite>, 177 S.E. 795 (1935).

                    <p>
                        When the right to a jury trial is waived, the facts found by the judge have the force and effect of a verdict by a jury. Upon appropriate assignments of error the Supreme Court may examine the evidence to ascertain if there is any to support the verdict
                        of a jury. It may likewise, upon appropriate assignments, ascertain if the verdict is sufficient to support the judgment, but it cannot enlarge or diminish findings which constitute the verdict. Cauble v. Bell,
                        <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 722</cite>, 107 S.E.2d 557 (1959).

                        The Supreme Court has the right to review findings of fact made with respect to interlocutory orders denying or granting injunctive relief. However, where the judgment is a final determination of the rights of the parties, the mere fact that equitable
                        (injunctive) relief is granted gives the Supreme Court no authority to modify findings determinative of issues of fact raised by the pleadings. Cauble v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 722</cite>,

                        to vote for judges at the expiration of their eight-year terms of office; the right to vote per se is not a fundamental right under North Carolina's Constitution; instead, once the right to vote is conferred, the equal right to

        Validity of Superior Court Election, Rotation, and Residency Provisions.
       </b> - There can be no doubt as to the validity under the federal Constitution of the provisions of the North Carolina Constitution requiring the election of superior court judges by districts or statewide as prescribed
                        by the legislature, or that the State be divided into divisions and districts and judges rotate among the districts, or that they reside in their respective districts. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd,
                        409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).

                    <p>
                        A superior court judge is a hybrid official with both local and statewide functions and authority. The requirement that he reside in the district from which he is elected is a matter of convenience, making him available to hear emergency matters, and
                        convenience is an essential factor in arranging an effective judicial system. He rotates among the districts of his division, and may be assigned beyond his division by the Chief Justice. Thus, there is a reasonable basis for the
                        election procedure requiring him to be nominated in the primary election and elected in the general election by statewide vote, and it serves and achieves a legitimate State purpose and is not arbitrary and capricious. Holshouser

                        In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mischief to be cured by subsection (2) of this section was the inefficiency of removal proceedings under the impeachment and address provisions of the Constitution, not the remedies. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>,
                        250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Subsection (2) of this section must be read in connection with the impeachment provisions of this Article, which it was intended to supplement. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert.
                        denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).

                        Conferral of Original Jurisdiction Over Removal of Judges on Supreme Court. - Ratification of the amendment adding subsection (2) of this section carried with it an expression of the will of the people that the Constitution be amended so as to empower
                        the legislature to confer upon the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over the censure and removal of judges. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While subsection (2) of this section, which is a positive mandate to the legislature to provide a procedure in addition to impeachment for the removal and censure of judges and justices, does not expressly authorize the legislature to confer original
                        jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court over the censure and removal of judges, by clear implication it grants to the legislature authority to confer such jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court. In re Martin,
                        <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).

                        Proceedings before the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission to discipline a sitting judge were dismissed because only the North Carolina Supreme Court or the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission had jurisdiction to discipline
                        sitting judges for conduct in office. N.C. State Bar v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 264</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 743 (2016).

                        Disqualification for Causes Other than Disability Authorized. - Subsection (2) of this section authorizes the General Assembly to disqualify from holding further judicial office a justice or judge who has been removed for causes other than mental or physical
                        disability. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).

                        Codes of judicial conduct may usefully be consulted to give meaning to the constitutional standards. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).

                        When Conduct Is Prejudicial to Administration of Justice. - Whether the conduct of a judge may be characterized as prejudicial to the administration of justice and bringing the judicial office into disrepute depends not so much upon the judge's motives
                        but more on the conduct itself, the results thereof and the impact such conduct might reasonably have upon knowledgeable observers. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d
                        822 (1975).

                    <p>
                        Personal Benefit Irrelevant. - Whether a judge receives any personal benefit from his conduct is wholly irrelevant to an inquiry into the conduct of a judicial officer. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>,
                        223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that a judge received no personal benefit, financial or otherwise, from his conduct does not preclude his conduct from being prejudicial to the administration of justice and bringing the judicial office into disrepute. In re Crutchfield,
                        <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).

                    <p>
                        Disposition of cases for reasons other than an honest appraisal of the facts and the law, as disclosed by the evidence presented, will amount to conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice whenever and however it may be defined or whoever
                        does the defining. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).

                        Judge's execution judgments, allowing limited driving privileges under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-179" target="_blank">G.S. 20-179</a></cite> upon a mere ex parte request without making any
                        effort or conducting any inquiry to ascertain whether the facts recited in the judgments were true and whether he was lawfully entitled to enter the judgments, and without giving the State an opportunity to be heard, when in truth
                        the judgments were supported neither in fact nor in law and were beyond the judge's jurisdiction to enter, constituted a gross abuse of important provisions of the motor vehicle statutes and amounted to conduct prejudicial to the
                        administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).

                        the General Assembly shall prescribe a procedure for the censure and removal of judges in addition to impeachment and address as provided in subsection (1), respondent's contention that the General Assembly, in enacting Article

                        a creature of the General Assembly, was without merit. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).

                        General Assembly has the power to enact a statute not authorized by the present Constitution where the statute is passed in anticipation of an amendment authorizing it or provides that it shall take effect upon the adoption of
                        such an amendment. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).

                        is vested with jurisdiction to act in a case involving the removal from office of a judge. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Supreme Court Action Pursuant to Such Authority Does Not Violate Constitution. - By accepting and acting upon the original jurisdiction authorized by the people under subsection (2) of this section and conferred by the legislature, the Supreme Court does
                        not usurp power constitutionally reserved to another branch of government. Thus, the exercise of such jurisdiction does not violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. In re Martin,
                        <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).

                    <p>
                        A solicitor (now district attorney) is the most responsible officer of the court and has been spoken of as its "right arm." He is a constitutional officer and his duties are presented by the Constitution. State v. McAfee,
                        <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 320</cite>, 127 S.E. 204 (1925); State v. Carden, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 404</cite>, 183 S.E. 898, cert. denied, 298 U.S. 682, 56 S. Ct. 960, 80 L. Ed. 1402 (1936), decided under Art. IV,

                    <p>
                        The clear mandate of this section is that the responsibility and authority to prosecute all criminal actions in the superior courts is vested solely in the several district attorneys of the State. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>,
                        406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Delegation of Prosecutorial Function. - The elected district attorney may, in his or her discretion and where otherwise permitted by law, delegate the prosecutorial function to others. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>,
                        406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Discretion of District Attorney. - While the district attorney has broad discretion to decide in a homicide case whether to try defendant for first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or manslaughter, he/she has no discretion whether to try defendant
                        capitally or noncapitally for first-degree murder. State v. Rorie, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 266</cite>, 500 S.E.2d 77 (1998).

                        District Attorney's Lack of Discretion in Capital Cases Not Unconstitutional. - Section 15A-2000 does not conflict with this section; in other words, the district attorney's lack of discretion as to whether to try a defendant capitally or noncapitally
                        for first-degree murder does not impermissibly conflict with the prosecutor's constitutional duty to prosecute criminal actions on behalf of the State, although he does have broad discretion in a homicide case to determine whether
                        to try a defendant for first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or manslaughter. State v. Blakeney, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 287</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 799 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1117, 121 S.

                        Public Nuisances. - The State, through the district attorney, has not only the authority, but also as an advocate of the State's interest in protecting society, an implied duty to bring public nuisance actions. Whitfield v. Gilchrist,

                    <p>
                        Authority of Trial Court Exceeded. - The trial court exceeded its authority and invaded the province of an independent constitutional officer when it ordered the district attorney to request that the Attorney General prosecute defendant in a capital case.
                        State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).

                    <p>
                        The trial court exceeded its authority by ordering that in order to avoid the possibility or impression of any conflict of interest, the district attorney and his entire staff must withdraw from a capital case and have no further participation either
                        directly or indirectly with regard to the case. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).

                        Standing to Challenge District Attorney's Participation. - Magistrate did not have standing to challenge involvement of the District Attorney in magistrate's removal proceeding, where, had trial court the inherent authority to appoint an independent counsel,
                        magistrate could not show that a different result would have occurred. In re Ezzell, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 438 S.E.2d 482 (1994).

                        Removal of District Attorneys. - Neither this section nor any other provision of the Constitution of North Carolina prohibits the General Assembly from enacting a statutory method for the removal of district attorneys from office, so long as district
                        attorneys whose removal from office is sought are accorded due process of law. In re Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 404</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 693 (1997).

        Legislature's Authority to Prescribe Duties for District Attorneys.
       </b> - There was no state law that would allow a city to delegate its policymaking authority to a state prosecutor, and, pursuant to N.C. Const., Art. IV,
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 18(1), only the state legislature had authority to prescribe duties for District Attorneys or supervise the District Attorney's exercise of authority; thus, the claims against a prosecutor in his "official capacity"
                        were claims against the State. McFadyen v. Duke Univ., 786 F. Supp. 2d 887 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 31, 2011), aff'd and rev'd in part, 703 F.3d 636 (2012).

                        Employment of Private Counsel. - A district attorney's decision to employ private counsel to assist the district attorney in bringing a public nuisance action in the name of the State is similar to a district attorney's decision to permit a private attorney
                        to assist in a criminal action; thus, the state constitution and this section, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIIa09s7A-61" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-61</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.147.html#t147a08s147-89" target="_blank">G.S. 147-89</a></cite>                        do not prohibit employing private counsel.

                        his resignation from office created an actual vacancy in that position.

        Interpretation of first sentence.
       </b> - The language of the first sentence of Sec. 22 of Art. IV of the NC Const. is unambiguous. No person is eligible for election or appointment as a justice or judge unless that person is duly authorized to practice law
                        in the courts of this state. That is the only qualification mandated by Sec. 22. The second sentence exempts from this requirement those persons elected to or serving in such capacities on or before January 1, 1981. See opinion
                        of Attorney General to Honorable Jim Gulley, Representative, 2009 N.C.A.G. 4 (09/16/09).

        Interpretation of second sentence.
       </b> - The second sentence of Sec. 22 of Art. IV of the NC Const. is a complete "grandfather" clause, exempting any person elected to or serving as a judge or justice on or before January 1, 1981. The exemption applies during
                        any such person's life time and forever exempts them from Sec. 22. If a person was not elected to or serving as a judge or justice on or before January 1, 1981, that person must be duly authorized to practice law in the courts
                        of this state to be eligible for election or appointment as a Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge of the Court of Appeals, Judge of the Superior Court, or Judge of District Court. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Jim

                            use tax act, see Sykes v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 398</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 775 (1968).

                            Taxes and Local Assessments for Public Improvements Distinguished. - There is a distinction between local assessments for public improvements and taxes levied for purposes of general revenue. It is true that local assessments may be a species of tax,
                            and that the authority to levy them is generally referred to the taxing power, but they are not taxes within the meaning of that term as generally understood in constitutional restrictions and exemptions. Southern Ry. v. City

                            Police Power More Extensive Than Legislative Authority to Expend Tax Money. - The power of the State to regulate privately owned institutions under its police power is more extensive than the authority of the legislature to expend tax money for the accomplishment
                            of the same purpose. Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973).

                            Laches as Bar to Constitutional Challenge to 1970 Amendments. - Where more than 18 years elapsed between the 1970 ballot and the defendants' claim of unconstitutionality of the 1970 amendments and where taxpayer stated that he did not recognize the effects
                            of the amendment until his taxes rose in 1985, he did not claim that he was precluded from ascertaining the import of the amendment or the constitutionality of its passage before 1985, or until January 8, 1989, when he filed
                            his answer, a county was materially prejudiced by the defendants' delay because the passage of time prevented the county from presenting evidence supporting the fact that the ballot was understandable to voters. Franklin County

                            While the mere passage of years does not in itself entitle the plaintiff to the bar of laches, an unreasonable length of time resulting in prejudice to the opposing party does so entitle the plaintiff. Franklin County v. Burdick,

                            Legislature had a rational basis for taxing businesses hosting live entertainment differently than moving picture shows, as the former placed greater demands on public resources, created greater risks, and generated larger revenues than the latter. Deadwood,

                        <p>
                            A sovereign state, as one of its inherent attributes, has the power of taxation, which must be exercised by its legislative branch. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).

                            A county is not a sovereign and does not have inherent power to levy taxes. A county must derive its taxing power from the State Constitution or from the State's legislative enactments. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>,

                            A county board of elections does not have taxing power. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).

                        <p>
                            The power to levy taxes is the exclusive province of the legislature, and the superior court has no jurisdiction of an action, the nature and purpose of which is to discover, to list and to assess for taxation, property which has escaped taxation. Henderson

                            The term "public purpose," when used in connection with the expenditure of municipal funds from the public treasury, refers to such public purpose within the frame of governmental and proprietary power given to the particular municipality, to be exercised
                            for the benefit, welfare and protection of its inhabitants and others coming within the municipal care. It involves reasonable connection with the convenience and necessity of the particular municipality whose aid is extended

                            The term "public purposes" is employed in the same sense in the law of taxation and in the law of eminent domain. Thus, if the General Assembly may authorize a State agency to expend public money for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a hospital
                            facility to be leased to and ultimately conveyed to a private agency, it may also authorize the acquisition of a site for such facility by exercise of the power of eminent domain. Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n,

                            Concept of "Public Purpose" Expands with Changing Conditions. - A slide-rule definition to determine the meaning of "public purpose" for all time cannot be formulated; the concept expands with the population, economy, scientific knowledge, and changing
                            conditions. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970); In re Denial of Approval to Issue Hous. Bonds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 52</cite>,

                            For a use to be public its benefits must be in common and not for particular persons, interests, or estates; the ultimate net gain or advantage must be the public's, as contradistinguished from that of an individual or private entity. Martin v. North

                            The power to appropriate money from the public treasury is no greater than the power to levy the tax which put the money in the treasury. Both powers are subject to the constitutional proscription that tax revenues may not be used for private individuals
                            or corporations, no matter how benevolent. Mitchell v. North Carolina Indus. Dev. Fin. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 137</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 745 (1968); Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp.,

                            Fact that moneys are paid to an individual does not affect the character of the expenditure, since the object of the expenditure and not to whom it is paid determines whether it is for a public purpose. Green v. Kitchin,

                            When Direct Disbursement of Public Funds to Private Entity Is Permissible. - Under subsection (7) of this section, direct disbursement of public funds to private entities is a constitutionally permissible means of accomplishing a public purpose, provided

                            Direct Assistance to Private School Is Not Permissible. - Direct assistance to private entities such as the Dyslexia School of North Carolina, Inc., distinguishable from direct disbursements to students for educational purposes, may not be the means used
                            to effect a public purpose. Hughey v. Cloninger, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 245 S.E.2d 543 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 86</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 898 (1979).

                            Even though the Dyslexia School of North Carolina, Inc., a private nonprofit corporation, is engaged in a clearly benevolent activity, which would not be constitutionally prohibited if provided through the public schools of Gaston County, it remains a
                            private entity. As such, it may not receive appropriations and expenditures from public funds of Gaston County in order to achieve the desirable and commendable end of assisting in the education of the dyslexic children of

                            Legislature Initially Determines What Is Public Purpose. - The initial responsibility for determining what is and what is not a public purpose rests with the legislature, and its findings with reference thereto are entitled to great weight. In re Denial

                            Legislative Declarations Are Not Conclusive. - A legislative declaration which asserts in general terms that the statute under consideration is enacted for a public purpose, although entitled to great weight, is not conclusive. When the facts are determined,
                            what is a public purpose is a question of law for the court. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).

                            If an enactment is in fact for a private purpose, and therefore unconstitutional, it cannot be saved by legislative declarations to the contrary. When a constitutional question is properly presented, it is the duty of the court to ascertain and declare
                            the intent of the framers of the Constitution, and to reject any legislative act which is in conflict therewith. In re Denial of Approval to Issue Hous. Bonds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 52</cite>,

                            A "tax" within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition against nonuniformity of taxation is a charge levied and collected as a contribution to the maintenance of the general government. It is imposed upon the citizens in common, at regularly recurring
                            periods, for the purpose of providing a continuous revenue. State ex rel. Dorothea Dix Hosp. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 147</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 698 (1977).

                            Requirement of Uniformity Extends to License, Franchise and Other Forms of Taxation. - Repeated judicial interpretations extend the requirement of uniformity to license, franchise, and other forms of taxation. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton,

                            Although it is not expressly provided that the tax on trades, etc., shall be uniform, yet a tax not uniform, as properly understood, would be so inconsistent with natural justice, and with the intent which is apparent in the Constitution that it may be
                            admitted that the collection of such a tax would be restricted as unconstitutional. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).

                            When Tax Is Uniform. - A tax is uniform when it is equal upon all persons belonging to the described class upon which it is imposed. Gatlin v. Town of Tarboro, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. 119</cite> (1878); State v. Danenberg,
                            <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 718</cite>, 66 S.E. 301, 26 L.R.A. (n.s.) 890 (1909); Leonard v. Maxwell, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 89</cite>, 3 S.E.2d 316, appeal dismissed, 308 U.S. 516, 60 S. Ct. 175, 84 L. Ed. 439 (1939).

                        <p>
                            Taxing is required to be by a uniform rule, that is, by one and the same unvarying standard. Uniformity in taxing implies equality in the burden of taxation, and this equality of burden cannot exist without uniformity in the mode of assessment, as well
                            as in the rate of taxation. But this is not all. The uniformity must be coextensive with the territory to which it applies. If a State tax, it must be uniform all over the State. If a county or city tax, it must be uniform
                            throughout the extent of the territory to which it is applicable. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Uniformity consists in putting the same tax upon all of the same class; that is, while the same tax must be enforced upon all innkeepers, upon all railroads, and so on throughout, a tax discriminating among persons of the same class, whereby some are
                            required to pay more than others, would lack uniformity. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Equality within the class or for those of like station and condition is all that is required to meet the test of constitutionality under subsection (2) of this section. A tax on trades, etc., must be considered uniform when it is equal upon all persons
                            belonging to the prescribed class upon which it is imposed. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Uniformity of taxation is accomplished when the tax is levied equally and uniformly on all subjects in the same class, and the right to classify imports a difference in the subjects of taxation. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 332</cite>,

                            Uniformity with Reference to Locality and Classification. - With reference to locality, a tax is uniform when it operates with equal force and effect in every place where the subject of it is found, and with reference to classification, it is uniform
                            when it operates without distinction or discrimination upon all persons composing the described class. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).

                            Scientific Uniformity Is Not Required. - The State may impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions and may vary the rate of excise upon various products. It is not required to resort to close distinctions or to maintain a precise,
                            scientific uniformity with reference to composition, use or value. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 66</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 766 (1974).

                            since one tax will be imposed by the city for municipal purposes and the other by the county for county purposes. Further, double taxation is prohibited by neither the State nor federal Constitutions. Jamison v. City of Charlotte,

                            fix the boundaries of such district so as to include two or more counties or towns or even to make the district wholly independent of such political boundaries. Taxing districts may be as numerous as the purposes for which
                            taxes are levied. Equality and uniformity of taxation does not preclude the power of the State to create separate taxing districts, provided the taxes are equal and uniform within each taxing district. State ex rel. Dyer v.

                            Reasonableness of Classification. - The classification must not be arbitrary or unjust, but must be based on substantial and reasonable differences between the classes. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Doughton, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 145</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The power of the legislature to classify subjects for the purpose of taxation is flexible, and the reasonableness of any classification will generally be construed with reference to the facts of the particular case, the predominant limitation on the power
                            to classify being that the classification must be reasonable and not arbitrary and must rest upon some substantial difference between the classes, and that the burden must be equal upon all in the same class. Southern Grain

                        <p>
                            The classification of subjects for taxation must be based upon reasonable distinctions and must apply equally to all within each class defined. Snyder v. Maxwell, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 617</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 19 (1940).

                        <p>
                            While the General Assembly may not establish a classification that is arbitrary or capricious, a classification is constitutional if it is founded upon a reasonable distinction or difference and bears a substantial relation to the object of the legislation.

                        <p>
                            The only limitation upon the power of classification is that the classification be founded upon reasonable, and not arbitrary, distinctions. In re Champion Int'l Corp., <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 639, 329 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            A classification will be upheld if it is reasonable and not arbitrary and rests upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced will be treated alike.

                            On review, wide latitude is accorded the General Assembly; the only limitation on its power is that the classification must be founded upon reasonable, and not arbitrary, distinctions.

                            Courts to Determine Validity of Classifications. - The uniformity rule of this section requires the courts, when the validity of a tax statute is challenged on the ground of discrimination, to ascertain if in fact there is a difference in the classes

                            Local Assessment Based on Benefits. - The constitutional provision that taxation shall be equal, uniform, and (under previous constitutions provisions) within certain limits does not apply to local assessments imposed upon owners of property, who in respect
                            to such ownership are to derive a special benefit in the local improvements for which the tax is expended. Cain v. Commissioners of Davie County, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 8</cite> (1882).

                            While assessments on lands abutting on improved streets are not required to be uniform with all other subjects of taxation, and in view of the particular benefits, such must be uniform as to all property owners within that class to meet the constitutional
                            requirements. City of Gastonia v. Cloninger, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 765</cite>, 123 S.E. 76 (1924).

                            Property Is Taxable Without Regard to Ownership. - By virtue of the provisions of this section, all property, real and personal, in this State, is subject to taxation, in accordance with a uniform rule, under laws which the General Assembly is required
                            by the Constitution to enact, without regard to its ownership, and without regard to the purposes for which specific property is held, unless it is exempted by or under the provisions of this section. Latta v. Jenkins,

                            Additional Sales Tax in Certain Counties. - The Constitution does not permit State to levy a tax which discriminates in favor of or against taxpayers in the same classification, and this prohibition extends throughout the State. Hence, the State may not
                            levy a tax in 25 counties and exempt 75 counties. Nor may the State set up a valid scheme by which that precise result is accomplished. Thus, additional 1% sales and use tax authorized by the Local Option Sales and Use Tax
                            Act, which was a State tax, not a county tax, was unconstitutional since it was not uniformly applied to all taxpayers of the same class in all counties of the State. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton,
                            <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).

                            Levy imposed by the Local Option Sales and Use Tax Act was discriminatory in that it required one person to pay the tax involved and exempted his competitor in a county which voted against the tax. Both Nash and Edgecombe were exempt if either voted against
                            the tax. Uniformity is required. No provision was made for partial uniformity, and for that reason the tax authorized under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105s0Ia05s105-164.45" target="_blank">G.S. 105-164.45</a></cite>                            was unconstitutional.

                            satellite service, but not on cable television service, does not discriminate against satellite providers in favor of cable companies on its face and in its practical effect because the differential tax results solely from

                            Tax on Receipt of Proceeds of Life Insurance Policy. - Public Laws 1937, c. 127, G.S. 11, could not be construed as imposing an excise tax upon the receipt of the proceeds of life insurance policies issued to the beneficiary who retained all rights and
                            liabilities thereunder, in addition to imposing an inheritance tax on the proceeds of policies issued to the insured or in which he retained some incidents of ownership, since such excise tax would have to be computed in accordance
                            with a graduated scale on the basis of the amount of insurance together with the value of the estate or the legacy or the distributive share, and thus would produce inequality in the levying of such excise tax in contravention

                            Exemption of Farm Products. - The exception of farm products purchased from the producer from the return required to be made by merchants and other dealers as the basis for a license tax is not a discrimination against the products or citizens of other
                            states; nor is it in violation of this section, which requires uniformity of taxation. State v. Stevenson, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 730</cite>, 14 S.E. 385 (1891); Ex parte Brown, 48 F. 435

                            kind of merchandise separately from those whose business it is to sell other articles falling within the same generic terms. Rosenbaum v. City of Newbern, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 83</cite>,

                            Fireman's Pension Fund. - Session Laws 1957, c. 1420, creating the North Carolina Fireman's Pension Fund, violated this section for lack of uniformity, in that it exempted members of the Farmers' Mutual Fire Insurance Association from adding the tax imposed
                            by the act to their premiums and collecting it from purchasers of their insurance, as other companies selling similar insurance were required to do by the act. American Equitable Assurance Co. v. Gold,

                            Hotelkeepers. - A tax is uniform and consistent with this section when it is equal on all persons in the same class; and hence a tax imposed on hotelkeepers, which exempts from taxation those whose yearly receipts are less than $1,000.00, is not unconstitutional.

                            Household Property. - Because there is some reasonable relationship between the value of a home and the value of the household property within, the percentage method is a reasonable one in accomplishing the object of determining the market value of household
                            property, and thus there is no violation of subsection (2) of this section. In re Bosley, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 224 S.E.2d 686, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 551</cite>,

                            Mechanical Vending Devices. - While the legislature may not classify mechanical vending machines in accordance with the kinds of merchandise sold by such machines in levying privilege taxes on their use, since the manner in which the article is sold is
                            the same in all instances and the economic advantages in this method of sale may be regarded as the same, it may classify mechanical vending devices for the purpose of taxation and make a further classification or subclassification
                            in accordance with the quantity or kind of commodities sold by such method, when such classifications are based upon real and reasonable distinctions. Snyder v. Maxwell, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 617</cite>,

                            Real Estate Brokers. - Public-Local Laws 1927, c. 241, requiring real estate brokers in certain designated counties to be licensed by a real estate commission on the basis of moral character and proficiency in the public interest, and requiring payment
                            of a license fee in addition to the statewide license required, was unconstitutional, as it applied only to real estate brokers in the designated counties and was therefore discriminatory. State v. Warren,

                            Wholesale Grocers. - A special classification by statute of wholesale grocers operating a cold storage chamber of some character for the preservation of fresh meats, as distinguished from those who handled only canned meats not requiring refrigeration,
                            was a reasonable classification imposing an equal burden upon all of the class, and was constitutional and valid. Southern Grain Provision Co. v. Maxwell, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 661</cite>,

                            from taxation beyond the permissive power granted it by this section. Sir Walter Lodge, No. 411 v. Swain, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 632</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 365 (1940).

                            Strict Construction of Exemptions. - Statutes enacted by the General Assembly exempting specific property from taxation, because of the purposes for which such property is held and used, are and should be construed strictly, when there is room for construction
                            against exemption and in favor of taxation. Salisbury Hosp. v. Rowan County, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 8</cite>, 169 S.E. 805 (1933); Piedmont Mem. Hosp. v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 673</cite>,

                            Tax Exemption for State and Local Government Employees' Retirement Benefits. - The tax exemption for retirement benefits of state and local employees was a term or condition of retirement systems to which the employees had a contractual right and it did
                            not constitute an unconstitutional contracting away of the state's sovereign power of taxation. Bailey v. State, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 130</cite>, 500 S.E.2d 54 (1998).

                            Section Applies Only to Ad Valorem Taxes. - Any intent or attempt, on the part of the legislature, to grant an exemption from any tax or assessment on real property, pursuant to the provisions of this section, other than for ad valorem taxes, would be
                            without constitutional authorization. Raleigh Cem. Ass'n v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 509</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 506 (1952).

                            Former G.S. 160-521, exempting railroad right-of-way property from assessment for local improvements, was not unconstitutional on grounds that it was not authorized by this section, since this section deals with the power of taxation and not with assessments

                            Property in Hands of Trustee. - Where, in construing a devise of various property in a city, the courts decreed that the lands should be sold within a period of five years and that 55% of the proceeds should be distributed among several beneficiaries
                            of the class exempted by this section, the property itself was not held by the beneficiaries designated, but by the trustee in trust for the purpose of sale and distribution of part of the proceeds of the sale to them, and
                            the exemption only applied to the proceeds of the sale when received by the beneficiaries in accordance with the decree, and the lands in the hands of the trustee were subject to taxation. Latta v. Jenkins,

                            Applies Regardless of Purpose for Which Property Is Held. - Property owned by the State is exempt from ad valorem taxation by subsection (3) of this section solely by reason of State ownership. Thus, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105sIIa12s105-278.1" target="_blank">G.S. 105-278.1</a></cite>,
                            requiring property owned by the State to be held exclusively for a public purpose in order to be exempt from taxation, is unconstitutional. Therefore, the Towns of Chapel Hill and Carrboro and the County of Orange may not assess
                            ad valorem taxes against any property owned by the Univ. of North Carolina, an agency of the State, regardless of the purpose for which the property is held. In re Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 563</cite>, 268

                            of being at least a subordinate branch of the State government or of a local subdivision thereof and subject to governmental visitation and control, so that ordinarily the interests and franchises pertaining to the corporation

                            Provision as to Exemption of Property Used for Educational, etc., Purposes Is Not Self-Executing. - Under subsection (3) of this section, the legislature may exercise, to the full extent or in part, the power to exempt from taxation property held for
                            educational, scientific, literary, charitable or religious purposes, or may decline to exempt such property at all. The constitutional provision being in the disjunction, the legislature may exempt the property up to a certain
                            value and tax all above it, and may also tax property held for one of the purposes named and exempt that held for others. Congregation of United Brethren v. Commissioners of Forsyth County,

                            The provision of this section that the General Assembly may exempt from taxation property held for educational, scientific, literary, charitable or religious purposes is a grant of power and is not self-executing, and the power of the legislature to prescribe
                            such exemptions is limited by the terms of the grant. Piedmont Mem. Hosp. v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 673</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 265 (1940).

                            Nor Is Provision as to Property Used as Residence. - The third sentence of subsection (3) of this section is only permissive in terms and is not self-executing. The power of exemption, to the extent therein mentioned, is exercisable, in whole or in part,
                            or not at all, as the General Assembly, in its wisdom, shall determine. Nash v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 301</cite>, 190 S.E. 475 (1937).

                            Power of Legislature to Grant Such Exemptions Is Limited. - The power of the legislature to exempt from taxation property not owned by the State or its political subdivisions is limited and restricted by the scope of the constitutional grant of the permissive
                            power of exemption. County of Rockingham v. Board of Trustees, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 342</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 618 (1941). See also, Trustees of Guilford College v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 347</cite>,

                            Use to Which Property Is Devoted Controls. - Under this section, it is the use to which the property is devoted and to the extent of the interest so dedicated which should control, rather than the title or other tenure by which it is held, and its provisions
                            are broad and comprehensive enough to uphold the legislative exemption as to all property used exclusively for educational purposes. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Oxford Sem. Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 582</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The power granted to the legislature to exempt property from taxation is limited by the language of this section to property held for educational, scientific, charitable or religious purposes, the purpose for which the property is held and not the character
                            of the corporation or association holding the property being the basis for the grant of permissive power to exempt; and thus, the legislature has no power to exempt property held by a religious or charitable corporation or
                            organization for business or commercial purposes. Sir Walter Lodge, No. 411 v. Swain, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 632</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 365 (1940).

                            Weight of Fact That Institution Has Not Been Paying Taxes. - The fact that an educational incorporation had gone for a long period of time without paying taxes, unchallenged by both the legislative and executive department of the government, is deserving
                            of great weight by the court in construing this section. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Oxford Sem. Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 582</cite>, 76 S.E. 640 (1912).

                            No Distinction Between Public and Private Institutions. - The provisions of this section make no distinction between public and private educational corporations, or between institutions which are in part conducted for the personal profit of the owner
                            and those which are run on a salary basis, using any profits which may arise in the extension of the work. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Oxford Sem. Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 582</cite>,

                            Church Lot. - A lot purchased by the trustee of a church for the purpose of erecting a new church and Sunday school thereon, which pending the accumulation of sufficient funds to build the new church, was used exclusively for open air Sunday school and
                            church meetings, was property held for religious purposes within the meaning of this section, and the legislature had the power to exempt such property from taxation. Harrison v. Guilford County,
                            <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 718</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 269 (1940).

                            Property owned by a church and rented by it for commercial purposes, and the rent used for religious purposes, is not exempt from taxation. Sparrow v. Beaufort County, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 222</cite>, 19 S.E.2d 861

                            Business property owned by an educational institution and rented to private enterprises for offices and business purposes, the net profit derived therefrom being devoted exclusively to educational purposes, was not within the exemption granted by this
                            section. County of Rockingham v. Board of Trustees, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 342</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 618 (1941). See also, Trustees of Guilford College v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 347</cite>,

                            Property of North Carolina Housing Finance Agency. - Since <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122A</a></cite> and the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency's activities pursuant
                            thereto are for a public purpose, it is permissible for the General Assembly to exempt from taxation the property of the Agency and the obligations incurred by the Agency to effectuate such public purpose. Martin v. North Carolina
                            Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).

                        <p>
                            Bonds. - A legislative provision exempting the property and bonds of a city from taxation is valid when the bonds are to be issued for a public purpose, and certainly the bonds are exempt from taxation if sold to and held by an agency of the United States
                            government, or are held by a purchaser from such federal agency. Any doubt as to the validity of this provision under this section must be resolved in favor of its validity. Webb v. Port Comm'n,
                            <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 663</cite>, 172 S.E. 377 (1934).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bonds issued by a municipality to provide schoolhouses and equipment were for a public purpose, and since the bonds, although the property of a private corporation, were issued for a necessary public purpose and purchased in reliance upon the statutory
                            provision exempting them from taxation, they would stand upon the same footing as the school buildings erected with the proceeds of the bonds. County of Mecklenburg v. Piedmont Fire Ins. Co.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 171</cite>, 185 S.E. 654 (1936).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the enumerated properties under this section do not expressly include bonds issued by the State or any State agency, whether revenue bonds or full faith and credit bonds, it is nevertheless generally considered that the legislature of a state has
                            the power to exempt state and municipal bonds from taxation, since if such bonds are exempt from taxation the state or municipality will be able to issue them on more favorable terms and may then save more money than it would
                            lose by being deprived of the right to tax them. A legislature may exempt such securities from taxation, even if the Constitution enumerates the subjects of exemption, and does not specifically name government securities, and
                            even in the face of a constitutional declaration forbidding passage of laws exempting any property. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>,
                            174 S.E.2d 551 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The provisions of Session Laws 1967, c. 1177 (G.S. 116-209.1 et seq.) that exempt student loan revenue bonds from taxation by the State or by any of its subdivisions do not contravene this section. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville,
                            <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 551 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the tax-exempt feature makes possible the more favorable sale of revenue bonds and thereby contributes substantially to the accomplishment of the public purpose for which they are issued, the General Assembly may exempt such bonds from taxation
                            by the State or any of its subdivisions. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).

         Local School Administrative Unit Levying Taxes at Local Level.

                            Effect of Subsection (2). - For case construing provisions from which subsection (2) of this section was derived as the dominant or controlling limitation upon the power of local units to contract debts or to issue bonds, see Coe v. Surry County,
                            <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 125</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 910 (1946).

                        <p>
                            The limitation prescribed by provisions from which subsection (2) of this section was derived was in addition to other constitutional limitations relating to taxation prescribed by this section and N.C. Const., Art. V,

    §
   </span> 6; thus, a county may not borrow money, even for a necessary expense, without submitting the question to a vote, when its outstanding indebtedness has not been reduced during the prior fiscal year, and a taxpayer
                            is entitled to injunctive relief restraining the issuance of the proposed bonds. Hallyburton v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 9</cite>, 195 S.E. 21 (1938).

                            The language of provision from which subsection (2) of this section was derived was unambiguous; by its plain terms the power of any county or municipality to contract debts in any fiscal year, without submitting the matter to a vote of the people, except
                            for those purposes specifically enumerated in the amendment, is definitely prescribed to two-thirds of the amount by which its outstanding indebtedness was decreased during the prior fiscal year. Hallyburton v. Board of Educ.,

                            The Constitution gives the people the power to decide whether or not to contract a debt by requiring their duly elected representatives to submit the question to them for their approval before the indebtedness is assumed. Vance County v. Royster,

                            The constitutional provision imposing a limitation upon the power of the State, counties and municipalities to contract debts without a vote of the people does not deprive the county of any power to contract a debt. It merely declares who shall have the
                            power of decision. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967); Cole v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 652, 163 S.E.2d 628

                            The Constitution proceeds upon the theory that if it is, indeed, wise to contract an indebtedness for an unnecessary county or city expense, the people of the county or city will recognize this when the facts are presented to them and will approve the
                            assumption of the obligation; and if they do not approve it, it ought not to be undertaken at their expense even though the county or city commissioners, and the courts as well, deem it wise to do so. Vance County v. Royster,

                            The term "municipal corporation" should not be construed narrowly to include only cities, towns, counties and school districts, as the Constitution contemplates a broader construction of the term. In its broader sense, the term includes all public corporations
                            exercising governmental functions within the constitutional limitations. Wells v. Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 744</cite>, 197 S.E. 693 (1938); Carolina-Virginia Coastal Hwy. v.

                            In determining the amount of debt contracted in any fiscal year within the provision of subsection (2) of this section, limiting the power of a taxing unit to contract debts to two-thirds the amount by which the taxing unit's outstanding debt was decreased
                            during the prior fiscal year, the total amount of bonds issued during the fiscal year, by the taxing unit, whether with or without the approval of its voters, should be included, except bonds issued by it to fund or refund
                            a valid existing debt, to supply a casual deficit, to suppress riots or insurrections, or to repel invasions, and except tax anticipation notes issued in an amount not exceeding 50% of the taxes for the fiscal year. Hallyburton

                            Refunding Bonds. - A municipal corporation does not contract a "debt" when under statutory authority it issues bonds to refund bonds which at the date of the issuance of the refunding bonds are valid and enforceable obligations of the corporation. Bolich

                            Where a proposed county bond issue was to refund a valid existing debt of the county within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section, under the exception therein provided a vote was unnecessary, nor could the means for the repayment of the bonds
                            be adversely affected by any constitutional change. Thompson v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 214</cite>, 193 S.E. 158 (1937).

                            Where, during the prior fiscal year, defendant county began refunding operations, and during that year issued its refunding bonds, but did not retire the bonds refunded until the first day of the present fiscal year, and where plaintiff contended that
                            since both the refunding bonds and the bonds refunded were outstanding during the prior fiscal year, that there had been an increase rather than a decrease in the county's outstanding indebtedness during the prior fiscal year,
                            it was held that the failure of the county to complete its refunding operations during the prior fiscal year was immaterial, and that the refunding bonds should not be included in determining the amount by which the county
                            had reduced its outstanding indebtedness during the prior fiscal year within the meaning of the constitutional limitation on an increase of debt by counties and municipalities. Royal v. Sampson County,

                            it had reduced its outstanding indebtedness during the prior fiscal year, the purpose of subsection (2) of this section being to limit the existing power of the governing authorities to issue bonds for necessary expenses so
                            that the net indebtedness of the taxing unit should not be increased beyond the limits prescribed in the amendment, except with the approval of its voters. Gill v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 160</cite>,

                            the plant without resort to funds raised by taxation, does not create a "debt" of the municipality within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section, which prohibits the contracting of a debt by a municipality in any fiscal
                            year in excess of two-thirds of the amount by which its debt was decreased during the prior fiscal year. Williamson v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 96</cite>, 195 S.E. 90 (1938).

                            Authority to Issue Bonds Implies Authority to Levy Taxes for Payment of Bonds. - The exercise by a municipal corporation of the power to pledge its credit is an incipient step in the exercise of the power of taxation, and authority given to a municipality
                            to issue bonds necessarily involves the power to levy taxes for the payment of interest on said bonds and the payment of said bonds at maturity. Wilson v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 14</cite>,

                            The acquisition of land for a municipal airport from surplus funds was not beyond the power of the city and it in no way offended this section. Goswick v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 687</cite>, 191 S.E.

                            Where appropriations were made by two cities and county to airport authority out of funds not derived from ad volorem taxes, and the funds were free from other specified purpose or legal commitment, no question of credit in violation of this section was

                            Agreement to Contribute Nontax Revenue for Airport. - Even though an agreement between a city and a county and the federal government might be construed to obligate the city and county to spend only nontax revenue for the maintenance and operation of
                            an airport, county and city were without authority to incur such debt without the approval of the voters. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967).

                            A contract between a county and one of its municipalities to contribute funds for the construction and operation of an airport, without submitting the question to a vote, was invalid, even if the contribution of funds for the construction of the airport
                            was made from nontax revenue, where the contract was indivisible and the pledging of future operating funds was unlimited, and, even if limited to nontax revenue, would be unconstitutional. Yokley v. Clark,

                            Where a city sells land used for recreation purposes and turns the proceeds of the sale over to its park and recreation commission, the action is not a pledging of its faith and credit. Hall v. Redd, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 622</cite>,

                            Vote on Distinct Debts in One Ballot Box. - An issue of municipal bonds, when approved by the voters, under the authority of a statute passed according to the constitutional requirements, is not invalid because there were several distinct debts provided
                            and voted for in one ballot box. Smith v. Town of Belhaven, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 156</cite>, 63 S.E. 610 (1909).

                            Submission of Question of Issuance of County Bonds and City Bonds. - In a bond election in a county and a city situate therein, the submission to the voters of the question of the issuance of county bonds in a stipulated sum and city bonds in a stipulated
                            sum for the purpose of providing funds for erecting and equipping public libraries for the city and for the county, and the imposition of a tax within the city for the payment of the city bonds and a tax in the entire county,
                            including the city, for the payment of the county, as a single question, is the submission of but a single proposition so related and united as to form a rounded whole and does not violate this section. Jamison v. City of Charlotte,

                            Endorsement of Township Bonds by County. - Where townships are permitted to call an election for the purpose of voting upon the issuance of township bonds for the roads of the township, the proceeds to be turned over to the sole management and control
                            of the township commissioners, with further provision that the county endorse the bonds upon being satisfied of the validity of the issuance, the endorsement by the county of the township bonds is a loan of the credit of the

                            the expenses incident thereto are paid out of its surplus profits, the proposition is not one that requires the approval of the voters. Holmes v. City of Fayetteville, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 740</cite>,

                        Statute Authorizing County to Impose Tax. - Where a statute authorizes a county to impose a tax for necessary expenses, it is a delegation of the power to be exercised by the county as an agency for the State for the convenience of local administration,
                        and the statute is not void in failing to state the special object to which it is to be applied, nor is the tax itself invalid if this constitutional requirement has been observed by the county authority in the imposition of the
                        special tax. Norfolk S.R.R. v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 320</cite>, 121 S.E. 534 (1924), decided under former Art. V,

                        Transfer of Funds from Bond Issue from One Project to Another. - While a municipality has a limited authority, under certain conditions, to transfer or allocate funds from one project to another included within the general purpose for which bonds are
                        authorized, the transfer must be to a project included in the general purpose as stated in the bond resolution, and the funds may be diverted to the proposed purposes only in the event that the municipality finds in good faith
                        that conditions have so changed since the bonds were authorized that proceeds therefrom are no longer needed for the original purpose. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>,

                        or temporary changes consistent with the general purpose of the legislative act should be interpreted as unlawful diversions of public funds. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>,

                    Notwithstanding Section 4 of this Article, the General Assembly may enact general laws authorizing any county, city, or town to define territorial areas in the county, city, or town and borrow money to be used to finance public improvements associated
                    with private development projects within the territorial areas, as provided in this section. The General Assembly shall set forth by statute the method for determining the size of the territorial area and the issuing unit. This method
                    is conclusive. When a territorial area is defined pursuant to this section, the county shall determine the current assessed value of taxable real and personal property in the territorial area. Thereafter, property in the territorial
                    area continues to be subject to taxation to the same extent and in like manner as property not in the territorial area, but the net proceeds of taxes levied on the excess, if any, of the assessed value of taxable real and personal
                    property in the territorial area at the time the taxes are levied over the assessed value of taxable real and personal property in the territorial area at the time the territorial area was defined may be set aside. The instruments
                    of indebtedness authorized by this section shall be secured by these set-aside proceeds. The General Assembly may authorize a county, city, or town issuing these instruments of indebtedness to pledge, as additional security, revenues
                    available to the issuing unit from sources other than the issuing unit's exercise of its taxing power. As long as no revenues are pledged other than the set-aside proceeds authorized by this section and the revenues authorized in the
                    preceding sentence, these instruments of indebtedness may be issued without approval by referendum. The county, city, or town may not pledge as security for these instruments of indebtedness any property tax revenues other than the
                    set-aside proceeds authorized in this section, or in any other manner pledge its full faith and credit as security for these instruments of indebtedness unless a vote of the people is held as required by and in compliance with the
                    requirements of Section 4 of this Article.

                <p>
                    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 of this Article, the General Assembly may enact general laws authorizing a county, city, or town that has defined a territorial area pursuant to this section to assess property within the territorial area at
                    a minimum value if agreed to by the owner of the property, which agreed minimum value shall be binding on the current owner and any future owners as long as the defined territorial area is in effect.

                        "Residence," within the purview of this provision, is synonymous with domicile, and as used in the North Carolina Constitution of 1970 continues to mean domicile. Hall v. Wake County Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 600</cite>,

                        Duration of Residence. - A person, in order to become a qualified elector in this State, must have come into the State a year before the election, or have been domiciled within it for 12 months after forming the purpose to remain, and the same intent
                        must be concurrent with the actual occupation of a domicile in the county in order to entitle him to the rights of an elector within its limits. People ex rel. Boyer v. Teague, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 576</cite>,

                        General Assembly Cannot Increase Length of Residence Requirement. - The General Assembly cannot in any way change the qualifications of voters in State, county, township, city or town elections; thus, an act which requires a longer residence in the county
                        than this section requires is unconstitutional. People ex rel. Van Bokkelen v. Canaday, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 198</cite> (1875).

                        Qualifications for Municipal Election. - Cities and towns, like counties and townships, are parts and parcels of the State, organized for the convenience of local self-government; and the qualifications of voters are the same. People ex rel. Van Bokkelen

                    <p>
                        Limitations on Voting Imposed by Municipality. - A provision in the charter of a municipality limiting the right of suffrage in municipal elections to owners of real property within the town is unconstitutional. Smith v. Town of Carolina Beach,

                    <p>
                        A provision in a town charter permitting nonresident freeholders to vote in all municipal elections is void because in conflict with this section. However, an election held under this provision is not void if it is shown that no persons not qualified
                        under the Constitution actually participated in the election. Wrenn v. Town of Kure Beach, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 292</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 492 (1952).

                    <p>
                        This constitutional provision applies primarily to an incoming person, who is not permitted to exercise political rights until after he has been in the State and the voting precinct for the prescribed periods. State ex rel. Owens v. Chaplin,

                    <p>
                        No Application to a Citizen of this State Who Is Temporarily Absent. - This constitutional provision is not designed to disfranchise a citizen of the State when he leaves his home and goes into another state or into another county of this State for temporary
                        purposes with the intention of retaining his home and of returning to it when the objects which call him away are attained. State ex rel. Owens v. Chaplin, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 705</cite>, 47 S.E.2d
                        12, petition for rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 797</cite>, 48 S.E.2d 37 (1948).

                    <p>
                        Where a voter was in the service of the federal government at Washington, D.C., but continued to pay poll tax and vote in Halifax County, and spent a part of each year at his home in Halifax, his constitutional residence remained unchanged in Halifax.

                    <p>
                        Protracted Residence Abroad. - A protracted residence abroad of one engaged in business and with no home in this State is not consistent with the idea of residence here. State ex rel. Hannon v. Grizzard, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 115</cite>                        (1883).

                        impact. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App. - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).

                        Voters made a sufficient preliminary showing that even if the General Assembly followed its rules, the process employed in enacting Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) was nevertheless unusual because sixty-one of the legislators who voted in favor of S.B. 824
                        had previously voted to enact a law thatwas struck down as motivated by a discriminatory intent; S.B. 824 was passed in a short timeframe by a lame-duck-Republican supermajority, which showed an intent to push through legislation.

                    the First Amendment. The Court held that a declaration of belief in God as a qualification of office was a violation of the "establishment of religion" by the State. "[N]either a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally
                    force a person 'to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.'"

                        "Guilty" Defined. - The word "guilty" connotes evil, intentional wrongdoing and refers to conscious and culpable acts; it does not necessarily mean or require criminal conviction or the finding of a jury. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>,
                        250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).

                    <p>
                        The definitions of "adjudged" and "guilty" are broad enough to encompass an adjudication by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite>,

                        Criminal Conviction Unnecessary for Disqualification. - Substitution in this section of the term "adjudged guilty" for the term "convicted" permits the General Assembly to prescribe proceedings in addition to criminal trials in which an adjudication of
                        guilt will result in disqualification from office. Pursuant to that authorization, the legislature enacted <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite>,
                        barring a judge from future judicial office when he has been removed by this court for willful misconduct in office. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99

                        Adjudication of "Willful Misconduct in Office" Equivalent to "Malpractice in Any Office" for Removal Purposes. - An adjudication of "willful misconduct in office" by the Supreme Court in a proceeding instituted by the Judicial Standards Commission in
                        which the judge or justice involved has been accorded due process of law and his guilt established by "clear and convincing evidence" is equivalent to an adjudication of guilt of "malpractice in any office" as used in this section.
                        Therefore, the legislature acted within its power when it made disqualification from judicial office a consequence of removal for willful misconduct under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite>.

                        such judgment. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 685</cite> (1880), decided under former Art. VI,

                        Purpose. - The manifest intent of this section is to prevent double office holding, that is, that offices and places of public trust should not accumulate in any single person, and the superadded words of "places of trust or profit" were put in to avoid
                        evasion in giving too technical a meaning to the preceding words. Doyle v. Aldermen of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 133</cite> (1883), approved in Groves v. Barden, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 8</cite>,

                        Dual Candidacy. - The trial court properly refused to declare <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a10s163-106" target="_blank">G.S. 163-106</a></cite> and 163-323 unconstitutional although, taken together,
                        they created a "loophole" which allowed a candidate to run for a superior court seat and another office on the same election day, regardless of the filing periods; the provisions do not create a benefit to lawyers while denying
                        non-lawyers the equal protection of the law, they do not remove the election process from the hands of the voters, and they do not allow dual officeholding in violation of this section although they do allow dual candidacy. Comer

                        v. County of Buncombe, 663 F. Supp. 1003 (W.D.N.C. 1987).

                    <p>
                        Where the office which a judge proposed to accept carried with it some of the attributes of sovereignty, and perforce invested him with governmental authority, he would be holding an office or place of trust or profit under the United States, or a department
                        thereof, within the meaning of this section. In re Advisory Opinion, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 772</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 217 (1946).

                    <p>
                        Acceptance of Second Office Vacates First Office. - Where one holding an "office or place of profit" accepts another such office or position in contravention of this section, the first is vacated eo instanti, and any further acts done by him in connection
                        with the first office are without color, and cannot be de facto. Whitehead v. Pittman, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 89</cite>, 80 S.E. 976 (1914).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The acceptance of a second office by one holding a public office operates ipso facto to vacate the first. While the officer has a right to elect which he will retain, his election is deemed to have been made when he accepts and qualifies for the second.
                        Thus, the acceptance of the second office is of itself a resignation of the first. State ex rel. Barnhill v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 493</cite>, 29 S.E. 720 (1898); Whitehead v. Pittman,
                        <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 89</cite>, 80 S.E. 976 (1914).

                    <p>
                        The acceptance of a second office which is forbidden or incompatible with the office already held operates ipso facto to vacate the first. In re Yelton, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 845</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 567 (1944); In re Advisory
                        Opinion, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 772</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 217 (1946).

                    <p>
                        Where a man accepts an office under the State, he vacates another held under the same sovereignty. State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 377</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 49 (1968).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Date of Acceptance Is Date of Vacancy. - Where a vacancy in a public office occurs by virtue of the constitutional provision against double office holding, such vacancy occurs as of the date of the acceptance of the second office, unaffected by the fact
                        that the person accepting the second office continues to discharge the duties of the office in good faith, since ignorance of the law excuses no man. State ex rel. Atkins v. Fortner, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 264</cite>,
                        72 S.E.2d 594 (1952).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unless First Office Is a Federal Office. - The constitutional inhibition against double office holding is enforced in alternative ways, depending on whether the first office is a State or a federal office. Where one holding a first office under the State
                        violates this section by accepting a second office under either the State or the United States without surrendering the first office, he automatically and instantly vacates the first office, and he does not thereafter act as either
                        a de jure or a de facto officer in performing functions of the first office, because he has neither right nor color of right to it. Where one holding a first office under the United States violates the section by accepting a second
                        office under the State without surrendering the first office, his attempt to qualify for the second office is absolutely void, and he does not act as either a de jure or a de facto officer in performing the functions of the second
                        office, because he has neither right nor color of right to it. Edwards v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 345</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 170 (1952).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where clerk of county recorder's court accepted the office of justice of the peace without surrendering the first office, he automatically and instantly vacated the first office, and he did not thereafter act as either a de jure or a de facto officer
                        in performing functions of the first office, because he had neither right nor color of right to it. State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 377</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 49 (1968).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The jurisdiction of a judge of a municipal recorder's court to impose sentence could not be successfully attacked on the ground that at the time the recorder was appointed as such he was mayor of the municipality and that he therefore held two offices
                        in contravention of this section, since even if it was granted that the statute permitting a mayor to be appointed recorder conferred upon the mayor when chosen recorder other than ex officio duties, the acceptance of the office
                        of recorder would vacate the office of mayor, but would not affect the office of recorder. In re Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 735</cite>, 194 S.E. 499 (1938).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A statute providing that the incumbent of one public office should also fill another public office is unconstitutional as violating this section, and cannot be upheld as merely affording a choice between the offices so that the acceptance of the second
                        office would ipso facto vacate the first, since incumbency in the first is essential to incumbency in the second. State ex rel. Brigman v. Baley, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 119</cite>, 195 S.E. 617 (1938).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Statute which creates no new office and appoints no additional officer, but merely attaches new duties to offices already existing, to be performed by the incumbents therein, does not violate this section. State ex rel. Brigman v. Baley,
                        <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 119</cite>, 195 S.E. 617 (1938).

                        Public-Local Laws of 1931, c. 341, providing that the chairmen of certain county boards of Madison County should elect a tax manager for the county, merely imposed additional duties ex officio upon the said chairmen, and did not provide that any one of
                        them should hold two public offices in violation of this section. Freeman v. Board of County Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 209</cite>, 7 S.E.2d 354 (1940).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Delegation of Duties of City Manager. - A statute which places the affairs of a municipal corporation in the hands of a city council and a city manager and provides that in the event of a vacancy in the office of city manager, by sickness or otherwise,
                        the council may delegate the duties of this office to one of its members, to be performed ex officio as mere auxiliary duties, with such compensation as the council may determine, but with no salary as a member of the council,
                        did not contravene this section. State ex rel. Grimes v. Holmes, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 293</cite>, 176 S.E. 746 (1934).

                        de facto nor a de jure commissioner. Vance S. Harrington &amp; Co. v. Renner, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 321</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 838 (1952).

                        Municipal corporations are instrumentalities of the State for the administration of local government. They are created by the General Assembly under the general authority conferred by this section. They have such powers as are expressly conferred by statute
                        and those necessarily implied therefrom. Town of Grimesland v. City of Wash., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 117</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 794 (1951).

                        A municipal corporation, city or town, is an agency created by the State to assist in the civil government of a designated territory. Its charter is the legislative description of the power to be exercised. In re Indian Hills,

                        This section gives the General Assembly the authority to provide for the organization and government of counties, including the granting of such powers and duties to the counties as it deems advisable. As an agent of the State, a county has no inherent
                        power, but may exercise only those powers prescribed by statute and those necessarily implied by law. In re Easement of Right of Way, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 303, 368 S.E.2d 639 (1988).

                        Municipal Corporations Derive their Powers Almost Solely from Legislative Enactment. - Municipal corporations derive their powers almost solely from legislative enactment under this section, and are subject to statutory restrictions and regulations of
                        their taxing power. Purser v. Ledbetter, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 1</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 702 (1946).

                        Power to Tax. - This section seems to give a general control to the legislature on the subject of municipal corporations, and the legislature may, under it, restrict the power of taxation by corporations as it may think proper, due regard being had to
                        other parts of the Constitution. Pullen v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. 451</cite> (1873).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A sovereign state, as one of its inherent attributes, has the power of taxation, which must be exercised by its legislative branch. The county is not a sovereign and hence does not have the inherent power to levy taxes. A county must derive its taxing
                        power from the State Constitution or from the State's legislative enactments. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).

                    <p>
                        The counties have no inherent taxing power. A county derives its power to tax from the legislature and cannot complain that the enabling legislation is lacking in breadth. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 66</cite>,

                        fees for future services; because the legislature alone controlled the extension of municipal authority, the ordinances on their face exceeded the powers delegated to the town, thus overstepping its rightful authority. Quality

                    In each county a Sheriff shall be elected by the qualified voters thereof at the same time and places as members of the General Assembly are elected and shall hold his office for a period of four years, subject to removal for cause as provided by law.
                    No person is eligible to serve as Sheriff if that person has been convicted of a felony against this State, the United States, or another state, whether or not that person has been restored to the rights of citizenship in the manner
                    prescribed by law. Convicted of a felony includes the entry of a plea of guilty; a verdict or finding of guilt by a jury, judge, magistrate, or other adjudicating body, tribunal, or official, either civilian or military; or a plea
                    of no contest, nolo contendere, or the equivalent.

        Deputy Sheriffs.
       </b> - While the office of sheriff is provided for by this section, the right of the sheriff to appoint deputies is a common-law right; deputies appointed by the sheriff are public officers, but their duties and authority
                        relate only to ministerial duties imposed by law upon the sheriff, in the performance of which they act for the sheriff in his name and right. Gowens v. Alamance County, 3 S.E.2d 339 (1939), decided under former Art. IV,

                        In light of the distinct demarcation between county government and the office of the sheriff, a sheriff's office is not a program or department of a county, and a deputy sheriff or employee of a sheriff's office is not a county employee. Young v. Bailey,

                        Discharge of Sheriff's Employees Based Upon Political Matters. - Deputy sheriff was discharged based upon political conduct without violating free speech rights. Dismissal of another employee's claim for violation of the employee's rights to free speech
                        was appropriate because the sheriff produced evidence that the employee was discharged for failure to comply with the sheriff's department rules and policies, and the employee failed to produce specific evidence that the employee's
                        discharge was politically motivated. McLaughlin v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 771 S.E.2d 570 (2015), dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 284</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 835, 2015

                    <p>
                        Purpose of Section. - The purpose and effect of this section is to enable the State to control, modify or repeal corporate powers, thus avoiding the effect of the doctrine announced in Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518,
                        4 L. Ed. 629 (1819); Elizabeth City Water &amp; Power Co. v. City of Elizabeth City, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 278</cite>, 124 S.E. 611 (1924). See also, Atlantic &amp; N.C.R.R. v. Dortch, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 663</cite>,
                        33 S.E. 1014 (1899).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Effect of Section. - Except for purposes of absolute repeal, which is retained throughout as essential to the proper exercise and enforcement of the police powers of government, and except, also, in the instances expressly designated, this section withdraws
                        from the General Assembly any and all power by special enactments to create, extend, alter, or amend the charter of all private business corporations, and all quasi-public corporations, such as railroads, incorporated turnpike
                        or toll roads, bridge companies, and the like, and also those corporations which while having at times and to some extent powers appertaining to government are in fact and in truth business corporations for the purpose principally
                        of promoting private interest. Watts v. Lenoir &amp; Blowing Rock, Tpk. Co., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 129</cite>, 106 S.E. 497 (1921).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only "Special Acts" are Prohibited. - This section only prohibits the enactment of a special act, and an act which relates to all municipal corporations of a county, including cities, towns, townships, and school districts, is not a special act within
                        its meaning and intent. Kornegay v. City of Goldsboro, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. 441</cite>, 105 S.E. 187 (1920).

                    <p>
                        Prohibition of Special Acts Applies Only to Private Corporations. - The prohibition contained in this section refers only to private or business corporations, and does not refer to public or quasi-public corporations acting as governmental agencies. Mills

                        The provisions of this section prohibiting the legislature from creating a corporation or extending, altering or amending its charter by special act has been held to apply only to private or business corporations; and where the legislature by special
                        act amending the charter of a city authorizes it to purchase electricity and resell it to its inhabitants and those within a three-mile zone of the city, the power to sell to such individuals and corporations does not detract from
                        the public service or destroy the public character of the municipality, and where the same power is given the city by general statute also, the exercise of the power thus conferred will not be enjoined. Holmes v. City of Fayetteville,

                        Dist. v. City of Lenoir, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 96</cite>, 105 S.E.2d 411 (1958).

                    <p>
                        Legislature May Create Corporation for Public Purpose. - The legislative power as to State and political and administrative subdivisions thereof is restrained only by the limitations imposed by the State Constitution and the Constitution of the United
                        States, and there is no constitutional limitation on the power of the General Assembly to create a corporation for a public purpose. Brumley v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 691</cite>, 36 S.E.2d
                        281, 162 A.L.R. 930 (1945).

                        Commission created as an agency of the State to provide port facilities for the commerce of the State in the public interest, and not for private gain, is a public corporation, and the legislature is not prohibited from creating such corporation by this
                        section, nor is the act creating it a special act within the meaning of this section, and the commission may lawfully exercise all powers conferred upon it in order to perform its duties as prescribed by the act. Webb v. Port Comm'n,
                        <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 663</cite>, 172 S.E. 377 (1934).

                    <p>
                        Right of Alteration a Part of Every Charter. - The provisions of this section, affecting the organization of corporations, and specifically providing that all such laws may be altered from time to time or repealed, enters into every charter taken out
                        or corporation formed thereunder, and any such corporation may not complain when a statutory repeal or amendment has been made, on the ground that it works a hardship on it or impairs the value of its property, unless vested rights
                        have been acquired by it which have been impaired or destroyed by the repealing or amendatory act complained of. State v. Cantwell, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 604</cite>, 55 S.E. 820 (1906); Yadkin River
                        Power Co. v. Whitney Co., <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 31</cite>, 63 S.E. 188 (1908), appeal dismissed, 214 U.S. 503, 29 S. Ct. 702, 53 L. Ed. 1061 (1909); Elizabeth City Water &amp; Power Co. v. City of Elizabeth City,
                        <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 278</cite>, 124 S.E. 611 (1924).

                    <p>
                        Power to Extinguish Corporations. - The General Assembly may, at its discretion, abolish municipal as well as other corporations, because they are all alike creatures of its will, and exist only at its pleasure. Ward v. Elizabeth City,
                        <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 1</cite>, 27 S.E. 993 (1897).

                    <p>
                        Effect of Dissolution. - Upon the dissolution or extinction of a corporation under this section for any cause, real property conveyed to it in fee does not revert to the original grantors or their heirs, and its personal property does not escheat to the
                        State; and this is so whether or not the duration of the corporation was limited by its charter or general statute. Wilson v. Leary, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 90</cite>, 26 S.E. 630 (1897), overruling

                        Where the legislature deprived board of township trustees of its existence as a municipal corporation, the right to sue and be sued were likewise extinguished, and hence it could not thereafter be a party to a suit. Wallace v. Board of Trustees,

                            Public School System Established. - The Constitution establishes the public school system, and the General Assembly provides for it, by its own taxing power, and by the taxing power of the counties, and the State Board of Education, by the aid of school
                            committees, manages it. It is to be a "system," it is to be "general," and it is to be "uniform." It is not to be subject to the caprices of localities, but every locality, yea, every child, is to have the same advantage and
                            be subject to the same rules and regulations. Lane v. Stanly, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 153</cite> (1871).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This section contemplates that the General Assembly shall provide a State system of public schools to the end that every child, without regard to the county in which such child resides, shall have an opportunity to attend a school in which standards set
                            up by the State are maintained and wherein tuition shall be free of charge. Marshburn v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 331</cite>, 186 S.E. 265 (1936); Constantian v. Anson County,
                            <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 221</cite>, 93 S.E.2d 163 (1956).

                        <p>
                            The provisions of this section and of N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s1">
         §
        </span> 15, with the activating statutes, embody mandates for the establishment of free public schools in North Carolina, the untrammeled privilege of education for all students, and the duty of the State to maintain
                            and guard that right, while guaranteeing equal opportunities to all students. Webster v. Perry, 512 F.2d 612 (4th Cir. 1975).

                        <p>
                            Construction. - Court sees no reason to define "may" in the context of N.C. Const. art. IX,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 2(2) to be mandatory, as the provision was not intended to provide any party with relief or protect public or private rights or interests; indeed, the purpose of the provision is to promote efficiency, as it gives
                            the General Assembly a mechanism to supplement the costs and financial administration of the education system that it is required to set up and maintain. Silver v. Halifax Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 855</cite>,
                            821 S.E.2d 755 (2018).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Meaning of "Uniform". - The requirement of this section that the public school system shall be uniform by legislative authority relates to the uniformity of the "system," and not to the uniformity of the class or kind of the "schools"; thus qualifying
                            the word "system," it is sufficiently complied with where, by statute or authorized regulation of the public school authorities, provision is made for establishment of schools of like kind throughout all sections of the State
                            and available to all of the school population of the territories contributing to their support. Board of Educ. v. Board of County Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 469</cite>, 93 S.E. 1001
                            (1917).

                        <p>
                            Intent. - By mandating equal opportunities for all students, the framers of the Constitution and the voters that adopted it were emphasizing that the days of "separate but equal" education in this State were over, and that the people of this State were
                            committed to providing all students with equal access to full participation in public schools, regardless of race or other classification. Britt v. North Carolina State Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Equal access to participation in the public school system is a fundamental right guaranteed by the State Constitution and protected by considerations of procedural due process. Sneed v. Greensboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 609</cite>,
                            264 S.E.2d 106 (1980).

                        <p>
                            The fundamental right that is guaranteed by the Constitution is equal access to public schools; that is, every child has a fundamental right to receive an education in public schools. Britt v. North Carolina State Bd. of Educ.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 282, 357 S.E.2d 432, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 790</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 71 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Alternative Education. - Considering longstanding precedent affording school officials discretion in administering student disciplinary codes and the state constitutional right to a sound basic education, school officials were required to articulate a
                            reason for denying a student access to alternative education during a long-term suspension. King v. Beaufort County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 368</cite>, 704 S.E.2d 259 (2010).

                            Does Not Preclude Creation of Nontraditional Schools. - N.C. Const., Art. IX,
                            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 2 merely requires that all North Carolina students have access to a sound basic education and does not preclude the creation of schools or other educational programs with attributes or funding options different from
                            those associated with traditional public schools. Sugar Creek Charter Sch., Inc. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 712 S.E.2d 730 (2011), dismissed and review denied, <cite class="nc_code">366 N.C. 227</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The right to education provided in the state constitution is a right to a sound basic education. An education that does not serve the purpose of preparing students to participate and compete in the society in which they live and work is devoid of substance
                            and is constitutionally inadequate. Leandro v. State, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 468 S.E.2d 543 (1996), aff'd and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 336</cite>, 488

                            Sound Basic Education. - Article I, Section 15 and Article IX, Section 2 of the North Carolina Constitution combine to guarantee every child of this state an opportunity to receive a sound basic education in our public schools. Leandro v. State,
                            <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 468 S.E.2d 543 (1996), aff'd and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 336</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 249, 1997 N.C. LEXIS 486 (1997).

                        <p>
                            For purposes of our Constitution, a sound basic education will provide the student with at least: (1) sufficient ability to read, write, and speak English and a sufficient knowledge of fundamental math and physical science to enable the student to function
                            in a complex and rapidly changing society; (2) sufficient fundamental knowledge of geography, history and basic economic and political systems to enable the student to make informed choices regarding personal issues or issues
                            that affect the community, state, and nation; (3) sufficient academic and vocational skills to enable the student to successfully engage in post-secondary education or vocational training; (4) and sufficient academic and social
                            skills to enable the student to compete on an equal basis with others in further formal education or gainful employment. Leandro v. State, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 468 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            In a trial of a dispute between county commissioners and a school board over the county commissioners' required school funding, it was error to instruct a jury that the North Carolina Constitution provided every child the right to a sound basic education
                            because the Constitution required the provision of the opportunity for a sound basic education. Union County Bd. of Educ. v. Union County Bd. of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite>                            274, 771 S.E.2d 590 (2015).

                        <p>
                            To the extent that a county, as an agency of the State, hinders the opportunity for children to receive a sound basic education, it is the State's constitutional burden to take corrective action. Silver v. Halifax Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 855</cite>, 821 S.E.2d 755 (2018).

                            State, not a board of county commissioners, is solely responsible for guarding and preserving the right of every child in North Carolina to receive a sound basic education pursuant to the North Carolina Constitution; acting together, N.C. Const. art.

                            Programs Proposed by Board of Education. - The General Assembly has not delegated to board of county commissioners the power to initiate and fund their own programs for the public schools; rather, county commissioners are delegated the power to fund only
                            those school-related programs proposed by the board of education. Hughey v. Cloninger, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 86</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 898 (1979).

                            Counties May Act as Agents of State. - A county is an administrative unit of the State in our statewide public school system, and a statute requiring a county to maintain at least a six-months (now nine-months) school term in each of its school districts
                            and to provide the necessary funds therefor by taxation or otherwise is valid. Evans v. Mecklenburg County, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 560</cite>, 172 S.E. 323 (1934).

                            for the personal use of such students does not violate the mandate of subsection (1) of this section. Nor is there any constitutional impediment to the charging of modest, reasonable fees by individual school boards to support

                            Trial court erred in declaring unconstitutional the Opportunity Scholarship Program because the legislation did not create an alternate system of publicly funded private schools legislation but provided modest scholarships to lower-income students for
                            use at nonpublic schools of their choice; the uniformity clause of the constitution applies exclusively to the public school system and does not prohibit the General Assembly from funding educational initiatives outside of

                        General Assembly's delegation to the Rules Review Commission of the authority to review and approve State Board of Education rules does not contravene the Board's general rulemaking authority; the General Assembly has delegated review and approval authority

                        Court of Appeals properly reversed and remanded the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the State Board of Education regarding procedures for the Board's proposed rules and regulations because the General Assembly was constitutionally authorized
                        to delegate authority to the Rules Review Commission to review and approve the State Board of Education's proposed rules, the APA provided a comprehensive statutory scheme for procedures and due process for individuals affected

                        with the Superintendent's authority as the secretary and chief administrative officer of the Board and as an "elective officer" whose duties were prescribed by law, and the Board's authority to "supervise and administer" the public
                        school system, while the newly enacted statutory language provided that the Superintendent would direct and control all matters relating to the direct supervision and administration of the school system. N.C. State Bd. of Educ.

                        State May Regulate Private Schools. - The State has the power and authority to establish minimum standards for, and to regulate in a reasonable manner, private schools giving instruction to children of compulsory school age. This is necessarily true because
                        such schools affect the public school system. In this connection it has authority, among other things, to inspect, supervise, and examine such schools and their teachers and pupils, and to require that all children of proper age
                        attend some school, that teachers be of good moral character and patriotic disposition, that certain studies plainly essential to good citizenship be taught, and that nothing be taught that is manifestly inimical to the public
                        welfare. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 337</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 444 (1960), decided under former Art. IX,

                        As Exercise of Police Power. - The constitutional authority of the State Board of Education to make regulations for and supervise and administer schools is confined to public schools and activities substantially affecting public schools and the public
                        school system. It may have and exert only such authority in the supervision and control of private schools and their agents and representatives as is conferred by the General Assembly in the proper exercise of the police power
                        of the State. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 337</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 444 (1960), decided under former Art. IX,

                        Constitution of 1868 Authorized Regulations on Certification of Teachers. - Article IX,

    §
   </span> 9, Const. 1868, was designed to make, and did make, the powers conferred upon the State Board of Education subject to limitation and revision by acts of the General Assembly. That Constitution, itself, conferred upon
                        the State Board of Education the enumerated powers to regulate the salaries and qualifications of teachers and to make needful rules and regulations in relation to this and other aspects of the administration of the public school
                        system. In the silence of the General Assembly, the authority of the State Board to promulgate and administer further regulations concerning the certification of teachers in the public schools was limited only by other provisions

                        Trial Court Could Not Command State Officials to Pay Money from State Treasury. - Although the State of North Carolina violated a provision in the North Carolina Constitution when it moved money otherwise destined for county schools to a separate state
                        fund to pay for county jail programs, a trial court could not command state officials to pay money from the State of North Carolina's treasury to satisfy the court judgment against the State, because the Separation of Powers Clause
                        in the Constitution prevented the courts from stepping into the shoes of the other branches of government and assuming their constitutional duties. Richmond Cty.

                        The term "penal laws," as used in the context of this section, means laws that impose a monetary payment for their violation. The payment is punitive rather than remedial in nature and is intended to penalize the wrongdoer rather than to compensate a
                        particular party. Mussallam v. Mussallam, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 504</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 364, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 116</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 915 (1988).

                        When Prescribed as Punishment for Public Wrongs. - Where fines and penalties are prescribed as a punishment for a violation of public wrongs, i.e., crimes, and such penalties or fines are to be recovered by public authority, the disposition of such recovered
                        fines or penalties comes within the constitutional provision under consideration, and they may not be turned away from the prescribed constitutional course. Shore v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 628</cite>,

                        This section appropriates all fines for violation of the criminal laws of the State for establishing and maintaining free public schools in the several counties, whether the fines are for violation of town ordinances made misdemeanors by statute or other
                        criminal statutes. Board of Educ. v. Town of Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 689</cite>, 36 S.E. 158, modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 8</cite>, 37 S.E. 72 (1900).

                        Municipal Clerk Not Entitled to Fees from Fines. - By provision of this section, the clear proceeds of fines collected by the clerk of a municipal court belong to the county school fund, and the clerk is not entitled to retain a percentage thereof as
                        his fees, regardless of the provisions of public-local laws relating to his compensation. County Bd. of Educ. v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 636</cite>, 197 S.E. 191 (1938).

                        Moneys Voluntarily Paid for Violation of City Ordinances Belong to School Fund. - Moneys voluntarily paid by motorists to a city upon citations for violations of a city overtime parking ordinance constitute a penalty or fine collected for breach of a
                        state penal law and should be used exclusively for maintaining free public schools in the county pursuant to this section, since violation of a city ordinance is also a violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia01s14-4" target="_blank">G.S. 14-4</a></cite>                        which makes the violation of a local ordinance a misdemeanor.

                        Two Funds for Public Schools. - The provisions of this section relating to the clear proceeds from penalties, forfeitures and fines identify two distinct funds for the public schools. These are (1) the clear proceeds of all penalties and forfeitures in
                        all cases, regardless of their nature, so long as they accrue to the state, and (2) the clear proceeds of all fines collected for any breach of the criminal laws. Mussallam v. Mussallam, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 504</cite>,

                        This section establishes two funds for public schools: (1) the clear proceeds of all penalties and forfeitures in all cases, regardless of their nature, so long as they accrue to the state; and (2) the clear proceeds of all fines collected for any breach
                        of the criminal laws. United States v. Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of Educ., 902 F.2d 267 (4th Cir. 1990).

                        Bond Proceeds Held Payable to Board of Education. - In custody case in which wife sought to regain custody of child who had been removed outside the country, bond set by superior court judge was to ensure husband's appearance, as the punishment for his
                        failure to so appear would be immediate forfeiture of the bond, and since the terms of the bond specifically made its proceeds payable to the State of North Carolina should it be forfeited, such bond was penal in nature and accrued
                        to the Board of Education. Mussallam v. Mussallam, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 504</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 364, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 116</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 915 (1988).

                        The 1985 amendment to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115C.html#t115CsVIIa31s115C-437" target="_blank">G.S. 115C-437</a></cite>, defining "clear proceeds," could only be effective as to monies collected because of
                        traffic violations occurring on and after July 17, 1985. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Disposition of Parking Fines. - In the situation of parking fines, the costs of collection often surpass the amounts collected, the intent of the municipality in passing these ordinances being the regulation of traffic rather than the production of revenue.
                        Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1989).

                    <p>
                        While it is important that the needs of school children be met, and met generously, it is also important that a municipality feel free to enact ordinances imposing small fines for overtime parking violations without being economically penalized, if indeed
                        the municipality realizes no revenue from enforcement of these ordinances. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>,
                        336 S.E.2d 59 (1989).

                    <p>
                        Although defining costs of collection is a legislative function, the North Carolina General Assembly has not seen fit to provide municipalities with a formula for determining "clear proceeds" of fines realized from traffic violations. Lacking guidance
                        on the subject, the court would be compelled to resort to a less precise measure in order to allow municipalities to retain the costs of collecting overtime parking fines. Cauble v. City of Asheville,
                        <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1989).

                        The money penalty collected by a city from a motorist who violates its ordinance prohibiting overtime parking constitutes a penalty or fine collected for the breach of a state penal law, even if the motorist has not been convicted of violating
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia01s14-4" target="_blank">G.S. 14-4</a></cite>. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1985).

                    <p>
                        The "clear proceeds" of a forfeiture are defined as the amount of the forfeit less the cost of collection, meaning thereby the citations and process against the bondsman usually in the practice. Hightower v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 491</cite>,
                        57 S.E.2d 763 (1950).

                    <p>
                        The term "clear proceeds," as used in this section, is synonymous with "net proceeds." Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>,

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The words "clear proceeds" in this section have been construed to mean the total amount of the fine, penalty, or forfeiture, less only the cost of collection, which, for a bail bond, is the cost of citing and issuing process against the bondsman in the
                        usual manner. In re Dunlap, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 310 S.E.2d 415 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The costs of collection of a fine will be deducted to determine clear proceeds. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>,

                    <p>

        Exempt Funds on Hand May Not Exceed Constitutional Amount.
       </b> - A judgment debtor may claim his exemption as against successive executions, but may not have exempt funds in his possession at any one time in excess of his exemption. Stated another way, a judgment debtor is privileged
                        to make successive claims for his exemption, but may not hold free from execution at any one time an amount in excess of his exemption. New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 196 F. Supp. 780 (M.D.N.C. 1961), rev'd on other grounds,
                        301 F.2d 839 (4th Cir. 1962).

                        and statutory provisions both contemplate the possibility that changes in the debtor's residency or other changing circumstances may warrant subsequent modification of the debtor's right to constitutional or statutory exemptions.
                        First Union Nat'l Bank v. Rolfe, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 85, 367 S.E.2d 367 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Residency. - Irrespective of defendant's resident status previously, the trial court correctly determined defendant's residency based upon the evidence at the 1987 hearing. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Rolfe, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                        85, 367 S.E.2d 367 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Where the only evidence supporting defendant's contention of residency was her statement that she "hoped" to return to this state as soon as her sister's estate in Ireland was settled, this general declaration did not of itself defeat the trial court's
                        findings of nonresidency, in light of the other facts of the case, especially the undisputed evidence that defendant had moved to Ireland (her place of citizenship) at least one year previously, had no dwelling in this state, and
                        offered no definite plan to return. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Rolfe, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 85, 367 S.E.2d 367 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Time for Claiming Exemption. - It is only when property is about to be subjected to the payment of a debt by final process that the last opportunity is left to the defendant to claim his exemption. At any time before this stage of the proceeding is reached,
                        he may make his demand and become entitled to an allotment of the exemption. Chemical Co. v. Sloan, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 122</cite>, 48 S.E. 577 (1904).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The defendant may demand his exemption when a warrant of attachment is levied on his property and it is taken out of his possession, or he may wait until the final process is issued and the property is about to be appropriated by sale to the satisfaction
                        of the same. Chemical Co. v. Sloan, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 122</cite>, 48 S.E. 577 (1904).

                    <p>
                        A debtor may legally demand his personal property exemption at any time and up to the last moment before the appropriation thereof by the court, and the order of court directing a payment of the money derived from the sale of such property is final process
                        within the meaning of the Constitution, giving the creditor such right until execution or other final process. Befarrah v. Spell, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 231</cite>, 100 S.E. 321 (1919); Crow v. Morgan,

                        Debtor May Voluntarily Bargain Away Exemption Right. - In cases of foreclosure of mortgages or of taking possession of collateral after default, no right to possession of property otherwise exempt remains in the debtor, who has voluntarily bargained it
                        away. Montford v. Grohman, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 245 S.E.2d 219, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 551</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 727 (1978).

                        Legislature Has Not Prevented Debtor from Transferring Interest in Property to Another. - The legislature has seen fit to surround the family home with certain protections against the demands of urgent creditors to put it beyond the reach of those financial
                        misfortunes which even the most prudent and sagacious cannot always avoid. It has not seen fit to prevent a debtor from "selling" or otherwise transferring an interest in that property to another, thereby giving the other priority
                        of right to possession of the collateral. The constitutional exemption operates against general creditors so as to allow the debtor to retain his most valued $500.00 of property in the face of their executions. It does not operate
                        so as to hinder secured creditors from realizing on the terms of their bargain. Montford v. Grohman, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 245 S.E.2d 219, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 551</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Security Interest Has Replaced Chattel Mortgage as Protection of Creditor. - Before the enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, a debtor could subject his personal property to a chattel mortgage, and if he did so, the property was liable for the mortgage
                        debt first and the debtor's exemption was allotted only in the amount of the surplus. An Article 9 security interest by the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code replaces the chattel mortgage as a method of protecting the creditor.
                        Montford v. Grohman, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 245 S.E.2d 219, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 551</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 727 (1978).

                        Debtor divested herself of right to possession of personal property by terms of consumer loan contract with her creditor whereby the creditor obtained a security interest in all of her personal property, including her household furnishings. When the debtor
                        defaulted, the creditor had an immediate right to possess all articles in which she had given a security interest. However, this right must be distinguished from any interest which a creditor might seek under an executory waiver
                        of the right to exemption. It has long been held that a debtor cannot be bound by any agreement to waive his exemption in case of levy upon his property. Montford v. Grohman, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                        733, 245 S.E.2d 219, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 551</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 727 (1978).

                        the party to asset the exemption before judgment would enable him to obtain judgment in instances in which, if a balance were struck, nothing would be due him. Edgerton v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 300</cite>,

                        Where plaintiff moved that the judgment rendered against him in this cause on defendant's counterclaim should be offset by a judgment subsequently obtained by plaintiff against defendant in a separate action, contending that defendant was insolvent, and
                        defendant demanded that the judgment rendered in his favor upon the counterclaim in the cause be allowed to him as his personal property exemption, it was held that to allow offset would amount to "final process" within the meaning
                        of this section, and defendant's demand that the judgment in his favor on the counterclaim be allowed him as his personal property exemption precluded plaintiff's right of offset. Edgerton v. Johnson,

                            Homestead and Personal Property Exemptions Distinguished. - The homestead exemption is permanent unless there is a reallotment by reason of an increase in value. But the personal property exemption is to be reassigned whenever, at subsequent dates, executions
                            are levied. The reason is that the realty is fixed and stable, whereas the articles of personal property may be increased or diminished in quantity between the levy of executions. Gardner v. McConnaughey,

                        General Policy of Section. - This section is intended to emancipate married women and place them, so far as property rights are concerned, on a par with men and femmes sole. McLeod v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 451</cite>,
                        30 S.E. 129 (1898).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no "beneficent provision of the Constitution" which throws additional shackles around women in the management of their separate property. This provision of the Constitution is in exactly the opposite direction, in accordance with the free spirit
                        of the age and with the universal trend of legislation the world over. Its purpose is not to further assimilate married women to the condition of infants, but to make free women of them, to emancipate them from most of the restrictions
                        formerly existing. Strouse v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 349</cite>, 18 S.E. 323 (1893).

                        The historical context of this Article makes clear that wives were simply accorded rights in their property similar to those rights husbands already enjoyed in their own property.

                        Purpose to Give Wives Same Rights as Husbands. - The historical context of this Article makes clear that wives were simply accorded rights in their property similar to those rights husbands already enjoyed in their own property. Armstrong v. Armstrong,

                    <p>
                        Section Subject to Limitation Prescribed by General Assembly. - Whatever the remedial purpose of this section, it is by its own terms subject to limitations prescribed by the General Assembly, including any statutory classification and distribution of
                        property under the Equitable Distribution Act. Under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-20ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 50-20(b)</a></cite> of that Act, military retirement pay
                        is treated no differently, whether its recipient is male or female. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 354 S.E.2d 350 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Common-Law Rule Changed. - The common-law rule giving to the husband the actual or potential ownership of the separate choses in action belonging to his wife by reducing them into possession is now changed by this section giving to the wife the sole ownership
                        of her separate estate. Turlington v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 283</cite>, 119 S.E. 366 (1923).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By virtue of this section and other provisions, the relation which married women formerly sustained to their husbands has been materially modified. Unity of person in the strict common-law sense no longer exists, and many of the common-law disabilities
                        have been removed. Not only may they contract with each other; a married woman may now sue her husband in contract or in tort. Dorsett v. Dorsett, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 354</cite>, 111 S.E. 541,
                        23 A.L.R. 15 (1922); Roberts v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 566</cite>, 118 S.E. 9, 29 A.L.R. 1479 (1923); Etheredge v. Cochran, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 681</cite>, 146 S.E. 711 (1929); Shirley v. Ayers,

                    <p>
                        This section completely abolished the general doctrine of the common law that as to property husband and wife are in legal contemplation but one person, and that the husband is that one, and made very material and far-reaching changes as to the rights
                        respectively of husband and wife in respect to the wife's property, both real and personal, and enlarged the wife's power in respect to and control over her property. Dudley v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 572</cite>,
                        126 S.E.2d 590 (1962), commented on in 91 N.C.L. Rev. 311 (1963).

                    <p>
                        Purpose of 1964 Amendment. - The 1964 amendment to this section was enacted to abrogate the effect of the decision in Dudley v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 572</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 590 (1962) and to make the rights of
                        husbands and wives the same in each other's separate property. Fullam v. Brock, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 145</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 737 (1967).

                        Statutes allowing husband to dissent from wife's will violated section prior to 1964 amendment. Dudley v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 572</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 590 (1962), commented on in 41 N.C.L. Rev. 311 (1963); Fullam

                    <p>
                        Wife Could Bar Husband's Curtesy by Devising Property. - By marriage, before the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, the husband acquired no vested rights in the lands of his wife before a child was born capable of inheriting; and when the first child
                        of the marriage was born after the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, which gave a married woman the power, among other things, of disposing, by will, of her property acquired before marriage, she could accordingly dispose of
                        it by will and deprive her husband of his interest therein as tenant by the curtesy. Richardson v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 549</cite>, 64 S.E. 510 (1909).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the Constitution of 1868 there was no curtesy after the death of the wife in property which she had devised. Tiddy v. Graves, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 502</cite>, 37 S.E. 513 (1900); Dudley v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 572</cite>,

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The common-law estate of the husband as tenant by the curtesy initiate in the lands of his wife was abolished by Art. X,

                        Vested curtesy rights of husband at adoption of the Constitution of 1868 were not impaired. Richardson v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 549</cite>, 64 S.E. 510 (1909).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Amendment of 1964 Restored Husband's Right to Dissent. - The effect of the adoption by the voters of the 1964 amendment to this section was to restore, subject to the qualifications set forth in Session Laws 1963, c. 1209, the right of the husband to
                        dissent from the will of his wife. Fullam v. Brock, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 145</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 737 (1967).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dissent Could Be Based on Anticipatory Legislation Prior to Amendment. - Where, at the time of his wife's death in 1965, the amendment to this section authorizing the legislature to empower a husband to dissent from his wife's will had been certified
                        but the legislation reenacting former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.030.html#t30a01s30-1" target="_blank">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, 30-2, and 30-3 had not become effective, the husband had a
                        right to dissent from his wife's will based on anticipatory provisions of Session Laws 1963, c. 1209, which directed the submission of the constitutional amendment, and which provided that the word "spouse" should apply to both
                        husband and wife in certain statutes. Fullam v. Brock, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 145</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 737 (1967).

                    <p>
                        Legislative Control Over Capacity to Make Will. - This section, conferring upon married women the right to make a will, etc., was designed chiefly to remove the common-law restriction on married women in this respect, and was not intended to free such
                        right from every and all legislative regulation. Flanner v. Flanner, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 126</cite>, 75 S.E. 936 (1912).

                        Devise of Equitable Separate Estate. - A married woman may devise her equitable separate estate, in the absence of contrary provisions in the instrument creating it, where the trustee is a passive trustee; and, whether the trust be passive or active,
                        where the trust is to terminate with her life, and the estate to become absolute thereafter. Freeman v. Lide, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 434</cite>, 97 S.E. 402 (1918).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Provisions of Instrument Creating Estate Still Control. - Married women have no greater estates, by operation of this section of the Constitution, than those conveyed by the terms of the deed under which they derive title; nor are the properties and incidents
                        belonging to estates changed by that instrument. Long v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 329</cite> (1882).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Constitution imposes no limitation upon the right of a grantor or devisor to restrict or enlarge, by the terms of the instrument through which title passes, married woman's jus disponendi. Kirby v. Boyette, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 244</cite>,
                        24 S.E. 18 (1896).

                    <p>
                        Marriage Does Not Sever Unity of Title and Possession Under Joint Tenancy. - Where a deed of bargain and sale conveys a joint tenancy in the grantees with right of survivorship, the subsequent marriage of one of the grantees does not sever the unity of
                        title and possession. Vettori v. Fay, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 481</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 810 (1964).

                    <p>
                        Estates by entireties are not changed or affected by this section. Moore v. Shore, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 446</cite>, 181 S.E. 275 (1935), citing Bank of Greenville v. Gornto, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 341</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Lien Against Land Held by Entireties. - Estates by entireties as between husband and wife still exist in North Carolina, but where there is a judgment upon a joint contract against husband and wife, a lien thereunder is created against lands held by them
                        in entireties, and execution may be issued against them. Martin v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 473</cite>, 122 S.E. 180 (1924).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Conveyance of Land Held by Entireties. - The husband has the right, during coverture, to deal with the possession of land held by him and his wife by entireties without the consent of the wife, but neither may make a contract affecting title so as to
                        defeat the right of the survivor in the whole estate without the consent of the other. Moore v. Shore, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 446</cite>, 181 S.E. 275 (1935).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where lots are conveyed with restrictive covenants limiting buildings to residences, and one of such lots is owned by husband and wife by the entireties, husband may not convey or contract in respect to the negative easement of such lot over the other
                        lots without the consent of his wife, since the wife has the right to such negative easement as a part of the estate if she should survive her husband. Moore v. Shore, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 446</cite>,
                        181 S.E. 275 (1935).

                        Conveyances Between Husband and Wife. - While a deed executed by husband to wife in 1841, even if a fee simple deed, would have been void in law, and sustainable in equity only upon meritorious consideration, it is otherwise as to such deed executed now,
                        which is rendered valid under this section. McLamb v. McPhail, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 218</cite>, 35 S.E. 426 (1900).

                        Legislative Power to Declare Wife Free Trader. - There is no constitutional inhibition on the power of the legislature to declare where and how the wife may become a free trader, this section being intended to protect and not to disable her. Hall v. Walker,
                        <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 377</cite>, 24 S.E. 6 (1896); Dudley v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 572</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 590 (1962), commented on in 41 N.C.L. Rev. 311 (1963).

                    <p>
                        Liability of Husband for Rents Paid Wife After Foreclosure. - Where lands belonging to the separate estate of a wife were foreclosed under a deed of trust thereon duly executed, and after such foreclosure the rents from the land were paid to the wife,
                        the husband could not be held responsible for such rents by the person entitled thereto by virtue of the foreclosure, since under this section a wife is given sole ownership of her separate estate. In re Longley,
                        <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 488</cite>, 171 S.E. 788 (1933).

                    <p>
                        Liability of Wife as Surety to Husband. - This section, providing that the separate property of the wife shall not be liable for the debts of the husband, has no application to the obligation of the wife as surety of her husband, such obligation being
                        regarded as a direct one between the creditor and herself. Royal v. Southerland, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 405</cite>, 84 S.E. 708 (1915).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Action for Tort to Spouse. - Husband cannot sue to recover his wife's earnings or damages for torts committed on her, and there is no reason why wife can sue for torts or injuries inflicted on her husband. The law has never authorized the wife to maintain
                        such action for torts sustained by the husband. If the husband could maintain an action to recover damages for torts on his wife, she would be able to maintain an action on account of torts sustained by her husband. Such right
                        of action, if it existed in favor of the husband, should exist in favor of the wife. It should be in favor of both, or neither, but in view of the Constitution of 1868 and the statute on the subject, such action cannot be maintained
                        by either on account of the injury to the other. Hipp v. E.L. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 9</cite>, 108 S.E. 318 (1921).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Tort Action Against Spouse. - The right of a married woman to maintain an action against her husband to recover for negligent injury is not limited to residents of this State, but a nonresident wife may maintain an action here against her nonresident
                        husband on a transitory cause of action which arises in this State, and she is entitled to any recovery as her separate property. Bogen v. Bogen, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 51</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 649 (1941).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Power to Contract. - Contention that when the Constitution gave married women separate estates in their property, it gave them by necessary implication an unrestricted dominion over the property, to bind it directly or indirectly, except when expressly
                        forbidden, and an unrestricted right to contract, such as a feme sole or a man has, would be rejected on grounds that no such grant was implied, that the terms "sole and separate estate" had a known and definite meaning in the
                        law when the Constitution was framed, and that it would be taken that they were used in that instrument in the sense which had been affixed to them by prior decisions of the court. Pippen v. Wesson,

                    A person may insure his or her own life for the sole use and benefit of his or her spouse or children or both, and upon his or her death the proceeds from the insurance shall be paid to or for the benefit of the spouse or children or both, or to a guardian,
                    free from all claims of the representatives or creditors of the insured or his or her estate. Any insurance policy which insures the life of a person for the sole use and benefit of that person's spouse or children or both shall not
                    be subject to the claims of creditors of the insured during his or her lifetime, whether or not the policy reserves to the insured during his or her lifetime any or all rights provided for by the policy and whether or not the policy
                    proceeds are payable to the estate of the insured in the event the beneficiary or beneficiaries predecease the insured.

                        Purpose. - The purpose of this section is to enable the husband (spouse) to make valuable provision for his wife (spouse) and children after his death, above, beyond and unaffected by his estate, personal and real, and the conditions of the same remaining
                        at the time of his death. Burwell v. Snow, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 82</cite>, 11 S.E. 1090 (1890).

                    <p>
                        Certain Insurance Proceeds Not Part of Insured's Estate. - Where a life insurance policy is issued to an individual in the name and for the benefit of the wife (spouse) and children, it does not upon his death become a part of his estate. Burton v. Farinholt,
                        <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 260</cite> (1882).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under this section the proceeds from insurance policy payable to the wife (spouse) and children are not a part of the insured's estate so that they may be claimed by an heir or next of kin. Burwell v. Snow, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 82</cite>,
                        11 S.E. 1090 (1890).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wives (spouses) and children of bankrupts are protected from claims of the bankrupt's creditors, both during his life and at his death, if life insurance policies are for their sole benefit. In re Wolfe, 249 F. Supp. 784 (M.D.N.C. 1966), commented on
                        in 45 N.C.L. Rev. 696 (1967).

                        Protection Is Personal to Survivors. - This section clearly looks to provision for the wife (spouse) and children so that they may not be left destitute by the death of an insolvent husband and father (spouse and parent) and is personal to them when they
                        survive. Hooker v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 115</cite>, 8 S.E. 919 (1889).

        Exemption of Cash Value Allowed.
       </b> - Debtors could exempt the cash value in their life insurance policies as the beneficiaries were testamentary trusts in favor of the other spouse (S) and then their son and the testamentary trustees' (TT) abilities
                        to compromise claims, to use trust funds to make loans to and buy property from S's executors or trustees and to pay agents and professionals was restricted to the sole use and benefit of S and the son and did not allow the TTs
                        to compromise claims against the insureds; the wills directed the TTs to expend income and principal for the health, maintenance and support of S and then to their son, which was close enough to restricting the TTs' abilities to
                        apply the insurance funds to the sole use and benefit of the beneficiaries. In re Foley, - Bankr. - (Bankr. W.D.N.C. Sept. 7, 2016).

        Treatment of Insurance Proceeds When Received by Beneficiary.
       </b> - Upon filing a bankruptcy petition, a debtor can claim as exempt the value of life insurance policy. There is no provision, however, that extends the protection of the life insurance exemption to the beneficiary of
                        the policy once the proceeds are in the beneficiary's hands. The proceeds are treated like any other asset of the beneficiary and are available to his creditors, except to the extent that an exemption or other protection is available
                        to the beneficiary in his own right under applicable law. The result is no different where the beneficiary is the codebtor of the insured in a joint bankruptcy case. Butler v. Sharik, 41 Bankr. 388 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1984).

                        Where debtor wife died and debtor husband received life insurance proceeds prior to completion of their <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> plan, trustee's motion to modify
                        their plan to require debtor husband to pay a lump sum sufficient to pay allowed unsecured debts that were either joint debts or in debtor's name only was granted. Trustee did not seek to pay debtor wife's debts with the proceeds
                        because under North Carolina law, those proceeds were paid to the beneficiaries free from all claims of her creditors. In re Evans, - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Jan. 5, 2015).

        Trust Authorizing Payment to Decedent's Unsecured Creditors.
       </b> - Providing for one's spouse, children, or both through a trust as beneficiary of a life insurance policy does not in and of itself categorically violate the terms of N.C. Const., Art. X,
                        <span class="s1">

                        Section Limits Remedial Creativity. - This provision, in effect since 1868, was intended to stop the use of degrading punishments theretofore inflicted, but as a necessary consequence it also limited the creativity of trial judges in fashioning remedies
                        for crime. Shore v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 628</cite>, 227 S.E.2d 553 (1976).

                        Conditional Suspension of Punishment. - As a consequence of the desire for more diverse responses to criminal behavior, the practice developed to suspend a constitutionally designated punishment with the consent of defendant upon his performance of conditions.
                        And so long as these conditions are otherwise constitutional, related to the purposes of punishment, and otherwise reasonable they need not be limited to the type of punishment prescribed by this provision. Shore v. Edmisten,

                        No contact with victims. - Sentence provision which precluded defendant from having any contact with the victims did not violate N.C. Const., Art. XI,
                        <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 1, as the no contact recommendation was not a mandatory and binding part of the judgment, but rather, much like an order of restitution; furthermore, it constituted a recommendation to the Secretary of the Department
                        of Correction and the Parole Commission, not an order binding defendant upon entry of the judgment, as neither the Parole Commission nor the Department of Correction was bound by the judge's recommendation. State v. Curmon,

        Judiciary Cannot Strip Legislative Branch of Constitutional Power to Propose Amendments to Constitution.
       </b> - Superior court erred in declaring that the members of the General Assembly duly elected in 2016 lacked authority to pass bills proposing amendments to the state constitution for the people's consideration based on
                        the fact that certain members were elected from illegally gerrymandered districts because nothing in the appellate court's jurisprudence suggested that the judiciary could unilaterally strip the legislative branch of some of its
                        constitutional powers. It was simply beyond the appellate court's power to thwart the otherwise lawful exercise of constitutional power by the legislative branch to pass bills proposing amendments; thus, the challenged constitutional
                        amendments duly ratified by the people were valid. N.C. State Conf. of the NAACP v. Moore, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Sept. 15, 2020).

                    Ambulatory Seaward Boundary Consistent with Constitution. - While a proposal to permanently fix the seaward boundary for the State at specific coordinates would violate both <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.141.html#t141s141-6ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 141-6(a)</a></cite>,
                    and this section, the acceptance of an ambulatory boundary, which merely represents the seaward boundary's location at a certain time, and moves with changes to the shoreline, whether by erosion, accretion or fill deposition, would
                    be consistent with the Constitution and not require amendment of the statute; a reading of the State constitutional provision together with the statute and the case law reveal them to require that the eastern boundary always remain
                    at distance of three geographical miles from the extreme low water mark. See opinion of Attorney General to Gary W. Thompson, Chief, North Carolina Geodetic Survey, 1998 N.C.A.G. 7 (2/11/98).

                    <p>
                        What Is a General Law. - A general law defines a class which reasonably warrants special legislative attention and applies uniformly to everyone in the class. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources,
                        <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A law is general if any rational basis reasonably related to the objective of the legislation can be identified which justifies the separation of units of local government into included and excluded categories. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural
                        &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What Is a Local Act. - A local act unreasonably singles out a class for special legislative attention or, having made a reasonable classification, does not apply uniformly to all members of the designated class. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural
                        &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The constitutional prohibition against local acts simply commands that when legislating in certain specified fields the General Assembly must make rational distinctions among units of local government which are reasonably related to the purpose of the
                        legislation. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Distinguishing Between General and Local Acts. - The distinguishing factors between a valid general law and a prohibited local act are the related elements of reasonable classification and uniform application. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural
                        &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mere fact that a statute applies only to certain units of local government does not by itself render the statute a prohibited local act. Only if the statutory classification is unreasonable or under-inclusive will the statute be voided as a prohibited
                        local act. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Classification does not render a statute "local" if the classification is reasonable and based on rational difference of situation and condition. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>,
                        249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Regulation Need Not Reach Every Conceivable Class. - There is no constitutional requirement that a regulation, in other respects permissible, must reach every class to which it might be applied, i.e., that the legislature must be held rigidly to the choice
                        of regulating all or none. It is enough that the present statute strikes at the evil where it is felt, and reaches the class of cases where it most frequently occurs. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources,
                        <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                    <p>
                        While substantial distinctions are essential in classification, the distinctions need not be scientific or exact. The legislature has wide discretion in making classifications. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources,
                        <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                        Coastal Area Management Act Upheld. - The Coastal Area Management Act of 1974 (G.S. 113A-100 et seq.) is a general law which the General Assembly had power to enact. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources,
                        <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                        North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission. - Trial court did not err in determining the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission's actions did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; since the Coastal Area Management Act,

                        is self-evident that judicial authority to rule on variance requests is reasonably necessary to accomplish the Commission's statutory purpose. Riggings Homeowners, Inc. v. Coastal Res. Comm'n of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite>                        630, 747 S.E.2d 301 (2013).

                        sua sponte order was entered months after final judgment, and (3) the town was estopped from asserting the town possessed rights taken as the town's complaint said the town did not, the town did not raise the issue at an "all other
                        issues" hearing, at which the town disavowed the public trust doctrine, the town did not immediately appeal a vital ruling that the town condemned the property, and landowners introduced a scintilla of supporting evidence. Town
