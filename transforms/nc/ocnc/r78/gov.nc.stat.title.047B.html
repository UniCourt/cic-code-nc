        <p>
            It is hereby declared as a matter of public policy by the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina that:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li id="t47Bs47B-1ol11">
                Land is a basic resource of the people of the State of North Carolina and should be made freely alienable and marketable so far as is practicable.
            </li>
            <li id="t47Bs47B-1ol12">
                Nonpossessory interests in real property, obsolete restrictions and technical defects in titles which have been placed on the real property records at remote times in the past often constitute unreasonable restraints on the alienation and marketability
                of real property.
            </li>
            <li id="t47Bs47B-1ol13">
                Such interests and defects are prolific producers of litigation to clear and quiet titles which cause delays in real property transactions and fetter the marketability of real property.
            </li>
            <li id="t47Bs47B-1ol14">
                Real property transfers should be possible with economy and expediency. The status and security of recorded real property titles should be determinable from an examination of recent records only.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            It is the purpose of the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina to provide that if a person claims title to real property under a chain of record title for 30 years, and no other person has filed a notice of any claim of interest in the real
            property during the 30-year period, then all conflicting claims based upon any title transaction prior to the 30-year period shall be extinguished.

        </h4>
        <p>
            Purpose. - This Chapter was enacted in an effort to expedite the alienation and marketability of real property. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Applicability. - Marketable Title Act does not authorize a cause of action where parties are under a contractual obligation to pay fees pursuant to contract. Wilner v. Cedars of Chapel Hill, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite>            389, 773 S.E.2d 333, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 355</cite>, 777 S.E.2d 67, 2015 N.C. LEXIS 981 (2015).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            This Chapter does not affect the presumption in favor of the State set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.146.html#t146sIVa17s146-79" target="_blank">G.S. 146-79</a></cite>, relating to land controversies wherein the State
            is a party. Taylor v. Johnston, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 690</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 567 (1976).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Extinguishment of Reverter Right. - Exception under G.S. 47B-3(6) to the extinguishment of rights after a 30-year period set forth in the Real Property Marketable Title Act in 1973 did not apply to the purported property interests of landowners that had
            property adjacent to the railroad's right of way and who claimed to have a possibility of a reverter to the right of way, and any right of reverter was properly considered as extinguished. King Assocs., LLP v. Bechtler Dev. Corp.,
            <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 632 S.E.2d 243 (2006).
        </p>
        <p>
            Town's breach of contract claim against landowners for proposing to close a hospital built on land the town granted failed because, inter alia, the landowners had held the land for more than the 30 year period during which a challenge to the landowners'
            title could be brought. Town of Belhaven v. Pantego Creek, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 793 S.E.2d 711 (2016).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Possession of Real Property by Town. - Town's paving of an alley, maintenance of the utilities underneath the alley, and provision of municipal services to the alley were sufficient to establish actual possession of the alley; the fact that the town accepted
            dedication of the alley via use and control necessarily led to the conclusion that the town was in open and actual possession of the road and its interest in the alley could not be defeated by the North Carolina Marketable Title Act, G.S.

            What Constitutes Marketable Title. - Under this Chapter, if a person or those under whom he claims has a record title to real property of at least 30 years duration and there is nothing of record which by a title search of that chain would show a defect
            in the title, such a person has a marketable title in the property. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 294 S.E.2d 392 (1982), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d

        <p>
            In order to prove title to land under the Real Property Marketable Title Act, defendant had to establish: (1) that defendant, alone or together with his predecessors in title, was vested with an estate in real property which had been of record for at
            least thirty years; (2) the public record showed a title transaction at least thirty years old which purported to vest title in defendant or some other person from whom, by one or more title transactions, the property had passed to defendant;
            and (3) that nothing appeared of record to divest defendant of the estate. Beam v. Kerlee, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 203, 461 S.E.2d 911 (1995).

     Establishing Title.
    </b> - In order to establish title under the Real Property Marketable Title Act, a person must establish that (1) he alone or together with his predecessors in title, was vested with an estate in real property which had been of record
            for at least 30 years; (2) the public record showed a title transaction at least 30 years old which purported to vest title in him or some other person from whom, by one or more title transactions, the property had passed to him; and (3) that
            nothing appeared of record to divest him of that estate. Haw River Land &amp; Timber v. Lawyers Title Ins., 152 F.3d 275 (4th Cir. 1998).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court erred by applying G.S. 47B-3(3) in action to quiet title and by granting a directed verdict in favor of the defendant possessor where the claimants established prima facie ownership by presenting exhibits of plats showing their respective
            chains of title of more than 30 years from a grantor. The fact that the defendant was in fact in possession was not enough to resolve the factual dispute as the burden shifted to the defendant to defeat the plaintiffs' claims. Hill v. Taylor,
            <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 621 S.E.2d 284 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 363</cite>, 629 S.E.2d 852 (2006).

            In a case in which the State of North Carolina sought a declaratory judgment that it owned a 45-mile segment of the riverbed of the Yadkin River in North Carolina that, over the past 100 years, a power company purportedly acquired by deed and developed,
            the federal district court properly concluded the company proved its title to 99% of the relevant segment's riverbed under the Marketable Title Act (MTA). The district court found and North Carolina conceded that the company demonstrated satisfaction
            of its burden of proof under the statutory requirements of the MTA. North Carolina v. Alcoa Power Generating, 853 F.3d 140 (4th Cir. 2017), modified, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 8226 (2017).
        </p>
        <p>
            District court properly found that the company had title to a 45-mile segment of the riverbed that it had purportedly acquired by deed and developed because the record supported the district court's treatment of the relevant segment as a single segment,
            North Carolina did not obtain title to the riverbeds of the relevant segment by virtue of sovereignty because the relevant segment was not navigable at statehood, the company proved its title to 99% of the relevant segment's riverbed under
            North Carolina's Real Property Marketable Title Act and no exception applied, and the company proved title to the remaining one percent under adverse possession. North Carolina v. Alcoa Power Generating, Inc., - F.3d - (4th Cir. Apr. 3, 2017),

        <p>
            Effect of Subsection (c). - Under subsection (c) of this section, a person is divested of his interest where it depends on a title transaction that occurred prior to the 30-year period.

        </h4>
        <p>
            G.S. 47B-2 makes marketable record title subject to the matters stated in this section. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Section Serves to Protect Against Extinguishment of Certain Rights. - The exceptions listed under this section do not serve as a sword to establish title in the party claiming a marketable title under the act, but instead serve as a shield to protect
            from extinguishment the rights therein excepted. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Enumeration of exceptions in this section does not determine priority of one exception over the other. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no requirement that a person in possession of property hold it by adverse possession in order for his title to be perfected under this Chapter. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 294 S.E.2d 392 (1982),
            rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Effect of Defendants' Possession on Rights of Ownership. - Whatever rights the defendants have because they are in possession of property are not taken away by a competing marketable record title, but the mere fact of possession by the defendants does
            not alone establish their ownership of the land. Possession only protects whatever ownership the defendants already have on the date that marketability is to be determined. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>,
            308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court erred by applying G.S. 47B-3(3) in action to quiet title and by granting a directed verdict in favor of the defendant possessor where the claimants established prima facie ownership by presenting exhibits of plats showing their respective
            chains of title of more than 30 years from a grantor. The fact that the defendant was in fact in possession was not enough to resolve the factual dispute as the burden shifted to the defendant to defeat the plaintiffs' claims. Hill v. Taylor,
            <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 621 S.E.2d 284 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 363</cite>, 629 S.E.2d 852 (2006).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Title Acquired by Adverse Possession Protected. - Where the defendants had acquired title to an undivided interest by adverse possession when the action was filed, their possession of the property on the date that marketability was to be determined (the
            date the action was filed) protected their rights as owners of the undivided interest. Thus, even if the plaintiffs had a marketable record title on that date under this Chapter, it could not affect or extinguish the defendants' title previously
            acquired by adverse possession because that title was an interest protected by subdivision (3) of this section. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Title Acquired by Town Through Dedication. - Town's paving of an alley, maintenance of the utilities underneath the alley, and provision of municipal services to the alley were sufficient to establish actual possession of the alley; the fact that the
            town accepted dedication of the alley via use and control necessarily led to the conclusion that the town was in open and actual possession of the road and its interest in the alley could not be defeated by the North Carolina Marketable Title
            Act, G.S. 47B-1 et seq. Kraft v. Town of Mt. Olive, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 645 S.E.2d 132 (2007).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Defendants' Right as Cotenants Protected. - Possession by defendants on the crucial date would not give defendants title as to the plaintiffs' undivided interest in the property, but their right to possession of the property as cotenants, prior to partition
            or sale, would be protected, under the general rule that each cotenant has the right to enter upon the land and to enjoy it jointly with the other cotenants. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d
            244 (1983).

            <b>
     Covenant Restricting Property to Residential Use.
    </b> - Trial court properly entered a declaratory judgment holding that only the first covenant in a subdivision's restrictive covenants - restricting the properties to residential use - survived under the Marketable Title Act and that
            the remaining challenged covenants were extinguished because the challenged exception applied only to covenants applicable to a general or uniform scheme of development that either restricted the property to residential use only, or more narrowly
            restricted the property to multi-family or single-family residential use only, and the parties conceded that all of the challenged covenants were applicable to a general or uniform scheme of development. C Invs. 2, LLC v. Auger, - N.C. App.

            Reverter Interest in a Railroad Right-of-Way. - Exception under G.S. 47B-3(6) to the extinguishment of rights after a 30-year period set forth in the Real Property Marketable Title Act in 1973 did not apply to the purported property interests of landowners
            that had property adjacent to the railroad's right of way and who claimed to have a possibility of a reverter to the right of way. King Assocs., LLP v. Bechtler Dev. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 632 S.E.2d

            Where plaintiff and defendant both base their claims on recorded titles, each dating back more than 30 years, and defendant has been in possession for more than 30 years, plaintiff's record title does not affect defendant's marketable title. Heath v.
            Turner, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 294 S.E.2d 392 (1982), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).

            Possession Protects "Interest" or "Estate" and "Right" to Possession. - Defendants' possession of the property at the time of commencement of the lawsuit protects, as against a competing marketable title, both their "interest" or "estate" in the property,
            that is, the undivided interest, and their "right" to possession of the property, but does not give them any title which they do not already have. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).

            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            The "beginning of the 30-year period" in subdivision (10) of this section is the date of the title transaction purporting to create the interest claimed by the defendants, upon which they rely as the basis for the marketability of their title, and which
            was the most recent title transaction as of a date 30 years prior to the time when marketability is to be determined. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).

            Competing Title Not Extinguished If Created by Transaction Recorded After Beginning of Period. - Even though a party establishes a marketable record title to the property in question, it cannot extinguish a competing independent title if that competing
            title is created by a title transaction recorded after the beginning date for the establishment of the marketable record title. Heath v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 483</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 244 (1983).
