                    Editor's Note. - It appears that this Article was originally enacted as part of Session Laws 1943, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.033.html" target="_blank">Chapter 33</a></cite>, which was not printed as part of the
                    Session Laws but was in a separate bound volume in the Secretary of State's office. However, the Secretary of State's office no longer has such a volume in its possession. The volume may have burned in a warehouse fire that destroyed
                    some records. The sections first appear in "The North Carolina Code of 1943 - Legislative Edition," the report of the Legislative Commission on Recodification. As the origin of Article 1 is not completely certain, Session Laws 1943,
                    <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.033.html" target="_blank">Chapter 33</a></cite> is not listed in the historical citations for the sections in Article 1.

                    The Division of Legislative Drafting and Codification of Statutes of the State Department of Justice, under the direction and supervision of the Attorney General, shall complete and perfect the General Statutes, as enacted by the General Assembly of 1943,
                    by changing all references therein to the "Code," "North Carolina Code," "Code of 1943" or "North Carolina Code of 1943" to read "General Statutes," and by causing to be inserted therein all such general public statutes as may be enacted
                    at the 1943 Session of the General Assembly and all amendments, in their proper places in sections under the appropriate chapter and subdivisions of chapters, and by deleting all sections or portions of sections found to be expressly
                    repealed, or found to be repealed by virtue of the repeal of any cognate sections or parts of sections of the Consolidated Statutes or session laws, and by deleting repealed provisions and substituting in lieu thereof all proper amendments
                    of the General Statutes or of cognate sections of the Consolidated Statutes or session laws; and the Division is hereby authorized to change the number of sections and chapters, transfer sections, chapters and subdivisions of chapters
                    and make such other corrections which do not change the law, as may be found by the Division necessary in making an accurate, clear, and orderly statement of said laws. After the completion of such codification of the general and public
                    laws of 1943, such laws, as they appear in the printed volumes of the General Statutes, shall be deemed an accurate codification of the statutes of 1943 contained therein.

                    Session Laws 2004-186, s. 12.1, provides: "The General Assembly finds that the North Carolina Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission has adopted formal criteria for classifying felony offenses. The Sentencing Commission has identified three general
                    types of harms: harms to persons (including both physical and mental injury); harms to property; and harms to society. The degrees of harm are divided into three levels:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Injury to person, property, or society;
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Significant injury to person, property, or society; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) Serious injury to person, property, or society. The stated purpose of establishing the criteria was 'to create a rational and consistent philosophical basis for classifying offenses; to assure proportionality in severity; and to provide a guidepost
                    for classifying new crimes in the future.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In contrast to the felony classification criteria, the Commission did not create classification criteria for misdemeanors. However, the current misdemeanor sentencing laws include an assault offense that has serious injury as an element - even though
                    'serious injury to a person' is a category of harm for felony offense classification. The General Assembly finds that the classification of assault offenses that involve serious injury as misdemeanors is inconsistent with the Sentencing
                    Commission's classification of felonies based on harm.

                    Statutes, shall study the classification of misdemeanor offenses. In particular, the Commission shall examine the classification of assault offenses in relation to property offenses, crimes against society, and felony assault offenses.
                    The Commission shall develop a system for classifying misdemeanor offenses on the basis of their severity. The Commission may consider reclassifying existing offenses and creating new offenses in order to insure proportionality and
                    consistency. The Commission shall report its findings and recommendations to the 2005 General Assembly, 2005 Regular Session. The report shall describe the status of the Commission's work and shall include any completed policy recommendations
                    and proposed legislation. The Commission shall make a final report to the 2005 General Assembly, 2006 Regular Session."

                    the Conference of District Attorneys, the Office of Indigent Defense Services, and the School of Government, shall review all Class 3 misdemeanor offenses and provide recommendations to the 2011 General Assembly for reclassifying each
                    Class 3 misdemeanor as either an infraction or a Class 2 misdemeanor. The Commission may, in its discretion, consider other misdemeanor offenses for reclassification as infractions."
