       § 15B-24. Requiring defendant to pay restitution encouraged.
      </b>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Pursuant to a Court's power to require restitution as a condition of probation, parole or work-release privileges, a Court may require a defendant to pay restitution to a victim, regardless of whether the victim receives compensation from the Crime Victims
                    Compensation Fund, or to the Fund. It is the intent of the General Assembly that a victim's receipt of compensation from the Fund shall not discourage a Court from considering, where appropriate, payment of restitution by the defendant
                    and alternatives to incarceration of the defendant.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The General Assembly of North Carolina hereby declares as a matter of public policy that:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li id="t15Ba02s15B-30ol11">
                        No person who commits a crime should thereafter gain monetary profit as the result of committing the crime.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t15Ba02s15B-30ol12">
                        Victims of crime have a special relationship to any profit from the crime committed against them, including the personal belongings and memorabilia of a convicted felon whose criminal actions and resulting notoriety enhance the value of those belongings
                        and memorabilia.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t15Ba02s15B-30ol13">
                        To the extent profit from crime would not have been realized but for an offender's commission of illegal acts, an offender does not have an equitable interest in the profit and allowing the offender to retain the profit would result in the offender's
                        unjust enrichment.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The General Assembly finds that the State has a compelling interest in ensuring that persons convicted of crimes do not profit from those crimes, and that victims of crime are compensated by those who have harmed them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The General Assembly further finds that crime victims have difficulty satisfying restitution orders or civil judgments entered against their offenders because the victims often lack the expertise and resources to identify or locate assets that an offender
                    may have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to carry out this public policy and to satisfy these compelling interests, the General Assembly has enacted the provisions of this Article providing a mechanism by which crime victims are notified of the existence of an offender's assets and
                    are authorized to bring an action to recover those assets.
