                    <p>
                        Partition Regulated by Statute. - Since 1868, the partition of land between tenants in common has been regulated by statute. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 385 (1962).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Proceedings Are Equitable in Nature. - Partition proceedings have been consistently held to be equitable in nature. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 496</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 585 (1965); Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox,
                        <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 553 (1966).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this State partition proceedings have been consistently held to be equitable in nature, and the statutes are not a strict limitation upon the authority of the court. Dunn v. Dunn, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 159,
                        245 S.E.2d 580 (1978); Gray v. Crotts, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 365, 293 S.E.2d 626 (1982).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Procedure Prescribed for Special Proceedings Applies. - A proceeding for partition of real or personal property is a special proceeding under procedure in all respects the same as that prescribed by law in special proceedings except as modified by this
                        chapter. Dubose v. Harpe, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 672</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 454 (1954).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction. - Where the parties invoked the jurisdiction of the district court to equitably distribute their marital property in an action for absolute divorce and equitable distribution of their marital property, the district court did not lose jurisdiction
                        to equitably distribute the marital property because of its failure to enter a judgment in the equitable distribution case before the special proceeding seeking partition of the marital property was filed in the office of the clerk
                        of superior court. Garrison v. Garrison, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 369 S.E.2d 628 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking Rendered Partition Suit Moot. - Taking which was proper under this section rendered earlier suit for partition of property moot; State did not have to wait until partition proceedings had been completed to condemn petitioner's interest. Coastland
                        Corp. v. North Carolina Wildlife Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 343, 517 S.E.2d 661 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sovereign immunity does not bar a suit for partition against the State, in its initial stage where petitioner merely seeks, through a "special proceeding," to have what already belongs to him and makes no demands on the State's property or ownership.
                        Coastland Corp. v. North Carolina Wildlife Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 343, 517 S.E.2d 661 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A tenancy in common is the foundation upon which partition is based. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 194</cite>, 102 S.E.2d 868 (1958).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under this Chapter, a tenant in common is entitled to partition as a matter of right. McDowell v. McDowell, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 700, 301 S.E.2d 729 (1983).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This right may be waived, however, for a reasonable time, by either an express or implied contract. McDowell v. McDowell, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 700, 301 S.E.2d 729 (1983).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A cotenants' right to partition can be contracted away in a deed of separation entered into while the property is still owned by the parties as tenants by the entirety. McDowell v. McDowell, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite>                        700, 301 S.E.2d 729 (1983).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To estop a cotenant from partitioning a piece of property, there must be an express or implied contract or agreement waiving the right to partition. Roberson v. Roberson, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 404, 309 S.E.2d
                        520 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 626</cite>, 315 S.E.2d 691 (1984).

                    <p>
                        Chapter Does Not Apply to Partition by Agreement. - This Chapter applies to compulsory or judicial partition. It does not apply to partition by agreement. Keener v. Den, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 132</cite> (1875).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As to authority of court in partition by agreement, and procedure therein, see Outlaw v. Outlaw, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 255</cite>, 114 S.E. 4 (1922). See also, Newsome v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 295</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Superior court had no authority to partition marital property pursuant to the provisions of this section where the jurisdiction of the district court had been properly invoked to equitably distribute such marital property. Garrison v. Garrison,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 369 S.E.2d 628 (1988).

                        Dismissal of Appeal Held Error. - Where petitioners excepted to the commissioners' report under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.046.html#t46a01s46-19" target="_blank">G.S. 46-19</a></cite>, the trial court did not
                        have the authority to dismiss the appeal due to petitioners failure to state specific grounds why the commissioners' report should not be confirmed. Jenkins v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 390 S.E.2d 683

                            Jurisdiction of Superior Court. - The superior court acquires jurisdiction over proceedings to partition lands upon their being transferred by the clerk thereto, in terms, and may proceed therewith and fully determine all matters in controversy. In such
                            case it is immaterial whether it was properly instituted before the clerk. Baggett v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 26</cite>, 76 S.E. 86 (1912).
                        </p>

                            Where petitioner tried but failed to invoke the jurisdiction of the district court for equitable distribution of the parties' marital property the superior court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the proceeding for the partition of the subject property.

                            Tenancy in Common Is Necessary Basis for Partition. - Tenancy in common in land is the necessary basis for maintenance of a special proceeding for partition by petition to the superior court. Murphy v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 455</cite>,
                            70 S.E.2d 697 (1952); Gray v. Crotts, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 365, 293 S.E.2d 626 (1982).

                        <p>
                            A tenancy in common is the foundation upon which partition is based. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 194</cite>, 102 S.E.2d 868 (1958); Hi-Fort, Inc. v. Burnette, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 428,

                            Tenant in Common Is Entitled to Partition as Matter of Right. - A tenant in common is entitled as a matter of right to partition of real estate held in common, to the end that he may have and enjoy his share therein in severalty. Davis v. Griffin,
                            <cite

                        <p>
                            Ordinarily a tenant in common in realty or personalty is entitled to partition of the property. Chadwick v. Blades, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 609</cite>, 188 S.E. 198 (1936).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Tenant Must Have Right of Possession. - A tenant in common is entitled to a compulsory partition, and to enable said tenant to maintain a proceeding for such partition he must have an estate in possession or the right of possession. The possession need
                            not be actual. Moore v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 736</cite>, 24 S.E.2d 749 (1943). See Wood v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 93</cite>, 48 Am. R. 639 (1884); Osborne v. Mull,

                        <p>
                            Waiver of Right to Partition. - While it is the general rule that a tenant in common may have partition as a matter of right, it is equally well established that a cotenant, either by an express or implied contract, may waive his right to partition for
                            a reasonable time. When he does, partition will be denied him or his successors who take with notice. Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 553 (1966).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A person can validly contract away his right to partition in a deed of separation. Hepler v. Burnham, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 210 S.E.2d 509 (1975).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tenants in common may make a valid agreement whereby the right to partition is modified or limited, provided the waiver of the right to partition is not for an unreasonable length of time. Chadwick v. Blades, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 609</cite>,
                            188 S.E. 198 (1936). See, 15 N.C.L. Rev. 279 (1937).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Statutes declaring that joint tenants or tenants in common shall have a right to partition were never intended to interfere with a contract between such tenants modifying or limiting this otherwise incidental right, or to render it incompetent for parties
                            to make such contracts, either at the time of the creation of the tenancy or afterwards. Hepler v. Burnham, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 210 S.E.2d 509 (1975).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this State partition proceedings have been consistently held to be equitable in nature, and the court has jurisdiction to adjust all equities in respect to the property. Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>,
                            149 S.E.2d 553 (1966).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Petitioner Must Do Equity. - Partition is always subject to the principle that he who seeks it by coming into equity for relief must do equity. Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>, 149 S.E.2d
                            553 (1966); Gray v. Crotts, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 365, 293 S.E.2d 626 (1982).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Equity will not award partition at the suit of one in violation of his own agreement or in violation of a condition or restriction imposed on the estate by one through whom he claims. The objection to partition in such cases is in the nature of an estoppel.
                            Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 553 (1966).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The refusal of partition to one who has brought suit therefor in violation of his contract appears to bear a close analogy to the grant of specific performance of a contract. Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>,
                            149 S.E.2d 553 (1966).

                        <p>
                            What Petition Should Allege. - A petition under this section is in the ordinary form of a complaint in a civil action, and should allege that the plaintiffs and defendants are tenants in common of the land, should describe the land; should state the interest
                            of each party; and should indicate that the plaintiffs desire to hold their interests in severalty and that they are entitled to partition for that purpose. Pearson v. McKenney, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                            544, 169 S.E.2d 46 (1969).

                            Omission of Term of Court. - A petition in special proceedings for partition was not demurrable because it did not give the term of court or any court in the caption. Hartsfield v. Bryan, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 166</cite>,

                            Right of Actual Partition May Not Be Used to Injure Another. - Partition of land in kind is a matter of right, but this right of actual partition may not be so used as to injure another. Brown v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>,

                            Prima facie, a tenant in common is entitled, as a matter of right, to a partition of the lands so that he may enjoy his share in severalty. If, however, an actual partition cannot be made without injury to some or all of the parties interested, he is
                            equally entitled to a partition by sale. Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 553 (1966).

                        <p>
                            There should be a partition in kind unless such partition will cause material and substantial injury to some or all of the parties interested. Brown v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 577 (1965).

                            Determination of Whether Land Should Be Partitioned or Sold. - Whether or not, in a proceeding instituted under this section for partition of land held by two or more persons as tenants in common, there shall be an actual partition or a sale for partition,
                            as authorized by statute, involves a question of fact to be determined by the court. Talley v. Murchison, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 205</cite>, 193 S.E. 148 (1937).

                            Whether land should be divided in kind or sold for partition is a question of fact for decision of the clerk of superior court, subject to review by the judge on appeal; it is not an issue of fact for a jury. Brown v. Boger,

                            Test Is Whether Value of Share Would Be Materially Less on Partition Than on Sale. - The test of whether a partition in kind would result in great prejudice to the cotenant owners is whether the value of the share of each in case of a partition would
                            be materially less than the share of each in the money equivalent that could probably be obtained for the whole. Brown v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 577 (1965).

                            Determinative Circumstances. - On the question of partition or sale, the determinative circumstances usually relate to the land itself and its location, physical condition, quantity, and the like. Brown v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>,
                            139 S.E.2d 577 (1965).

                        <p>
                            The physical difficulty of division is only a circumstance for the consideration of the court. Brown v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 577 (1965).

                            The burden is on him who seeks a sale in lieu of actual partition to allege and prove the facts upon which the order of sale must rest. Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 553

                            Ownership of Adjacent Land by Tenant in Common. - While it is true that courts may consider whether one of the tenants in common owns other land adjoining the land to be partitioned, that does not, ipso facto, mean that a tenant in common's share of the
                            property being partitioned must be laid off next to his homeplace. Gray v. Crotts, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 365, 293 S.E.2d 626 (1982).

                            Drawing of Lots to Assign Shares. - When there is no question that parcels have been equally divided in terms of value, the drawing of lots as a method of assigning the shares to tenants in common is specifically approved, even though this article makes
                            no provision for partitioning by lot or chance. Gray v. Crotts, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 365, 293 S.E.2d 626 (1982).

                            of land with contingent limitations over to persons not presently determinable, had the right, as against the contingent remaindermen, to partition the several tracts so that petitioners might hold some of the tracts in fee

                            Judgment Creditors and Mortgagees. - In proceedings for partition, judgment creditors of the individual tenants, and their mortgagees, are proper parties to the proceedings; and where such lienors have been made parties thereto, it is error for the trial
                            judge to dismiss the action as to them. Holley v. White, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 77</cite>, 89 S.E. 1061 (1916).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The mortgagee of one tenant in common is not a necessary party to special proceedings to partition the land. Rostan v. Huggins, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 386</cite>, 5 S.E.2d 162, 126 A.L.R. 410 (1939).

         III. PLEA OF SOLE SEIZIN.

                        <p>
                            Effect of Plea. - Where the plea of sole seizin is set up, the effect is practically to convert the procedure into an action of ejectment. When it is not set up, the parties are taken to be tenants in common, and the only inquiry is as to the interests
                            owned. Graves v. Barrett, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 267</cite>, 35 S.E. 539 (1900); Haddock v. Stocks, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 70</cite>, 83 S.E. 9 (1914).

                        <p>
                            Where the plea of sole seizin is set up, the proper course is for the court to try title to the land. Purvis v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. 22</cite>, 69 Am. Dec. 773 (1857).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Waiver of Plea. - Where, in partition, a plea of sole seizin is not put in before the order of partition is made, it will be considered as waived. Wright v. McCormick, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. 14</cite> (1873).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Burden of Proof. - Where the defendants plead sole seizin in proceedings to partition lands, the burden of proof was with the plaintiff, which would devolve upon the defendant to establish adverse possession, when relied upon for title, after a prima
                            facie case of tenancy in common was made out. Lester v. Harvard, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 83</cite>, 91 S.E. 698 (1917).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where defendants in partition deny cotenancy and plead sole seizin, the burden is upon plaintiffs to show title in the parties by tenancy in common. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 541</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 569
                            (1948).

                        Relationship to Bankruptcy Law. - In finding that judicial economy favored partition of co-owned property as part of debtor's <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> case rather
                        than through North Carolina state court proceeding that had yet to be initiated, court noted that debtor could immediately market property and court could consider private or public proposed sale upon only 21 days' notice to parties
                        in interest, but delay in state court could be compounded because it could require mediation before making determination of sale and, once judicial sale was ordered, process was far less efficient under state law. Bankruptcy court
                        liquidated property on routine basis with little or no delay and was empowered by Congress with avenues to accomplish reasonable and efficient liquidation of assets. In re Guy, 587 B.R. 475 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2018).

                        Owelty may be enforced against land inherited by infants from an adult who owned the land when the owelty was made a charge against it, though as to land partitioned to an infant cotenant owelty is not payable until he reaches his majority. Powell v.
                        Weatherington, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 40</cite>, 32 S.E. 380 (1899).

                    <p>
                        Section Applies Only to Compulsory Partition. - Where partition is not compulsory but is under an agreement between cotenants, this section is not applicable. Newsome v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 295</cite>, 84 S.E.
                        337 (1915); Outlaw v. Outlaw, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 255</cite>, 114 S.E. 4 (1922).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actual partition must be on the basis of the division made by the commissioners and not otherwise. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 385 (1962).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Authority of Commissioners and Effect of Partition. - In partition proceedings, the duty of the commissioners is to make actual partition among the tenants in common and to make a full report thereof; they have no other function. The allotment of the
                        respective shares in partition proceedings creates no new estate and conveys no title, the sole effect thereof being to sever the unity of possession and to fix the physical boundaries of the tracts. Therefore, no title vests in
                        the commissioners, and after confirmation of their report they have no further authority, and purported deeds executed by them to the several tenants convey nothing. McLamb v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 432</cite>,
                        94 S.E.2d 331 (1956).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Validity of Action of Two Commissioners. - Two commissioners may fill the vacancy caused by the absence of the third commissioner, when done in the presence of the interested parties and without their objection. Simmons v. Foscue,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">81 N.C. 86</cite> (1879).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where three commissioners are appointed to partition land the action of any two of them is valid. Thompson v. Shemwell, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 222</cite> (1885).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The court's approval of a report based upon the findings of only two appraisers or commissioners was held reversible error in Sharpe v. Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 92</cite>, 185 S.E. 634 (1936).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the very terms of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.046.html#t46a01s46-17" target="_blank">G.S. 46-17</a></cite>, the signature of two of the commissioners to their report is sufficient. Thompson v. Shemwell,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">93 N.C. 222</cite> (1885); Sharpe v. Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 92</cite>, 185 S.E. 634 (1936).

                    <p>
                        Existing Easements. - It would seem that existing easements are not destroyed by a division in partition. See Jones v. Swindell, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 34</cite>, 96 S.E. 663 (1918).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Improvements. - Where in a partition an excessive portion is allotted to one individual, but is reduced on a reallotment, that individual cannot be allowed for improvements made on the excess, as it was his own folly to make them before obtaining a final
                        decree and his deed. Carland v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 506</cite> (1856).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A tenant in common is entitled to recover against a cotenant for betterments he has placed on the land. Daniel v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 137</cite>, 79 S.E. 425 (1913).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where no appeal is taken from the order allowing for improvements, it precludes the plaintiff from having the good faith of the defendant in making the improvements inquired into. Fisher v. Toxaway Co., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 547</cite>,
                        88 S.E. 887 (1916).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Basis of Owelty. - The right to owelty on an unequal partition is based on the implied warranty attaching to each share from all the others. Nixon v. Lindsay, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 230</cite> (1855); Cheatham v. Crews,
                        <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. 38</cite> (1883).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Equality in value must be afforded by the assessment of an owelty charge. Moore v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 498</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 526 (1944).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Owelty Is Not a Mere Lien Debt. - The charge in partition upon the more valuable shares is not a mere debt secured by lien. The debtor is a tenant in common with the holder of the share in whose favor the decree is entered to the extent of the charge,
                        until the same shall be satisfied. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 340</cite>, 12 S.E. 136 (1890).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Charge upon the Land. - The sums charged upon "the more valuable dividends" in partitions of lands are charges, not upon the persons of the owners of such dividends, but upon the land alone. Young v. Trustees of Davidson College,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">62 N.C. 261</cite> (1867).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Owelty Follows Land. - Charges upon land for equality of partition follow the land into the hands of all persons to whom it may come; and they are held to be affected by constructive notice. Dobbin v. Rex, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 444</cite>,
                        11 S.E. 260 (1890); Powell v. Weatherington, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 40</cite>, 32 S.E. 380 (1899). As to the docketing of owelty charges, see <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.046.html#t46a01s46-21" target="_blank">G.S. 46-21</a></cite>.
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Land Charged with Payment of Several Shares. - Payment under execution of the charge in favor of one share does not discharge the land in the hands of the purchaser from the payment of a charge in favor of another share. Meyers v. Rice,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">107 N.C. 24</cite>, 12 S.E. 66 (1890).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A discharge in bankruptcy does not cancel the charge of owelty of partition against the land of the bankrupt. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 340</cite>, 12 S.E. 136 (1890).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Charges for equality of partition should be enforced by proceedings in rem against the more valuable shares of the land divided, and not by personal judgments against the owners thereof. Young v. Trustees of Davidson College,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">62 N.C. 261</cite> (1867); Waring v. Wadsworth, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 345</cite> (1879); Meyers v. Rice, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 24</cite>, 12 S.E. 66 (1890).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A motion in the cause for execution is the proper proceeding to subject land charged with owelty of partition to the payment thereof. Meyers v. Rice, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 24</cite>, 12 S.E. 66 (1890).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Parties to Action to Recover Owelty. - The widow of the party upon whose land a charge was placed was not a necessary party to an action brought to recover the sum charged. Ruffin v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 253</cite>                        (1874).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Counterclaim. - A cotenant who is charged in partition proceedings with owelty may set up by way of counterclaim damages sustained by his eviction from part of the land awarded to him. Huntley v. Cline, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 458</cite>                        (1885).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Division of Costs. - The costs in proceedings for partition, including the expenses of the partition, are charges upon the several shares in proportion to their respective values. Hinnant v. Wilder, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 149</cite>,
                        29 S.E. 221 (1898).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Costs Precede Homestead Exemption. - Where, in an ex parte proceeding for the partition of lands, partition was duly made and one part was assigned in severalty to A, and A failed to pay the costs adjudged against her and the share allotted to her was
                        sold on execution issued on the judgment, and no homestead was allotted to A, who had no other land, and her interest was not worth $1,000.00, in an action by the heirs of A against the purchaser at the execution sale, the sale
                        was held to be valid. Hinnant v. Wilder, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 149</cite>, 29 S.E. 221 (1898).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Confirmation Necessary to Execution. - No execution can issue to satisfy a charge against land in partition proceedings until the commissioners' report has been confirmed. In re Ausborn, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 42</cite>,
                        29 S.E. 56 (1898).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Assignment by Coin Flip. - Where commissioners properly divided property into two sections that were nearly equal, assigning the property by flipping a coin was not improper. Robertson v. Robertson, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite>                        298, 484 S.E.2d 831 (1997).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Separately Owned Property. - When partitioning property, such factors as separately owned property may in the discretion of the commissioners be considered; however, such consideration is not required. Robertson v. Robertson,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 484 S.E.2d 831 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Distribution of Proceeds in Proportion to Contribution. - Because the trial court has the power to adjust all equities between the parties with respect to the property to be partitioned, the trial court committed no error under
                        <cite
                            class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.046.html#t46a01s46-10" target="_blank">G.S. 46-10</a></cite>, by distributing the net proceeds of the property according to petitioner's and respondent's respective rights and interests therein and finding
                            that the equities favored an unequal distribution in order to compensate petitioner for his additional contribution toward the purchase of the property. Tarr v. Zalaznik, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 245 (2019).
                            <br />

                    <p>
                        Superior Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Confirming Partition. - Superior court did not abuse its discretion by confirming the partition of property by a commissioners' report because all the parties were properly included and before the court,
                        as each party signed a consent order, and the land was allocated based upon unequal shares of ownership through transfers and acquisitions, and each tract was valued differently due to the differing values of the land and the percentage
                        of ownership to be allocated. Donnell-Smith v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 164, 825 S.E.2d 672 (2019), review denied, 837 S.E.2d 894, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 140 (N.C. 2020).

                        Alteration of Registered Report Not Authorized. - The report of commissioners in partition proceedings, dividing land, when filed, approved, confirmed, recorded and registered, becomes a muniment of title, and the commissioners, without the order and
                        approval of the court, have no right to alter or change the same. Clinard v. Brummell, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 547</cite>, 41 S.E. 675 (1902).

                        Findings as to Value Not Reviewable. - The findings of commissioners on value are not subject to review in the appellate court. Fisher v. Toxaway Co., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 547</cite>, 88 S.E. 887 (1916); Allen v. Allen,
                        <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 385 (1962); Pearson v. McKenney, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 544, 169 S.E.2d 46 (1969).

                        The mere fact that the commissioners did not file their report within the statutory period of 60 days after notification did not vitiate the report or preclude confirmation. Thompson v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 416</cite>,

                        "Mistake, Fraud or Collusion". - Since an opportunity for correcting ordinary error or irregularities is provided to a party by the filing of exceptions under this section and by appeal from the decree of confirmation in G.S. 1-272 [see now G.S. 1-301.1
                        et seq.], it should be clear that the legislature did not intend the word "mistake" in this section to apply to ordinary error and irregularities by the commissioner or the clerk; rather, the words "mistake, fraud or collusion"
                        in this section, construed in pari materia, are applicable to substantial defects or omissions in the proceedings which probably would not be discovered in time to assert rights within the 10-day limit for filing exceptions to
                        the report of the commissioners or to appeal from the confirmation order, and which would likely result in the denial of a substantial right if not corrected. Macon v. Edinger, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite>                        624, 272 S.E.2d 411 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 374</cite>, 278 S.E.2d 256 (1981).

                    <p>
                        This section essentially governs two situations. First of all, in partition proceedings where there is no mistake, fraud, or collusion alleged, a party has 10 days from the filing of the commissioner's report to file an exception to the proposed partition.
                        If no exception is filed, the report is confirmed. The second part of this section covers situations where a party is claiming that mistake, fraud, or collusion has occurred. In this instance, a party, even after confirmation,
                        may impeach the proceedings. Brown v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 694, 306 S.E.2d 502 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 476</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 882 (1984).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Proceedings Interlocutory until Confirmation. - Until the decree of confirmation by the judge, the proceedings for the partition of lands are not final, but interlocutory, and rest in his discretion. Tayloe v. Carrow, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 6</cite>,
                        72 S.E. 76 (1911).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All orders of the clerk or judge are interlocutory except a final judgment or decree confirming the report of the commissioners. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 385 (1962).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Time for Filing Exceptions. - Exceptions to the report of the commissioners appointed to make partition of land must be filed within 20 (now 10) days after the report is filed. Floyd v. Rock, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 10</cite>,
                        38 S.E. 33 (1901).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Filing of Exceptions Not Untimely. - Where, within the required time after filing the report, defendant notified the clerk that he desired to file exceptions, whereupon the clerk made a memorandum that defendant had objected to the report, and later amended
                        exceptions, setting out various grounds why the report should not be confirmed, were filed with the clerk without objection, it was held error to confirm the report on the ground that no exception had been filed within the statutory
                        time. McDevitt v. McDevitt, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 644</cite>, 64 S.E. 761 (1909).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Effect of Failure to Object. - Where no exceptions were filed and no objections made, plaintiff was entitled to a decree of confirmation as a matter of law. Roberts v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 309</cite>, 55 S.E.
                        721 (1906); Macon v. Edinger, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 624, 272 S.E.2d 411 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 374</cite>, 278 S.E.2d 256 (1981).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Determination of Whether to Confirm. - If exceptions are filed in apt time, whether the report of the commissioners should be confirmed is for determination by the clerk and, upon appeal from his order, by the judge. Allen v. Allen,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 385 (1962).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Superior court did not abuse its discretion by confirming the partition of property by a commissioners' report because all the parties to the action were properly included and before the court, as each party signed a consent order, and the land was allocated
                        based upon unequal shares of ownership through transfers and acquisitions, and each tract was valued differently due to the differing values of the land and the percentage of ownership to be allocated. Donnell-Smith v. McLean,
                        <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 164, 825 S.E.2d 672 (2019), review denied, 837 S.E.2d 894, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 140 (N.C. 2020).

                    <p>
                        Clerk Has Jurisdiction Initially to Pass upon Exceptions. - Clearly, the clerk has authority and jurisdiction, initially, to pass upon exceptions to the report of the commissioners in a special proceeding for partition. Allen v. Allen,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 385 (1962).

                    <p>
                        Powers of Clerk in Hearing on Exceptions. - In a hearing on exceptions to the report of the commissioners, the clerk may (1) recommit the report for correction or further consideration, or (2) vacate the report and direct a reappraisal by the same commissioners,
                        or (3) vacate the report, discharge the commissioners, and appoint new commissioners to view the premises and make partition thereof. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>, 128 S.E.2d
                        385 (1962).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The clerk is without authority to alter the report that is filed, either by changing the division lines or by enlarging or decreasing the owelty charge assessed by the commissioners. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>,
                        128 S.E.2d 385 (1962).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right of Clerk to Set Aside Former Order. - Where it appeared of record that the clerk of the court in proceedings to partition lands had rendered a judgment in the plaintiff's favor, and had set it aside on the defendant's motion made before him 17 months
                        thereafter upon allegation of fraud in its procurement, and that the plaintiff had fraudulently prevented the defendant from appearing and defending, to which the plaintiff did not except, the plaintiff's motion in the superior
                        court, in the cause transferred, for judgment in his favor upon the whole record, could not be allowed. The clerk was within the provisions of this section in setting aside his former order in plaintiff's favor, on defendant's
                        motion, at the time it was made before him. Turner v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 38</cite>, 79 S.E. 257 (1913).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Judge May Confirm Report or Vacate It and Enter Appropriate Interlocutory Orders. - In a de novo hearing before the judge, where the question is whether the report of the commissioners should be confirmed, the judge may confirm or he may vacate and enter
                        appropriate interlocutory orders. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 385 (1962).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where the clerk had confirmed the report of the commissioners, the question before the judge was whether the division made by the commissioners was fair and equitable. If so, a final judgment or decree confirming the report of the commissioners should
                        have been entered. If not, the report of the commissioners should have been set aside; and, if set aside, the court by interlocutory order, should have ordered a new division by commissioners or, if the facts justified, a partition
                        sale. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 385 (1962).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Judge May Not Order Partition Different from That Made by Commissioners. - The judge may not, based on his findings as to what would constitute an equitable division, adjudge a partition of the land different from that made by the commissioners. Allen
                        v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 305</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 385 (1962).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Effect of Findings of Judge. - Where an actual partition of lands has been ordered, whether the division made by the commissioners was fair and equitable or unequal in value is a question of fact to be determined by the judge of the superior court upon
                        an appeal from a judgment of the clerk affirming the report of commissioners, and the findings of the judge are conclusive and binding if there is any evidence in the record to support them. West v. West,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">257 N.C. 760</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 531 (1962).

                    <p>
                        Petitioners Not Required to State Specific Grounds. - Where petitioners excepted to the commissioners' report under this section, the trial court did not have the authority to dismiss the appeal due to petitioners' failure to state specific grounds why
                        the commissioners' report should not be confirmed. Jenkins v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 390 S.E.2d 683 (1990).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appeals May Be to Different Judges. - Where appeals from the clerk in proceedings for partition are made successively to different judges, a judge before whom a later appeal comes may set aside or modify a former interlocutory order, it not being required
                        for that purpose that the same judge should have passed upon the former appeals. Tayloe v. Carrow, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 6</cite>, 72 S.E. 76 (1911).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction of Judge in Chambers. - A judge in chambers has jurisdiction of appeals from the report of commissioners appointed in special proceedings to partition land. McMillan v. McMillan, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 577</cite>,
                        31 S.E. 729 (1898).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Confirmation Is Error Where Commissioners Fail to Carry Out Orders. - Where commissioners fail to carry out the orders of the court in some material respect, it is error to confirm their report, especially if it appears that a party or parties have probably
                        suffered injury by reason of such failure. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 496</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 585 (1965).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Resale After Confirmation. - After confirmation a resale may be ordered for sufficient cause shown; but this should be upon petition or notice to the purchaser who has acquired equitable rights under the first confirmation. Ex parte White,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">82 N.C. 377</cite> (1880).

                    <p>
                        Statute of Limitations. - Where the commissioners to divide lands held by tenants in common award owelty to one of them to equalize his share with the other, the 10-year statute of limitations began to run from the confirmation of the report by the clerk,
                        approved by the judge, and the fact that the clerk had not docketed the judgment in the 7 years after confirmation, as between the parties having at least constructive notice of the proceedings, did not alone repel the bar of the
                        statute. Cochran v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 663</cite>, 135 S.E. 794 (1926).

                        Effect of Adjudication Before Clerk. - Matters not in issue and claims for different rights are not concluded by partition proceedings before the clerk. Gillans v. Edmonson, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 602</cite>, 69 S.E. 9
                        (1910).

                    <p>
                        In proceedings to partition lands among tenants in common, the adjudication before the clerk operates as an estoppel as to them and those in privity with them, when no appeal has been taken. Southern State Bank v. Leverette,

                <p>
                    If the court orders owelty, the clerk shall enter the owelty on the judgment docket in the same manner as judgments are entered on the docket. The clerk shall mark as plaintiffs on the judgment docket persons whose shares are to be paid owelty, and the
                    clerk shall mark as defendants on the judgment docket persons whose shares are charged with owelty. The entry on the docket shall contain the title of the special proceeding in which the property was partitioned. When owelty is paid,
                    the entry upon the judgment docket shall be marked satisfied in the same manner as judgments are cancelled and marked satisfied, and the clerk shall be entitled to the same fees for entering this judgment as the clerk is entitled to
                    for docketing other judgments. The docketing of owelty under this section does not release the property from the owelty. Any judgment docketed under this section is not a lien on any property other than the property charged with owelty.

                        Relationship to Bankruptcy Law. - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> debtor's sister was not entitled to relief from stay to pursue a judicial partition by sale in North
                        Carolina state court of property that she and debtor held as tenants in common where judicial economy favored partition as part of debtor's <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite>                        case rather than through a state court proceeding that had yet to be commenced and where releasing the property from the protection of the bankruptcy court was not in the estate's best interests, as it appeared from the sister's
                        alleged attempts to sabotage a private sale that she would prefer to obtain the property at a reduced cost through a forced judicial sale. In re Guy, 587 B.R. 475 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2018).

                        In finding that judicial economy favored partition of co-owned property as part of debtor's <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> case rather than through North Carolina state
                        court proceeding that had yet to be initiated, court noted that debtor could immediately market property and court could consider private or public proposed sale upon only 21 days' notice to parties in interest, but delay in state
                        court could be compounded because it could require mediation before making determination of sale and, once judicial sale was ordered, process was far less efficient under state law. Bankruptcy court liquidated property on routine
                        basis with little or no delay and was empowered by Congress with avenues to accomplish reasonable and efficient liquidation of assets. In re Guy, 587 B.R. 475 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2018).

                        Section Is Inapplicable Where Parties Agree to Partition. - Where all parties agree that the entire tract can be partitioned without injury to any of the parties in interest, the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.046.html#t46a01s46-16" target="_blank">G.S. 46-16</a></cite>                        and this section are not applicable to the proceeding.

                    <p>
                        Section Inapplicable. - Respondent claimed the trial court's order was inadequate to support an order for the sale of property under the statute regarding sale in lieu of partition, but that statute did not govern the case, as the applicable statute was
                        regarding the sale of personal property on partition, given the leasehold interests involved. Whitesell v. Barnwell, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 758 S.E.2d 898 (2014).

                        Tenants in common are entitled to actual partition, if it can be made without injury to any of the co-owners. Tayloe v. Carrow, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 6</cite>, 72 S.E. 76 (1911); Horne v. Horne, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 688</cite>,
                        136 S.E.2d 87 (1964). See Gillespie v. Allison, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 542</cite>, 20 S.E. 627 (1894); Seawell v. Seawell, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 735</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 369 (1951); Batts v. Gaylord, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 181</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Prima facie, a tenant in common is entitled, as a matter of right, to partition of the lands so that he may enjoy his share in severalty. If, however, an actual partition cannot be made without injury to some or all of the parties interested, he is equally
                        entitled to a partition by sale. Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 553 (1966).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because land owned as joint tenants in common could be partitioned without materially impairing either co-tenant's rights, a trial court erred by ordering a sale of the land; <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.046.html#t46a02s46-22" target="_blank">G.S. 46-22</a></cite>                        required a partition in kind as opposed to a sale in such circumstances. Lyons-Hart v. Hart, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 232, 695 S.E.2d 818 (2010).

                    <p>
                        And Partition in Kind Is Favored over Sale. - A tenant in common is entitled, as a matter of right, to a partition in kind if it can be accomplished equitably. That is to say, partition in kind is favored over sale of the land for division. Phillips v.
                        Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 246 S.E.2d 41, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 647</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 252 (1978).

                    <p>
                        The burden is on the party seeking sale for partition to show the necessity therefor, and where sale for partition is decreed by the court without hearing evidence or finding facts to show the right to sell, the cause will be remanded. Wolfe v. Galloway,
                        <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 361</cite>, 190 S.E. 213 (1937); Seawell v. Seawell, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 735</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 369 (1951).

                    <p>
                        The burden is upon those alleging the necessity and desirability of a sale to establish the necessary requisites. Brown v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 577 (1965).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The burden is on him who seeks a sale in lieu of actual partition to allege and prove the facts upon which the order of sale must rest. Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 553 (1966).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The burden is upon those opposing a partition in kind to establish the necessity of a sale. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 246 S.E.2d 41, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 647</cite>,
                        248 S.E.2d 252 (1978).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The party seeking a partition by sale must show substantial injustice or material impairment of his rights or position such that the value of his share of the real property would be materially less on actual partition than if the land were sold and the
                        tenants were paid according to their respective shares. Whatley v. Whatley, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 484 S.E.2d 420 (1997).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fact that a tenant in common is entitled to a homestead against the judgment cannot prevent a sale for partition. Holley v. White, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 77</cite>, 89 S.E. 1061 (1916).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A sale will not be ordered merely for the convenience of one of the cotenants. Brown v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 577 (1965).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Proof of Injury to Cotenant Must Be Shown. - In the absence of any allegation, proof or finding that an actual partition cannot be had without injury to some or all of the parties, the court has no jurisdiction to order a sale. Seawell v. Seawell,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">233 N.C. 735</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 369 (1951).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Court Without Jurisdiction to Order Sale. - The court has no authority to order a sale of land for partition without satisfactory proof of facts showing that an actual partition will cause injury to some or all of the cotenants. Brown v. Boger,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 577 (1965).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By "injury" to a cotenant is meant substantial injustice or material impairment of his rights or position, such that it would be unconscionable to require him to submit to actual partition. Brown v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>,
                        139 S.E.2d 577 (1965); Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 246 S.E.2d 41, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 647</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 252 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Test Is Whether Value of Share Would Be Materially Less on Partition Than on Sale. - The test of whether a partition in kind would result in great prejudice to the cotenant owners is whether the value of the share of each in case of a partition would
                        be materially less than the share of each in the money equivalent that could probably be obtained for the whole. Brown v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 577 (1965); Phillips
                        v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 246 S.E.2d 41, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 647</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 252 (1978).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Determinative Circumstances. - On the question of partition or sale, the determinative circumstances usually relate to the land itself, and its location, physical condition, quantity, and the like. Brown v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>,
                        139 S.E.2d 577 (1965).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Impairment of Rights of Cotenants Held Insubstantial. - A $2,100.00 diminution in value, or $1,050.00 per cotenant, was not a substantial or material impairment of the rights of the cotenants in property worth $280,000.00, such that an actual partition
                        would be unconscionable. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 246 S.E.2d 41, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 647</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 252 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Effect of Interests of Others. - The owner of an undivided one-half interest in land cannot be denied his rights to have a partition or sale in lieu of partition because of interests which defendants, other than his cotenants, claiming under him, have
                        acquired in and to his undivided interest. Barber v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 711</cite>, 143 S.E. 469 (1928).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Effect of Trust Created by Another Cotenant. - The right of a tenant in common to have the lands sold for a division, under this section, cannot be defeated by a trust creating an interest in the lands by another of the tenants. Barber v. Barber,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">195 N.C. 711</cite>, 143 S.E. 469 (1928).

                    <p>
                        Life Estate Does Not Bar Sale of Reversion or Remainder. - The existence of a life estate is not, per se, a bar to a sale for partition of the remainder or reversion thereof, since, for the purpose of the partition, tenants in common are deemed seized
                        and possessed as if no life estate existed. The actual possession of the life tenant, however, cannot be disturbed so long as it exists. Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>,
                        149 S.E.2d 553 (1966).

                    <p>
                        Whether land should be divided in kind or sold for partition is a question of fact for decision of the clerk of superior court, subject to review by the judge on appeal; it is not an issue of fact for a jury. Brown v. Boger,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">263 N.C. 248</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 577 (1965).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clerk's Role in Partition. - The controverted fact arising on the pleadings as to the advisability of a sale for partition or an actual division was not an issue of fact but a question of fact for the decision of the clerk, subject to review by the judge
                        on appeal. Ledbetter v. Piner, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 455</cite>, 27 S.E. 123 (1897); Vanderbilt v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. 273</cite>, 78 S.E. 156 (1913).

                    <p>
                        Proof of Injury to Cotenant Must Be Shown. - Whether or not, in a proceeding instituted under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.046.html#t46a01s46-3" target="_blank">G.S. 46-3</a></cite> for partition of the land of
                        tenants in common, there shall be an actual partition or sale for partition involves a question of fact to be determined by the court. In such proceedings, an allegation that the land is incapable of actual division without injury
                        to some or all of the tenants in common raises a question of fact for the trial judge, and not an issue of fact for the jury, and the judge has the power to order a sale for partition. Barber v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 711</cite>,
                        143 S.E.2d 469 (1928).

                    <p>
                        The court must find the facts required by this section in order to support a decree of sale for partition. Priddy &amp; Co. v. Sanderford, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 422</cite>, 20 S.E.2d 341 (1942).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Failure of Court to Make Required Findings. - Where the trial court failed to make the findings of fact required by this section for partition by sale, that actual partition would result in one cotenant's share having less value than the share he would
                        receive were the property partitioned by sale, and that actual partition would materially impair a cotenant's rights, since there was also no evidence in the record which would support such findings, the trial court's order of
                        partition by sale was reversed. Partin v. Dalton Property Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 807, 436 S.E.2d 903 (1993).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an action seeking the sale of land for partition, when a trial court did not make the findings enumerated in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.046.html#t46a02s46-22ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 46-22(b)</a></cite> and
                        (c), it was nonetheless proper to grant the petition because the party against whom the proceeding was filed made judicial admissions before the clerk of the trial court, and on review before the trial court that an actual partition
                        of the land was not possible without substantial injury to the interested parties and failed to deny such allegations in the petition, so such findings were unnecessary. Sheffer v. Rardin, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite>                        620, 704 S.E.2d 32 (2010).

                    <p>
                        Reversal and remand were necessary because a trial court erred in its determination that an actual partition of the parcels could not be made without causing substantial injury to one or more of the interested parties as the court failed to make the specific
                        findings of fact necessary to support an order for partition by sale of the parcels. Particularly, the court failed to make specific findings of fact as to the value of each individual parcel and the value of each share of certain
                        parcels were those parcels physically partitioned. Solesbee v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 603, 805 S.E.2d 183 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Conclusive Effect of Findings of Trial Judge. - The findings of the trial judge with regard to whether there should be a partition in kind or sale are conclusive and binding if supported by competent evidence; the judge has discretion in making the determination,
                        and his decision will not be disturbed absent some error of law. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 246 S.E.2d 41, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 647</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Right of Wife of Cotenant to Resist Partition. - The wife of a tenant in common has an interest in his portion of the lands or the proceeds of the sale thereof, for division, contingent upon her surviving him, and is a proper party to the proceedings
                        for partition, under this section or <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.046.html#t46a01s46-3" target="_blank">G.S. 46-3</a></cite>, with the right to be heard when the lands are sold for division,
                        in order to protect her contingent interests in the proceeds of the sale. But she cannot resist the plaintiff's right to a partition nor challenge the power of the court to order sale for partition. Barber v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 711</cite>,

                        A wife having a dower interest in property held by her husband as tenant in common could not defeat a sale for partition. Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 292</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 853 (1939).

                        Purchase of Land by Tenant in Common. - A tenant in common suing to partition the premises controlled by him as agent for the cotenants cannot, on being appointed commissioner to sell the premises, purchase them at the sale or procure anyone to do it
                        for him, and he cannot speculate for his own benefit or do any act detrimental to the interest of his cotenants. Tuttle v. Tuttle, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 484</cite>, 59 S.E. 1008 (1907). See also,
                        Credle v. Baugham, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 18</cite>, 67 S.E. 46 (1910).

                    <p>
                        Interest of Trust Beneficiaries Attaches to Proceeds. - The interest of the beneficiaries under a deed of trust upon the interest of a tenant in common in land will, upon its sale under this section, attach to the proceeds and be fully protected in the
                        final judgment or order in the proceedings. Barber v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 711</cite>, 143 S.E. 469 (1928).

                    <p>
                        Determination of Claims Before Distribution. - A defendant who asserted his claims before an order of distribution was made was entitled as a matter of right to have his claims determined before an order of distribution of the proceeds of the sale was
                        entered. Roberts v. Barlowe, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 239</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 483 (1963).

                    <p>
                        No Waiver of Right to Partition. - Evidence supported the trial court's finding that there was no written agreement between the husband and wife concerning their rights in certain property, and there was no particular conduct or action taken by either
                        party affecting ownership of the property or the husband's right to seek partition of the property at a later date; no implied-in-fact contract was ever formed between the parties that would have made the wife the sole owner of
                        the property or waived the husband's right to seek partition. Ward v. Ward, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 253, 797 S.E.2d 525 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Appellate Review. - The action of a judge of the superior court in setting aside the report of partition commissioners advising actual partition and ordering a sale is not reviewable, unless an error of law was committed. Albemarle Steam Nav. Co. v. Wovell,
                        <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 93</cite>, 45 S.E. 466 (1903); Tayloe v. Carrow, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 6</cite>, 72 S.E. 76 (1911).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since a tenant in common has the right to actual partition unless it is made to appear by satisfactory proof that actual partition cannot be made without injury to some or all of the parties interested, an order for sale for partition affects a substantial
                        right, and an appeal will lie to the Supreme Court from such order entered by the judge on appeal from the clerk. Hyman v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 342</cite>, 7 S.E.2d 700 (1940).

                        Relationship to Bankruptcy Law. - In finding that judicial economy favored partition of co-owned property as part of debtor's <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> case rather
                        than through North Carolina state court proceeding that had yet to be initiated, court noted that debtor could immediately market property and court could consider private or public proposed sale upon only 21 days' notice to parties
                        in interest, but delay in state court could be compounded because it could require mediation before making determination of sale and, once judicial sale was ordered, process was far less efficient under state law. Bankruptcy court
                        liquidated property on routine basis with little or no delay and was empowered by Congress with avenues to accomplish reasonable and efficient liquidation of assets. In re Guy, 587 B.R. 475 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2018).

                <p>
                    Any cotenant entering the high bid or offer at any sale of one hundred percent (100%) of the undivided interests in any parcel of real property shall receive a credit for the undivided interest the cotenant already owns in the real property and shall
                    receive a corresponding reduction in the amount of the total purchase price owed after deducting the costs and fees associated with the sale and allocating the costs and fees associated with the sale in accordance with the orders of
                    the court. The high bid or offer shall be for one hundred percent (100%) of the undivided interests in the parcel of real property sold, and the credit and reduction shall be applied at the time of the closing of the cotenant's purchase
                    of the real property. When two or more cotenants jointly make the high bid or offer at the sale, they may receive at the closing an aggregate credit and reduction in the amount of the total purchase price representing the total of
                    their undivided interests in the real property. Any credits and reductions allowed by this subsection shall be further adjusted to reflect any court-ordered adjustments to the share of the net sale proceeds of each of the cotenants
                    entering the high bid or offer, including, but not limited to, equitable adjustments to the share of the net sales proceeds due to a court finding of the lack of contribution of one or more cotenants to the payment of carrying costs
                    or improvements of the real property under G.S. 46A-27.

                <p>
                    If the real property to be partitioned by sale is subject to a life estate, a life tenant who joins in the proceeding shall receive the value of the life tenant's share calculated according to mortality tables accepted by the court and paid out of the
                    proceeds to the life tenant. The owners of the remainder or reversionary interest have no interest in this payment to the life tenant.

                        of the family were entitled to partition of the home place among remaindermen as directed by will, where they showed the court that they no longer desired to retain it as a home, since the life tenants could waive the right if

                        Rule Before Section Was Adopted. - Before the passage of this section, cotenants in remainder or reversion had no right to enforce a compulsory partition of land in which they had such estate. Gillespie v. Allison, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 542</cite>,
                        20 S.E. 627 (1894); Moore v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 736</cite>, 24 S.E.2d 749 (1943).

                    <p>
                        Prior to passage of this section, partition was permitted between the holder of the life estate and the owner in fee. McEachern v. Gilchrist, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 196</cite> (1876).

                    <p>
                        Rule under this Section. - The existence of a life estate is not, per se, a bar to a sale for partition of the remainder or reversion thereof, since, for the purpose of partition, tenants in common are deemed seized and possessed as if no life estate
                        existed. The actual possession of the life tenant, however, cannot be disturbed so long as it exists. Kayann Properties, Inc. v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 14</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 553 (1966).

                        Section Not Applicable to Life Estate with Power of Sale. - When lands are devised to wife for life, giving her control thereof with power to sell, pay debts, etc., this section does not apply, for if applied it would defeat the very purpose as to powers
                        given the wife. Makely v. Makely, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 121</cite>, 95 S.E. 51 (1918).

                    <p>
                        A power of sale granted to a life tenant by implication creates an exception to the right of partition set out in this section. Keener v. Korn, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 264 S.E.2d 829 (1980).

                    <p>
                        This Section Enlarges Vested Rights. - A statute giving to remaindermen the right to have partition of lands in remainder vested before the passage of such statute is remedial and, instead of impairing, enlarges vested rights. Gillespie v. Allison,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">115 N.C. 542</cite>, 20 S.E. 627 (1894).

                    <p>
                        Application Is Not Limited to Sales. - By the wording of this section, that is, "a sale for partition," followed by the words "purposes of partition," it is apparent that the legislature did not intend to limit the application of the section to sales,
                        and it is to be construed to include actual partition by the remaindermen, as well as for a sale for division by them. Baggett v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 26</cite>, 76 S.E. 86 (1912).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The existence of a life estate, even though it be in favor of one of the tenants in common, does not preclude partition of the remainder among the tenants in common. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 194</cite>, 102
                        S.E.2d 868 (1958).

                    <p>
                        Vested Remaindermen Are Entitled to Partition or Sale. - Since the enactment of this section, the owner of a fee or vested remainder in real estate as a joint tenant or tenant in common is entitled to a partition of the land or sale for partition of the
                        remainder or reversion thereof. But such partition or sale of a vested remainder in real estate shall not interfere with the possession of the life tenant during the existence of his estate. Bunting v. Cobb,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">234 N.C. 132</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 661 (1951).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remainderman petitioner was entitled to partition as a matter of right, unless actual partition could not be made without injury to some or all of the parties interested. In that case, he would be entitled to sale or partition. Richardson v. Barnes,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">238 N.C. 398</cite>, 77 S.E.2d 925 (1953).

                    <p>
                        Proceedings for partition cannot be maintained when plaintiff holds only a contingent interest in the lands, determinable on the death of the life tenant, who is still living at the time. Vinson v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. 653</cite>,
                        75 S.E. 732 (1912).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Possession Need Not Be Actual. - A tenant in common is entitled to a compulsory partition, and to enable said tenant to maintain a proceeding for such partition he must have an estate in possession, or the right of possession. The possession need not
                        be actual. The actual possession may be in a life tenant. Moore v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 736</cite>, 24 S.E.2d 749 (1943). See also, Priddy &amp; Co. v. Sanderford, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 422</cite>,

                    <p>
                        All Parties Interested Must Unite. - A sale for partition will not be decreed when there are contingent remainders or other conditional interests therein unless all the persons who may be by any possibility interested unite in asking such a decree. Aydlett
                        v. Pendleton, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 28</cite>, 16 S.E. 8 (1892); Pendleton v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 248</cite>, 95 S.E. 500 (1918).

                        This section changes the common law and permits a sale of timber for profit, by a life tenant, with the remaindermen receiving their share of the proceeds. At common law the life tenant was not permitted to sell standing timber, nor to receive benefit
                        from it except for ordinary purposes in using the land. Piland v. Piland, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 211 S.E.2d 844, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 723</cite>, 213 S.E.2d
                        723 (1975); Bridgers v. Bridgers, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 617, 289 S.E.2d 921 (1982).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It gives the life tenant an advantage in timber that he does not enjoy in land. Life tenants may not maintain partition proceedings against tenants in common in the remainder. Piland v. Piland, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite>                        653, 211 S.E.2d 844, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 723</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 723 (1975).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Section Is Permissive. - The statute authorizing partition sale of standing timber is permissive rather than mandatory. Chandler v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 62</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 528 (1948).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of the word "may" obviously makes this section permissive. Piland v. Piland, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 211 S.E.2d 844, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 723</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 723 (1975).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Applicability. - This section is not limited in application to only those tracts of land in which interests are subject to a life estate. When this section speaks of tenants in common "either in possession, or in remainder or reversion, subject to a life
                        estate," the phrase "subject to a life estate" modifies only the words "remainder" and "reversion." Tenants in common who presently possess a tract of land may also petition for a sale of timber. Bridgers v. Bridgers,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 617, 289 S.E.2d 921 (1982).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cotenants Need Not Have Same Type of Interest. - This section does not require all cotenants to have the same type of interest in the land. A cotenant in remainder may petition for a sale of standing timber from land in which the other cotenant has a
                        present possessory interest. Bridgers v. Bridgers, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 617, 289 S.E.2d 921 (1982).

                    <p>
                        Showing of Impossibility of Land Partition Is Not Necessary. - Tenants in remainder are not required to show under this section that an equitable partition of land tracts is not possible before the court may authorize a sale of the timber apart from the
                        realty. Bridgers v. Bridgers, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 617, 289 S.E.2d 921 (1982).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Discretion of Court. - Under this section, the court has the power in its discretion to order a sale of timber upon the life tenant's petition. Piland v. Piland, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 211 S.E.2d 844, cert.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prior to the 1975 amendment, this section did not require findings as to necessity and advisability of a sale. Piland v. Piland, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 211 S.E.2d 844, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 723</cite>,

                        Provision in Judgment Requiring Actual Partition of Timber. - Where a tenant in common, without the knowledge or authorization of his cotenants, contracted to sell the timber on the entire tract, and thereafter he joined his cotenants in a timber deed
                        to another person, in an action brought by the grantee in the deed against the vendee in the contract to sell, a provision in the judgment that if the vendee elected to purchase the timber covered by the contract, there should
                        be actual partition of the timber between the vendee and the grantee, would be upheld. Chandler v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 62</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 528 (1948).

                    be borne by one or more of the parties requesting the appraisal in such proportions as determined by the court. Before ruling on the petition brought pursuant to G.S. 46A-83(a)(2)c., the court may in its discretion require written
                    evidence from the appraiser that the appraiser has been paid in full for the appraisal. If based on the appraisal and all of the evidence presented, the court finds the amount bid or price offered to be inadequate, inequitable, and

                        Application by Judgment Creditors for Share of Proceeds. - Since they are not affected by the partition sale, judgment creditors, who are not parties to the partition proceeding, have no right to apply to the court after final decree to have their debtor's
                        share of the proceeds paid to them. Moreover, they cannot be permitted to intervene for such purpose after the officer or person making the partition sale has put an end to the proceeding by disposing of the proceeds of sale in
                        conformity with the final decree. Washburn v. Washburn, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 370</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 264 (1951).

                        The appropriate procedure for a tenant in common seeking a division of personal property is to file a petition in the superior court for that purpose pursuant to this section. Parslow v. Parslow, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite>                        84, 266 S.E.2d 746 (1980).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exclusiveness of Remedy. - A petition for the partition of personal property is the only remedy one tenant in common has against another for withholding possession. Powell v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 169</cite> (1870);
                        Grim v. Wicker, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 343</cite> (1879).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One tenant in common or joint owner of personal property cannot maintain an action against the other tenant or owner to recover the exclusive possession of the property when the defendant forcibly took it from the plaintiff's possession; the plaintiff's
                        only remedy is to have the property partitioned. Thompson v. Silverthorne, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 12</cite>, 54 S.E. 782 (1906).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Injunction or Receiver. - Where, pending a suit for partition of personal property, the defendant threatens the destruction or removal of the property, the court, on the plaintiff's application, may grant an injunction or appoint a receiver. Thompson
                        v. Silverthorne, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 12</cite>, 54 S.E. 782 (1906).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Title to Personalty. - In petitions for the partition of personal property owned in common, where the defendant sets up title in severalty in himself, the title to the property may be tried on the petition. Edwards v. Bennett,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">32 N.C. 361</cite> (1849).
                            <br />

                    <p>
                        Venue. - A proceeding for the partition of personal property is the sole remedy of a tenant in common to obtain possession as against a cotenant, and therefore it is governed by the provisions of G.S. 1-76(4), making the venue the county in which the
                        property sought to be partitioned is located, and not the county of the residence of the petitioner or respondent. Dubose v. Harpe, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 672</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 454 (1954).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Notes. - The owners of notes, as tenants in common, are entitled to partition. Central Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 678</cite>, 143 S.E. 252 (1928).

                        the sale of personal property on partition, given the leasehold interests involved. Whitesell v. Barnwell, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 758 S.E.2d 898 (2014).
