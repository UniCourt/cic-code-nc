                </h3>
                <p>
                    The General Assembly finds and declares that the office of sheriff, the office of deputy sheriff and the other officers and employees of the sheriff of a county are unique among all of the law-enforcement offices of North Carolina. The administration
                    of criminal justice has been declared by Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.017C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 17C</a></cite> of the General Statutes to be of statewide concern to the people
                    of the State. The sheriff is the only officer of local government required by the Constitution. The sheriff, in addition to his criminal justice responsibilities, is the only officer who is also responsible for the courts of the State,
                    and acting as their bailiff and marshall. The sheriff administers and executes criminal and civil justice and acts as the ex officio detention officer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The deputy sheriff has been held by the Supreme Court of this State to hold an office of special trust and confidence, acting in the name of and with powers coterminous with his principal, the elected sheriff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The offices of sheriff and deputy sheriff are therefore of special concern to the public health, safety, welfare and morals of the people of the State. The training and educational needs of such officers therefore require particularized and differential
                    treatment from those of the criminal justice officers certified under Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.017C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 17C</a></cite> of the General Statutes.

                    in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.017E.html" target="_blank">Chapter 17E</a></cite> of the General Statutes, as amended by this act, may rearrange sentences that currently appear within subsections.
                    The Revisor may modify statutory citations throughout the General Statutes, as appropriate, and may modify any references to statutory divisions, such as "Chapter," "Subchapter," "Article," "Part," "section," and "subsection"; adjust
                    the order of lists of multiple statutes to maintain statutory order; correct terms and conform names and titles changed by this act; and make conforming changes to catch lines and references to catch lines. The Revisor may also adjust
                    subject and verb agreement and the placement of conjunctions. The Revisor shall consult with the North Carolina Sheriffs' Education and Training Standards Commission on this recodification."

                    <p>
                        Sheriff's Department is Local Governmental Entity. - In the injured party's suit against a sheriff and individual detention officers arising out of a five-day episode in the county detention center where she alleged that they ignored her requests for
                        medical treatment, the trial court properly concluded that the office of North Carolina sheriff was a "person" under 42 U.S.C.S.
                        <span class="s1">
    ยง
   </span> 1983 because: (1) the state constitution created the office of sheriff, N.C. Const. art. VII,
                        <span class="s1">
    ยง
   </span> 2, but included that provision within the article governing local governments, along with provisions for counties, cities, towns, and other governmental subdivisions, N.C. Const. art. VII,
                        <span class="s1">
    ยง
   </span> 1; (2) state statutes, including G.S. 17E-1, 160A-288.2, 143-166.50, and 97-2, characterized a sheriff's department as a local governmental entity; (3) there was no contention that the State would be potentially liable
                        for any monetary judgment entered against the sheriff and the detention officers; and (4) the State did not have, with respect to a sheriff, the minimum degree of control required for Eleventh Amendment immunity. Boyd v. Robeson
                        County, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 621 S.E.2d 1 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 629</cite>, 615 S.E.2d 866 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Deputy Sheriffs. - In light of the distinct demarcation between county government and the office of the sheriff, a sheriff's office is not a program or department of a county, and a deputy sheriff or employee of a sheriff's office is not a county employee.
                        Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).

        Termination for Political Reasons.
       </b> - In North Carolina, deputy sheriffs may be lawfully terminated for political reasons; the office of deputy sheriff is that of policy maker, and the deputy sheriff is an alter ego of the sheriff generally. Jenkins v.
                        Medford, 119 F.3d 1156 (4th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1090, 118 S. Ct. 881, 139 L. Ed. 2d 869 (1998).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Deputy sheriff's free speech rights were not violated because mutual confidence and loyalty between a sheriff and a deputy were crucial in accomplishing the sheriff's policies and duties; thus, the deputy could be lawfully terminated for political reasons
                        under the exception to prohibited political terminations; by standing in the elected sheriff's shoes, a deputy sheriff fills a role in which loyalty to the elected sheriff is necessary to ensure that the sheriff's policies are
                        carried out. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).
