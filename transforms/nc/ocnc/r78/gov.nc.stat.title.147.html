                    shall commence on the first day of January next after their election and continue until their successors are elected and qualified. The persons having the highest number of votes, respectively, shall be declared duly elected, but if

      </b> - An amendment to this section in Session Laws 1981, c. 504, s. 7, was made effective upon certification of approval of the constitutional amendments proposed by ss. 1 through 3 of the 1981 act. The constitutional amendments
                    were submitted to the people at an election held June 29, 1982, and were defeated. Therefore, the 1981 amendment to this section never went into effect.

                    <p>
                        The Governor has the duty to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers. The constitutional independence of the executive offices, and their differing functions and duties, create clear potential for conflict between their respective holders.
                        In the event of such conflict, power in the Attorney General to resolve, without their consent, controversies involving agencies or departments under the supervision of the Governor, could be abused by exercise in a manner effectively
                        derogative of the Governor's constitutional duties to exercise executive power and to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers. The General Assembly, in the enactment of G.S. 114-2(2), did not intend to create such
                        potential. Tice v. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 48, 312 S.E.2d 241 (1984).

                    In any case in which the Governor is authorized by the Constitution to grant a pardon he may, upon the petition of the prisoner, grant it, subject to such conditions, restrictions, and limitations as he considers proper and necessary, and he may issue

                    shall order him remanded and confined for the unexpired term of his sentence; said confinement, if the prisoner is under any other sentence of imprisonment at the time of said order, to begin upon expiration of such sentence. In computing
                    the period of his confinement the time between the conditional pardon and subsequent arrest shall not be taken to be a part of the time of his sentence. If it appears to the Governor that he has not broken the conditions of his conditional
                    pardon he shall be released and his conditional pardon shall remain in force.

                        Right to Grant Conditional Pardon. - The Governor may grant a pardon upon a condition precedent that the prisoner pay the costs of trial, and upon condition subsequent, that he remain of good character and be sober and industrious. Ex parte Williams,
                        <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 436</cite>, 63 S.E. 108 (1908).

                    <p>
                        Conditions Must Not Be Illegal, Immoral or Impossible. - Power of the Governor to grant a conditional pardon is generally subject to the limitation that the conditions imposed must not be illegal, immoral or impossible of performance, which limitation
                        does not apply to cases wherein the prisoner is only required not to violate the statute law and to remain of good conduct. State v. Yates, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 753</cite>, 111 S.E. 337 (1922).

                    <p>
                        Conditional Pardon Irrevocable Unless Conditions Are Violated. - A pardon with conditions precedent and subsequent is irrevocable after delivery and acceptance, upon compliance by the prisoner with the condition precedent, unless he violates the conditions
                        subsequent by his conduct after release. Ex parte Williams, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 436</cite>, 63 S.E. 108 (1908).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Pardon Voided by Breach of Conditions. - Where prisoner has accepted his freedom upon the terms of a conditional pardon from the Governor, his breach of such conditions voids the pardon and cancels his right to further immunity from punishment. State
                        v. Yates, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 753</cite>, 111 S.E. 337 (1922).

                    <p>
                        Rearrest for Violation of Conditions. - Under the provisions of the State Constitution and statutes, a "parole" granted by the Governor to a prisoner imports a conditional pardon, and the Governor may cause his rearrest either upon his own admissions,
                        or on such evidence as he may require, for violating the conditions which the prisoner has accepted under the terms of the parole. State v. Yates, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 753</cite>, 111 S.E. 337
                        (1922).

                    <p>
                        The essential part of a sentence for a violation of the criminal law is punishment for the offense committed, and not the time the sentence shall begin and end; and where a prisoner has accepted a conditional pardon from the Governor and has obtained
                        his freedom, the breaking of the condition after the term would have otherwise expired affords no legal excuse why he should not be recommitted to serve out the balance of his sentence. State v. Yates,
                        <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 753</cite>, 111 S.E. 337 (1922).

                        A pardoned prior conviction may not be considered as an aggravating factor during sentencing absent revocation of the pardon by the governor. State v. Clifton, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 481 S.E.2d 393, cert.
                        granted, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 182</cite>, 486 S.E.2d 200, discretionary review improvidently allowed, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 391</cite>, 493 S.E.2d 56 (1997).

                    <p>
                        The reasoning that an increased punishment for a current offense due to a prior pardoned conviction is not punishment for the prior pardoned offense is a legal fiction that conflicts with logic and the administrative duties of the governor; thus, trial
                        court infringed upon the prerogatives of the governor by finding that defendant's prior conviction constituted an aggravating factor. State v. Clifton, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 481
                        S.E.2d 393, cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 182</cite>, 486 S.E.2d 200, discretionary review improvidently allowed, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 391</cite>, 493 S.E.2d 56 (1997).

                    The General Assembly is ultimately responsible for authorizing the expenditure of public moneys, designating the sources from which moneys may be collected, and shaping the administrative structure to perform the work of government throughout the State,
                    and is held finally accountable for how the funds are spent and what is accomplished with them. The legislature should, therefore, provide the basic direction for audits of State agencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the interest of reducing audit overlap and expense at all levels of government, the General Assembly and the Auditor should promote, to the extent possible, coordinated nonduplicating audits of public programs and activities of all governmental levels
                    throughout the State.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the intent of this Article that all State agencies, and entities supported, partially or entirely, by public funds be subject to audit under the policy guidance of the Auditor. Such audits shall be made to assist in furnishing the General Assembly,
                    the Governor, the executive departments and agencies of the State, the governing bodies and executive departments of the political subdivisions of the State, and the public in general with an independent evaluation of public program
                    performance.

                        The Treasurer is not required to pay every warrant which the Auditor may sign, but only those which are legally drawn, and the fact that the Auditor finds that a claim for which he issues a warrant on the Treasurer is authorized by law is not binding
                        upon or a protection to the latter. Commercial &amp; Farmers' Bank v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 146</cite>, 23 S.E. 160 (1895).

                        Treasurer Has No Right to Pay Out Money Except on Proper Warrants. - As it is the duty of the State Treasurer to keep his accounts, showing the transactions of each fiscal year ending December 31, he has no right to pay out money except upon proper warrants
                        drawn upon the proper funds in the treasury. Arendell v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 111</cite>, 34 S.E. 232 (1899).

                    <p>
                        Use of mandamus to compel action by State Treasurer. - Where the State Treasurer denies the correctness of a claim audited by the State Auditor and alleges fraud in the creation of the indebtedness or that the services for which a warrant was issued were
                        not rendered, mandamus will not lie to compel him to pay it, the question raised by such claim being for the legislature, and not the courts, to determine. Garner v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 250</cite>,
                        29 S.E. 364 (1898).

                        Refusing to Pay a Claim Where No Warrant Has Been Issued. - Mandamus will not lie to compel the Treasurer to pay a claim where the Auditor has not issued a warrant therefor, as the Treasurer can only pay on such warrant. Burton v. Furnam,

                    <p>
                        Treasurer is entitled to a mandamus to enforce the drawing of proper warrants upon the proper funds before paying them, as they are his vouchers. Arendell v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 111</cite>, 34 S.E. 232 (1899).

                    <p>
                        The courts cannot direct the State Treasurer to pay a claim against the State, however just and unquestioned, when there is no legislative appropriation to pay the same; and when there is such an appropriation, the coercive power is applied not to compel
                        payment of the State liability, but to compel a public servant to discharge his duty by obedience to a legislative enactment. Garner v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 250</cite>, 29 S.E. 364 (1898).

                        Refund of Taxes. - The State Treasurer is responsible for the efficient and faithful exercise of the responsibilities of his office, including refunding taxes erroneously collected. Bailey v. State, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 227</cite>,
                        412 S.E.2d 295 (1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 911, 112 S. Ct. 1942, 118 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1992), overruled on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 130</cite>, 500 S.E.2d 54 (1998).

                        or by G.S. 105-267 [repealed] to order the refund of an invalid or illegal tax, since questions of constitutionality are for the courts. Bailey v. State, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 227</cite>, 412 S.E.2d

                    protect the State from loss. The State Treasurer shall, before making deposits in any bank or savings and loan association, require ample security from the bank or savings and loan association for these deposits.

                <p>
                    "The Office of State Budget and Management shall ensure the savings from any authorized agreement shall be included in the IT Internal Service Fund rate calculations before approving annual proposed rates. Any savings resulting from the agreements shall

                <p>
                    A State agency to which an account receivable is owed is responsible for collecting the account receivable. In fulfilling this responsibility, a State agency shall establish internal policies and procedures for the management and collection of accounts
                    receivable and shall submit its internal policies and procedures to the State Controller for review.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The State Controller shall examine the policies and procedures submitted by a State agency to determine whether they are consistent with statewide policies and procedures adopted by the State Controller. The statewide policies and procedures shall ensure
                    that a State agency takes all cost-effective and appropriate actions to collect accounts receivable owed to it. If the State Controller determines that a State agency's policies and procedures are not consistent with the statewide
                    policies and procedures, the State Controller shall discuss the inconsistencies with the State agency to determine whether special circumstances, such as a requirement of federal law, justify the inconsistencies. If the State Controller,
                    after consulting with the Office of the Attorney General, finds that no special circumstances justify the inconsistencies, the State Controller shall notify the State agency and the State agency shall conform its policies and procedures
                    to the statewide policies and procedures. If the State Controller finds that special circumstances justify the inconsistencies, the State agency's internal policies and procedures shall reflect the special circumstances.

                    apply to debts payable to or through the office of a clerk of superior court or a magistrate shall be established with the concurrence of the Administrative Officer of the Courts. The Administrative Officer of the Courts may also establish

                    A condition of payment by electronic payment is receipt by the appropriate State agency of the full amount of the account receivable owed to the State agency. A debtor who pays by electronic payment may be required to pay any fee or charge associated

                    A payment of an account receivable that is made by electronic payment and is not honored by the issuer of the card or the financial institution offering electronic funds transfer does not relieve the debtor of the obligation to pay the account receivable.

                    The State Controller shall negotiate a contract with a third party to perform an audit and collection process of inadvertent overpayments by State agencies to vendors as a result of pricing errors, neglected rebates and discounts, miscalculated freight
                    charges, unclaimed refunds, erroneously paid excise taxes, and related errors. The third party shall be compensated only from funds recovered as a result of the audit. Savings realized in excess of costs shall be transferred from the
                    agency to the Office of State Budget and Management and placed in a special reserve account for future direction by the General Assembly. Any disputed savings shall be settled by the State Controller. This paragraph does not apply
                    to the purchase of medical services by State agencies or payments used to reimburse or otherwise pay for health care services.

                    "Whereas, boycotts and related tactics have become a tool of economic warfare that threaten the sovereignty and security of key allies and trade partners of the United States; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, the State of Israel is the most prominent target of such boycott activity, which began with, but has not been limited to, the Arab League Boycott adopted in 1945, even before Israel's declaration of independence as the reestablished national
                    state of the Jewish people; and

                    "Whereas, Israel in particular is known for its dynamic and innovative approach in many business sectors, and, therefore, a company's decision to discriminate against Israel, Israeli entities, or entities that do business with or in Israel is an unsound
