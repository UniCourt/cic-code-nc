       Community Support Providers Appeals Process.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 2008-107, s. 10.15A(e1)-(e4), as amended by Session Laws 2009-526, s. 2(c), and Session Laws 2009-550, s. 1.1(c), provides: "(e1) For the purpose of expediting the resolution of community support provider appeals and thereby saving State and federal funds that are paid for services that are found to be unnecessary or otherwise ineligible for payment, the Department shall implement on a temporary basis a community support provider appeals process. The process shall be a substitute for informal provider appeals at the Department level and formal provider appeals by the Office of Administrative Hearings. The community support provider appeals process shall apply to a community support services provider:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Who is aggrieved by a decision of the Department to reduce, deny, recoup, or recover reimbursement for community support services, or to deny, suspend, or revoke a provider agreement to provide community support services.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Whose endorsement has been withdrawn or whose application for endorsement has been denied by a local management entity.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(e2) The community support provider appeals process shall be developed and implemented as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) A hearing under this section shall be commenced by filing a petition with the chief hearings clerk of the Department within 30 days of the mailing of the notice by the Department of the action giving rise to the contested case. The petition shall identify the petitioner, be signed by the party or representative of the party, and shall describe the agency action giving rise to the contested case. As used in this section, "file or filing" means to place the paper or item to be filed into the care and custody of the chief hearings clerk of the Department and acceptance thereof by the chief hearings clerk, except that the hearing officer may permit the papers to be filed with the hearing officer, in which event the hearing officer shall note thereon the filing date. The Department shall supply forms for use in these contested cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) If there is a timely request for an appeal, the Department shall promptly designate a hearing officer who shall hold an evidentiary hearing. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing according to applicable federal law and regulations and shall ensure that:
     </p>
     <p>
      "a. Notice of the hearing is given not less than 15 days before the hearing. The notice shall state the date, hour, and place of the hearing and shall be deemed to have been given on the date that a copy of the notice is mailed, via certified mail, to the address provided by the petitioner in the petition for hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      "b. The hearing is held in Wake County, except that the hearing officer may, take testimony and receive evidence by telephone or other electronic means. The petitioner and the petitioner's legal representative may appear before the hearing officer in Wake County.
     </p>
     <p>
      "c. Discovery is no more extensive or formal than that required by federal law and regulations applicable to the hearings. Prior to and during the hearing, a provider representative shall have adequate opportunity to examine the provider's own case file. No later than five days before the date of the hearing, each party to a contested case shall identify each witness that the party intends to call.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The hearing officer shall have the power to administer oaths and affirmations and regulate the conduct of the hearing. The following shall apply to hearings held pursuant to this section:
     </p>
     <p>
      "a. At the hearing, the parties may present such sworn evidence, law, and regulations as are relevant to the issues in the case.
     </p>
     <p>
      "b. The petitioner and the respondent agency each have a right to be represented by a person of his choice, including an attorney obtained at the party's own expense.
     </p>
     <p>
      "c. The petitioner and the respondent agency shall each have the right to cross-examine witnesses as well as make a closing argument summarizing his view of the case and the law.
     </p>
     <p>
      "d. The appeal hearing shall be recorded. If a petition for judicial review is filed the Department shall include a copy of the recording of the hearing as part of the official record. The recording of the appeal hearing may be erased or otherwise destroyed 180 days after the final decision is mailed as provided in G.S. 108A-79(i)(5).
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) The hearing officer shall decide the case based upon a preponderance of the evidence, giving deference to the demonstrated knowledge and expertise of the agency as provided in G.S. 150B-34(a). The hearing officer shall prepare a proposal for the decision, citing relevant law, regulations, and evidence, which shall be served upon the petitioner or the petitioner's representative by certified mail, with a copy furnished to the respondent agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) The petitioner and the respondent agency shall have 15 days from the date of the mailing of the proposal for decision to present written arguments in opposition to or in support of the proposal for decision to the designated official of the Department who will make the final decision. If neither written arguments are presented, nor extension of time granted by the final agency decision maker for good cause, within 15 days of the date of the mailing of the proposal for decision, the proposal for decision becomes final. If written arguments are presented, such arguments shall be considered and the final decision shall be rendered. The final decision shall be rendered not more than 180 days from the date of the filing of the petition. This time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or by final agency decision maker, for good cause shown. The final decision shall be served upon the petitioner or the petitioner's representative by certified mail, with a copy furnished to the respondent agency. In the absence of a petition for judicial review filed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the final decision shall be binding upon the petitioner and the Department.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) A petitioner who is dissatisfied with the final decision of the Department may file, within 30 days of the service of the decision, a petition for judicial review in the Superior Court of Wake County or of the county from which the case arose. The judicial review shall be conducted according to Article 4 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(7) In the event of a conflict between federal law or regulations and State law or regulations, federal law or regulations shall control. This section applies to all petitions that are filed by a Medicaid community support services provider on or after July 1, 2008, and for all Medicaid community support services provider petitions that have been filed at the Office of Administrative Hearings previous to July 1, 2008, but for which a hearing on the merits has not been commenced prior to that date. The requirement that the agency decision must be rendered not more than 180 days from the date of the filing of the petition for hearing shall not apply to (i) community support services provider petitions that were filed at the Office of Administrative Hearings or (ii) requests for a hearing under the Department's informal settlement process prior to the effective date of this act. The Office of Administrative Hearings shall transfer all cases affected by this section to the Department of Health and Human Services within 30 days of the effective date of this section. This act preempts the existing informal appeal process and reconsideration review process at the Department of Health and Human Services and the existing appeal process at the Office of Administrative Hearings with regard to all appeals filed by Medicaid community support services providers under the Medical Assistance program.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(e3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Department of Health and Human Services may, pursuant to its statutory authority or federal Medicaid requirements, suspend the endorsement or Medicaid participation of a provider of community support services pending a final agency decision based on a fair hearing of the provider's appeal filed with the Department under its community support provider appeal process. A provider of community support services whose endorsement, Medicaid participation, or services have been suspended is not entitled to payment during the period the appeal is pending, and the Department shall make no such payment to the provider during that period. If the final agency decision is in favor of the provider, the Department shall remove the suspension, commence payment for provider services, and reimburse the provider for payments withheld during the period of appeal. Contracts between the Department or a local management entity and the provider shall contain a provision indicating the circumstances under which a provider may appeal an agency decision and giving notice of the suspension of payments to the provider while the appeal is pending. This subsection applies to community support provider appeals pending in the Department of Health and Human Services or the Office of Administrative Hearings, as applicable, on and after July 1, 2008.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(e4) The Department's community support provider appeals process established under this section shall expire July 1, 2010. The Department shall report to the House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, the Senate Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services, the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, and the Fiscal Research Division on March 1, 2009, October 1, 2009, and March 1, 2010, on the effectiveness and efficiency of the community support provider appeals process."

     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, Session Laws 1985, c. 746, s. 19, had provided that the act would expire January 1, 1992, and would not be effective on or after that date, but the expiration date was deleted by Session Laws 1991, c. 103, ss. 1 and 2 and Session Laws 1991, c. 689, s. 182.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 1 of Session Laws 1987, c. 827, provided: " The General Statutes are amended by deleting the reference '150A' and substituting the reference '150B' each time it appears."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 1987, c. 536, s. 6 provided that a county ordinance that applies to the Camp Butner reservation on the effective date of the act (July 2, 1987) shall continue to apply until the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources withdraws his approval of the ordinance or the county amends or repeals the ordinance so that it no longer applies to the Camp Butner reservation.

The Codifier of Rules may make changes in the text of the affected rules to reflect changes in organizational structure of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

       Editor's Note. -
   
<span class="s2">

     Most of the cases below were decided under corresponding provisions of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>, or prior to the 1991 amendments to this Chapter.

       History of Chapter.
   
   - The original Administrative Procedure Act (APA), codified as <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>, was effective until Dec. 31, 1985; the APA was rewritten in 1985 and recodified as <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite>, with the new version becoming effective Jan. 1, 1986. Vass v. Board of Trustees, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 423 S.E.2d 796 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1991 Amendment to this section
   
   merely confirms that when a person is aggrieved by agency action, the Administrative Procedure Act only "describes the procedures" for Office of Administrative Hearings review in the event the North Carolina General Assembly vests a party with the right to administrative review, such as a contested case hearing. Empire Power Co. v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 436 S.E.2d 594 (1993), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 569</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 768, reh'g denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 314</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 634 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2003 version of G.S. 150B-34(c),
   
   which excluded the Certificate of Need Act, G.S. 131E-175 et seq., from the requirements of G.S. 150B-36(b), (b1), (b2), (b3), and (d) and G.S. 150B-51, left the scope and standard of review applied under the 1999 version of G.S. 150B-51 undisturbed. Mooresville Hosp. Mgmt. Assocs. v. N.C. HHS, Div. of Facility Servs., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 641, 611 S.E.2d 431 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary purpose of this Act
   
   is to confer procedural rights, including the right to an administrative hearing, upon any person aggrieved by an agency decision, and statutes should be liberally construed together to preserve and effectuate that right. Empire Power Co. v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 569</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 768, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 314</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 634 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The administrative hearing provisions of this act
   
   apply to all agencies and all proceedings except those expressly exempted, and it expressly named the particular agencies exempted therefrom, specifying the extent of each such exemption. Empire Power Co. v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 569</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 768, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 314</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 634 (1994).

      <p>
       Under G.S. 90-270.15(a), the North Carolina Psychology Board is responsible for overseeing licensed psychologists practicing in the state, and it may discipline licensees who violate ethical or professional standards; under G.S. 90-270.15(e), disciplinary actions by the Board are governed by the Administrative Procedure Act,

       Contested case hearing provisions of the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act apply to all agencies and all proceedings except those expressly exempted therefrom, and G.S. 150B-1(e) specifies the extent of each such exemption. N.C. Forestry Ass'n v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 571 S.E.2d 602 (2002), review denied sub nom. N.C. Forestry Ass'n v. N.C.

      <p>
       Although corporations were not required to be represented by attorneys in hearings before the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), pursuant to G.S. 150B-23 (referring to "attorney or representative" of a party), the DMV was exempted from the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act authorizing contested cases to be brought in the OAH, G.S. 150B-1(e)(8), and therefore, in a hearing before the DMV, a corporation was required to be represented by an attorney. In re Twin County Motorsports, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 259, 749 S.E.2d 474 (2013).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Strict Separation of Agency Functions Not Required
   
   - Neither the Administrative Procedure Act, G.S. 150B-1 et seq., nor due process, requires a strict separation between agency functions. Farber v. N.C. Psychology Bd., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 569 S.E.2d 287 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 612</cite>, 574 S.E.2d 679 (2002).

      <p>
       Application of Chapter.
   
   - Where the complaints and notices of hearing were filed prior to Jan. 1, 1986, the action was commenced prior to Jan. 1, 1986, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> had no application; thus, G.S. 150A-45 (rewritten and recodified as G.S. 150B-45), requiring a person seeking review to file a petition in the Superior Court of Wake County, and not G.S. 150B-45, permitting such filing in either Wake County or the county where the person resides, governed. Pinewood Manor Mobile Homes, Inc. v. North Carolina Manufactured Hous. Bd., <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 564, 353 S.E.2d 231, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 674</cite>, 356 S.E.2d 780 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act, G.S. 150B-1 et seq., applied, pursuant to G.S. 150B-1(e), to a county employee's declaratory judgment action for a ruling that the county's personnel regulations were not substantially equivalent to the standards established by the North Carolina State Personnel Act [now the North Carolina Human Resources Act], G.S. 126-1 et seq., where the employee's employment with the county was terminated. Steward v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 131, 657 S.E.2d 719 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       General Assembly did not impliedly exempt the Board of Trustees from the necessity of compliance with APA's rulemaking provisions in adopting a cap factor where G.S. 135-5(a3) and G.S.
   <i>
    135-6(l)
   </i>
   could be harmonized, the adoption of a cap factor was not a ministerial act in which the Board did nothing more than ratify the actuary's recommendation, case law did not support such an implied exemption, and the public interests supported the Board of Education's contention that the cap factor should be established by using the APA's rulemaking provisions to ensure the opportunity for adequate public input before a decision became final. This case was decided prior to the enactment of G.S. 150B-1(d)(30) by Session Laws 2020-48, s. 4.1(c). Cabarrus Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Dep't of State Treasurer, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 3</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 814 (2020).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Individuals aggrieved pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act
   
   are not required to seek administrative review in a contested case hearing before the Office of Administrative Hearings via the contested case hearing provisions of this act; rather, they are entitled to a hearing governed by procedures established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, P.L.102-569, 42 U.S.C.

       Direct Challenge to Constitutionality of North Carolina Supreme Court Order.
   
   - A direct challenge of the constitutionality of an order of the North Carolina Supreme Court cannot be adjudicated under this Chapter. The issue must be litigated as an original action in the General Court of Justice. Beard v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 126</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 694 (1987).

      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial Notice of Regulations.
   
   - Where promulgating agency is not subject to the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act, the court is only required to take judicial notice of its regulations if they are submitted in accordance with certain procedures designed to insure their accuracy.

       Department of Insurance.
   
   - Insurance Commissioner's promulgation of 11 N.C.A.C. 12.0319, prohibiting subrogation provisions in life or accident and health insurance contracts, supported by G.S. 58-2-40 (right to limit practices injurious to the public) and 58-50-15(a) (prohibiting provisions less favorable to the insured), did not exceed his statutory authority, even though it may change state substantive law, and did not amount to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers, because statutory provisions (G.S. 58-2-40, 58-51-15, and 58-50-15) and judicial review (available under this chapter) offer adequate procedural safeguards and support the delegation of power to the Commissioner. In re A Declaratory Ruling by the N.C. Comm'r of Ins. Regarding 11 N.C.A.C. 12.0319, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C.

       Department of Transportation.
   
   - Language which provides that Articles 2 and 3 of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite> shall not apply to the Department of Transportation in rule-making or administrative hearings only applies to actions taken by the department pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html" target="_blank">Chapter 20</a></cite>, which refers to regulation of motor vehicles. In contrast, Chapters 136 and 143B provide the Department of Transportation and the Board of Transportation with powers and duties to engage in the planning and construction of the state highway system, and had the General Assembly wanted to exclude actions of the Department and Board of Transportation under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.136.html" target="_blank">Chapter 136</a></cite> from the requirements of Articles 2 and 3 of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>, it would have done so with the same specificity that it used in excluding actions taken pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html" target="_blank">Chapter 20</a></cite>. Orange County Sensible Hwys. &amp; Protected Env'ts, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 265 S.E.2d 890 (1980).

      <p>
       University of North Carolina's State Residency Committee (SRC)
   
   is exempt from this Chapter; therefore, although provisions in the act requiring judicial review of final administrative review were applicable, the SRC was not governed by G.S. 150B-36, which requires agencies to state reasons for their decisions. Wilson v. State Residence Comm., <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 374 S.E.2d 415 (1988), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 252</cite>, 377 S.E.2d 764 (1989).

      <p>
       Board of Trustees.
   
   - Language in G.S. 135-39.7 [now G.S. 135-44.7] that board of trustees "may make a binding decision" concerning a dispute between an aggrieved individual and a claims administrator of a medical plan is not an express and unequivocal exemption of the board from the requirements of this Chapter; instead, the use of the term "binding" in the statute was intended to mean only that the board's decision would be binding upon the parties absent further review according to law. Vass v. Board of Trustees, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 402</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 26 (1989).

      <p>
       Retirement Systems Division of the Department of State Treasurer (Division) erred in invoicing a school employee or school board for contributions to the employee's retirement fund pursuant to a statutory cap factor because (1) the factor was a rule not properly adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, and (2) the Division was a state agency not exempt from rule making requirements. Cabarrus Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Dep't of State Treasurer, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C.

       The Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources (now the Department of Environment and Natural Resources),

       Where taxpayer only argued in his brief that decision by board was unsupported by substantial evidence
   
   in view of the "whole record" test, the Court of Appeals would decline to review the board's decision under the other standards of this section. Walls &amp; Marshall Fuel Co. v. North Carolina Dep't of Revenue, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 381 S.E.2d 815 (1989).

        Challenges to Constitutionality of Regulation or Statute.
       </b>
       - Under North Carolina law, plaintiffs may be able to bypass administrative review and seek direct relief from the court. For example, when an aggrieved party challenges the constitutionality of a regulation or statute, administrative remedies are deemed to be inadequate and exhaustion thereof is not required. Prentiss v. Allstate Ins. Co., 87 F. Supp. 2d 514 (W.D.N.C. 1999).

       Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance
   
   - Pursuant to G.S. 150B-1(c), the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance, is an Article 3 agency and thereby subject to the mandates of G.S. 150B-44. Albemarle Mental Health Ctr. v. N.C. Dep't of HHS, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 582 S.E.2d 651 (2003), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 134</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 519 (2004).

       Dialysis firm challenging the refusal of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Division of Facility Services [now the Division of Health Service Regulation], Medical Facilities Planning Section, to amend a Semiannual Dialysis Report (SDR) did not have a remedy under the North Carolina Administrative Procedures Act or the North Carolina Declaratory Judgment Act since, inter alia: the enabling statute suggested that the North Carolina State Medical Facilities Plan (SMFP), which contained the SDR, was a snapshot in time intended to enable the DHHS to develop policy, criteria, and standards for health service facilities planning; and it was the role of the DHHS and the N.C. State Health Coordinating Council to develop the SMFP. Bio-Medical Applications of N.C. Inc. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C.

       State Board of Education.
   
   - By the 1942 amendment to the North Carolina Constitution, the framers and voters consolidated in the State Board of Education all administrative authority governing a statewide public school system, limited the Board's authority to making rules and regulations subject to laws enacted by the General Assembly, eliminated the Board's authority to legislate, and thereby restored to the General Assembly all legislative authority regarding public education.

      <p>
       Process of Approval Or Disapproval Of Execution Protocol Not Subject To the Administrative Procedure Act.
   
   - Superior court did not err in dismissing inmates' request for judicial review of the final decision of respondent North Carolina Council of State, which approved the lethal injection protocol the Department of Correction (DOC) submitted, because the process by which the Council approved or disapproved the DOC's lethal injection protocol was not subject to the APA, and the inmates could not challenge it by going through the Office of Administrative Hearings through the APA; instead, any issue the inmates had with the protocol rested with the General Court of Justice or the federal courts. Conner v. N.C. Council of State, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 242</cite>, 716 S.E.2d 836 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       General Assembly intended that the Department of Correction (DOC) have primary responsibility for the lethal injection process because G.S. 15-188 does not give the North Carolina Council of State authority beyond merely approving or disapproving the submitted protocol; the General Assembly did not intend to negate the express exemption that it provided to the DOC in the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by including a requirement that the Council approve the lethal injection protocol, and thus, the process by which the Council approves or disapproves the DOC's lethal injection protocol is not subject to the APA. Conner v. N.C. Council of State, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 242</cite>, 716 S.E.2d 836 (2011).

       Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.
   
   - Trial court properly dismissed a former police officer's negligence action against a drug testing laboratory for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the officer failed to exhaust all administrative remedies under the North Carolina Administrative Procedures Act, G.S. 150B et seq., by not requesting an administrative hearing, pursuant to G.S. 17C-11(b), to contest the decision by the North Carolina Criminal Justice Education and Training Standards Commission to suspend the officer's law enforcement certification upon the officer's positive drug test.

       Applicability of G.S. 150B-23(a).
   
   - Section 150B-23(a), as amended by Session Laws 1987, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.878.html" target="_blank">Chapter 878</a></cite>, is not applicable to agencies governed by Article 3A of this Chapter.

       from adverse decisions of county agencies or boards are governed by the substantive provisions and procedural requirements of G.S. 108A-79, including the procedural provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act consistent with the statute, to the extent that substance and procedure are not in conflict with applicable federal law and regulations.

      <p>
       <b>
        Procedural, Not Substantive, Provisions of Act Applicable to Appeals of County Agency Decisions.
       </b>
       - Given the detailed substantive provisions of G.S. 108A-79, designed specifically to apply to appeals of county agency decisions, and the fact that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), by its terms, does not apply to such appeals, the Legislature, by reference to the APA, did not intend to substitute the Act's substantive requirements for those of G.S. 108A-79. The citation to the APA simply indicates a legislative intent to incorporate the powers of hearing officers and the hearing procedures detailed in the Act into G.S. 108A-79(i) by reference.

       <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.078A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 78A</a></cite> Does Not Take Precedence over This Act.
   
   - The provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.078A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 78A</a></cite> are not stated with the specificity and particularity sufficient to take precedence over any similar provisions of this Chapter which might conceivably apply to the actions and proceedings addressed by the Securities Act.

       This Chapter applies to the Secretary of State in the execution of the duties delegated in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.078A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 78A</a></cite>.
   
   To be entirely exempt from this Chapter under subsection (c) of this section, the agency must either be listed in subsection (d) or have a specific statement of exemption from this Chapter in its enabling legislation; however, neither basis for exemption exists for <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.078A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 78A</a></cite>. Subsection (c) does have the additional effect of causing any applicable provisions of this Chapter which cannot be reconciled with provisions of Chapter 78A to fail in favor of Chapter 78A.

The Revisor was further authorized to make additional technical and conforming changes to catchlines, internal citations, and other references throughout the General Statutes to effectuate this recodification. Pursuant to this authority, the Revisor of Statutes substituted "Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement" for "State Board of Elections" in sub-subdivision (8a)b.

     Many of the cases below were decided under corresponding provisions of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite> or prior to the 1991 amendments to this Chapter.

       "Agency".
   
   - The Department of Insurance is an "agency" subject to the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section. North Carolina Reinsurance Facility v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 390 S.E.2d 176 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Revenue is an administrative agency of the State. Bailey v. State, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 227</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 295 (1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 911, 112 S. Ct. 1942, 118 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1992), overruled on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 130</cite>, 500 S.E.2d 54 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (the Act) provides review only for agency decisions, G.S. 150B-50 (1991), and local units of government are not within the definition of agencies in subdivision (1), the principles embodied in the Act "are highly pertinent" to appellate review of local government actions. Vulcan Materials Co. v. Guilford County Bd. of County Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 444 S.E.2d 639, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 807</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 758 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an agency is not a unit of state government, but rather a local one, it does not fall under the definition of "agency" within the confines of the The Administrative Procedure Act, specifically, G.S. 150B-2(1a). Lee Ray Bergman Real Estate Rentals v. N.C. Fair Hous. Ctr., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 176, 568 S.E.2d 883 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Local school boards are not state agencies for purposes of the North Carolina Administrative Procedures Act and the statute relating to awards of attorneys' fees for parties prevailing against a state agency simply because they may be considered agents of the State in certain circumstances. Therefore, charter schools should not have been awarded attorneys' fees in a fund dispute with a local school board. Thomas Jefferson Classical Acad. Charter Sch. v. Cleveland County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 763 S.E.2d 288 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a dispute over funding for charter schools, attorneys' fees should not have been awarded under G.S. 150B-2 because a local school board was not a state agency. Local school boards were not state agencies for purposes of the Administrative Procedures Act simply because the local boards could have been considered agents for the State under certain circumstances. Thomas Jefferson Classical Acad. Charter Sch. v. Cleveland County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 763 S.E.2d 288 (2014).

       "Contested Case".
   
   - Case challenging a consent special order entered into by Environmental Management Commission and a corporation, which order was alleged to intrude upon the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process (which process requires a hearing), was "contested" for the purposes of former G.S. 150A-43. State ex rel. Tenn. Dep't of Health &amp; Env't v. Environmental Mgt. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 338 S.E.2d 781 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the rights of the petitioner were determined by an in-person interview and by an investigation conducted by a hearing officer of the North Carolina DMV, a state agency, they constituted "an agency proceeding." Therefore, the case was "contested" for purposes of G.S. 150B-43. Charlotte Truck Driver Training School, Inc. v. North Carolina DMV, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 381 S.E.2d 861 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioner's allegation that he had been "demoted in rank without sufficient cause" stated grounds for his department's action to be deemed "disciplinary" within the meaning and intent of G.S. 126-35 and for his case to be considered "contested" within the meaning and intent of G.S. 126-37(a) (now repealed). Because he had properly pursued all informal procedures mandated by the State Personnel Act [now the North Carolina Human Resources Act] and by the North Carolina Administrative Code for the resolution of his grievance, petitioner's appeal also fit the procedural profile of a "contested case" for purposes of its review by the Office of Administrative Hearings under this Chapter. Batten v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 338</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 35 (1990), overruled on other grounds, Empire Power Co. v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 569</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 168 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wildlife Resources Commission's rejection of sewer district's study and of its request for lower streamflow requirements constituted agency action giving rise to a dispute which ultimately became a "contested case" over which the Office of Administrative Hearings has jurisdiction. Metropolitan Sewerage Dist. v. North Carolina Wildlife Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 394 S.E.2d 668 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A contested case hearing is distinguishable from a contested case.
   
   The phrase "contested case" extends beyond an adjudicatory hearing to include any agency proceeding, by whatever name called, wherein the legal rights, duties and privileges of a party are required by law to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing. Community Psychiatric Ctrs. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 405 S.E.2d 769 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Elements of "Contested Case".
   
   - There are two elements of a "contested case": (1) An agency proceeding; (2) that determined the rights of a party or parties. Lloyd v. Babb, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Clear and Convincing Evidentiary Rule Invalid.

       "Person Aggrieved".
   
   - "Procedural injury," whereby petitioner State of Tennessee's right to be heard on certain aspects of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit was substantially impaired, was sufficient under former G.S. 150A-43 to qualify petitioner as an "aggrieved person" for purposes of appeal of issuance of Environmental Management Commission's consent special order with corporation. In addition, where the consent special order contained provisions substantially identical to provisions which petitioner opposed in the proposed NPDES permit, which affected the property rights of the petitioner in the Pigeon River, these allegations also established petitioner's "aggrieved person" status. State ex rel. Tenn. Dep't of Health &amp; Env't v. Environmental Mgt. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 338 S.E.2d 781 (1986).

       Where none of petitioner's personal rights or interests, nor any rights or interests properly attributable to him in a cognizable representative capacity, were either directly or indirectly at issue in requested rule making proceeding, he was not substantially affected by Department of Human Resources' denial of his petition for rule making. Therefore, he was not a "person aggrieved" as a result of the agency decision and had no standing to seek judicial review thereof. In re Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C.

       A pet owner was not a "person aggrieved" under G.S. 150B-2(6) as to the decision of the North Carolina Veterinary Medical Board disciplining a veterinarian against whom she filed a complaint, and therefore the pet owner was not entitled to an administrative hearing on the issue and had no standing to seek judicial review.

       Neighboring property owners to a proposed landfill site for which an application for a facility permit was pending would suffer interference with the use and enjoyment of and diminution in the value of their property if the permit were granted; thus, they were persons aggrieved under the statute who had standing to challenge a superior court's judgment on review of an administrative agency decision. Furthermore, a neighboring town was also a person aggrieved because its tax base and planning jurisdiction would be affected by the proposed landfill. County of Wake v. N.C.

       Decisions of North Carolina Council of State.
   
   - Superior court did not err in dismissing inmates' request for judicial review of the final decision of respondent North Carolina Council of State, which approved the lethal injection protocol the Department of Correction (DOC) submitted, because the process by which the Council approved or disapproved the DOC's lethal injection protocol was not subject to the APA, and the inmates could not challenge it by going through the Office of Administrative Hearings through the APA; instead, any issue the inmates had with the protocol rested with the General Court of Justice or the federal courts.

      </p>
      <p>
       General Assembly intended that the Department of Correction (DOC) have primary responsibility for the lethal injection process because G.S. 15-188 does not give the North Carolina Council of State authority beyond merely approving or disapproving the submitted protocol; the General Assembly did not intend to negate the express exemption that it provided to the DOC in the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by including a requirement that the Council approve the lethal injection protocol, and thus, the process by which the Council approves or disapproves the DOC's lethal injection protocol is not subject to the APA.

       The North Carolina Family and Children's Medicaid Manual was not a "rule" within the definition of G.S. 150B-2(8a), because it contained nonbinding interpretations of relevant state and federal law, and violations of its provisions were of no effect; thus, it did not have to be adopted pursuant to the requirements of the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act for the adoption of rules.

       There is statutory authority under G.S. 95-126(b)(2)(m) granted to the North Carolina Department of Labor to protect the health and safety of all employees in North Carolina; the operations manual is a non-binding interpretive statement, not a rule requiring formal rule-making procedures - accordingly, the exception that requires rule-making if the rights and duties of the employer are affected does not apply; thus, the operations manual merely established guidelines that directed Occupational Safety and Health Act inspectors as to what parties could be cited for violation of a rule and thus did not require formal rule-making.

       Intervenor Not Approved.
   
   - For purposes of meeting appeal requirements of G.S. 131E-188(b), appellant, proposed intervenor below, was not and could not be a party to contested hearing at issue below until its motion to intervene was approved. Since this motion was not approved, appellant was not a party to contested case, and therefore, did not meet jurisdictional requirements of G.S. 131E-188(b).

       "Substantial Evidence".
   
   - Administrative law judge and trial court did not err in finding contradictions in the testimony of a supervisor and an employee whom the supervisor promoted; based on the inconsistencies in testimony by the supervisor and the employee, relevant evidence existed that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion that their versions were contradictory.

       Substantial evidence supported the State Bureau of Investigation's (SBI's) decision that just cause justified terminating a special agent where the ALJ weighed the conflicting testimony, concluded that she had consumed alcohol and lied about it, considered character testimony, and sufficiently addressed the just cause factors.

       Substantial Evidence to Support Licensing Suspension.
   
   - Substantial evidence under G.S. 150B-2(8b) (now G.S. 150B-2(8c)) supported the Board of Dental Examiner's findings that (1) an orthodontist's treatment of a patient was untimely and that such untimeliness was a breach of the requisite standard of care for dentists under G.S. 90-41; and (2) the orthodontist's treatment of another patient was likewise negligent because the Board could reasonably have concluded that the standard of care required the use of photographs as a means to track the progress of orthodontic case.

       Substantial Evidence Supported Awarding Certificate of Need.
   
   - The findings by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services in awarding a certificate of need to an applicant, under the whole record test, were supported by substantial evidence, that is, relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might have accepted as adequate to support a conclusion, pursuant to G.S. 150B-2(8b) (now G.S. 150B-2(8c)).

       Scope of Appellate Review.
   
   - In an action arising from allegations of age discrimination, while the superior court properly applied both a de novo review and the whole-record test to the respective issues on appeal under G.S. 150B-51(b) when it reviewed the final decision of the State Personnel Commission (SPC) [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission], it erred when it improperly substituted its judgment for that of the SPC under the whole-record test. Thus, remand was ordered for the superior court to affirm the SPC's final agency decision. Trotter v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 659 S.E.2d 749 (2008).

        Procedures Substantially Affecting Nonagency Persons Must Be Adopted as Rules.

       - When G.S. 150B-2(8a) and G.S. 150B-11(1) are read together, it is apparent that any procedures, whether formal or informal, that directly or substantially affect the rights or procedures of nonagency persons must be adopted as rules. See opinion of Attorney General to Elizabeth H. Drury, Director, Office of Legislative and Legal Affairs, Department of Human Resources, 56 N.C.A.G. 25 (1986) decided prior to the 1991 amendment.

       - Determinations made by the securities administrator pursuant to his statutory authority are considered "contested cases" within the meaning of subdivision (2) of this section. Such determinations control or restrict the activities of dealers, salesmen, or issuers of securities, but these determinations only become "contested cases" if the administrator's action is "disputed" by the subject of such determination. See opinion of the Attorney General to Mr. Stephen M. Wallis, Deputy Securities Administrator (acting), 58 N.C.A.G. 76 (1988).

Before the commencement of such proceedings involving an occupational license, the agency shall give notice pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 150B-38.

   - Licensee's permit to operate underground storage tanks was not extended by virtue of G.S. 150B-3(a), extending a permit's expiration date until a final decision was made on whether an application for a new permit would be accepted, because he did not make a "timely and sufficient application for issuance or renewal" of his permit, so G.S. 150B-3(a) did not prevent the licensee from being fined for a lack of permits.

      <li id="t150Ba01s150B-4ol1a">
       On request of a person aggrieved, an agency shall issue a declaratory ruling as to the validity of a rule or as to the applicability to a given state of facts of a statute administered by the agency or of a rule or order of the agency. Upon request, an agency shall also issue a declaratory ruling to resolve a conflict or inconsistency within the agency regarding an interpretation of the law or a rule adopted by the agency. The agency shall prescribe in its rules the procedure for requesting a declaratory ruling and the circumstances in which rulings shall or shall not be issued. A declaratory ruling is binding on the agency and the person requesting it unless it is altered or set aside by the court. An agency may not retroactively change a declaratory ruling, but nothing in this section prevents an agency from prospectively changing a declaratory ruling.

       Editor's Note. -
   
<span class="s2">

     Most of the cases below were decided under corresponding provisions of former G.S. 150B-17 or <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Former G.S. 150A-17 clearly did not contemplate an evidentiary proceeding.
   
   If evidence were required to establish the facts, then the proper procedure would have been to hold a contested case hearing. In re Ford, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 569, 279 S.E.2d 122 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Good Cause for Denial.
   
   - Good cause exists for denial of a request for a declaratory ruling where the denial is based on the existence of a prior agency ruling which necessarily required an interpretation on the same statute which is the subject of the request for declaratory ruling. Catawba Mem. Hosp. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 557, 436 S.E.2d 390 (1993), cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 72</cite>, 445 S.E.2d 31 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina Department of State Treasurer could properly determine that good cause existed to deny a corporation's request for a declaratory ruling as to the potential future agreements because given the missing material terms of the contracts, any ruling on whether the contracts were in compliance with G.S. 116B-78 would be purely hypothetical; the corporation could not how that any of its legal rights were legally impaired. Equity Solutions of the Carolinas, Inc. v. N.C. Dep't of State Treasurer, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 384, 754 S.E.2d 243 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina Department of State Treasurer properly determined that good cause existed to decline to issue a declaratory ruling because it would be a waste of administrative resources for the State Treasurer to issue a ruling on a matter that would likely be judicially determined during the course of pending litigation between it and a corporation. Equity Solutions of the Carolinas, Inc. v. N.C. Dep't of State Treasurer, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 384, 754 S.E.2d 243 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court applied the proper standard of review when it affirmed the North Carolina Department of State Treasurer's decision to deny a corporation's request for a declaratory ruling and dismissing its petition for judicial review because the trial court properly applied a de novo standard of review to the issue of whether the reasons given by the State Treasurer constituted good cause to decline to issue a ruling. Equity Solutions of the Carolinas, Inc. v. N.C. Dep't of State Treasurer, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 384, 754 S.E.2d 243 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A declaratory ruling by an administrative agency is subject to judicial review
   
   as though it were an agency final decision or order in a contested case. High Rock Lake Ass'n v. North Carolina Envtl. Mgt. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 276 S.E.2d 472 (1981).

      <p>
       Party Not Aggrieved
   
   - Where the former caretaker sought a declaratory judgment pursuant to G.S. 150B-4 in the caretaker's action alleging that the caretaker could be harmed in the future by the department of health and human services' calculation of debt owed to the State for benefits taken under a certain program, the caretaker was not entitled to a declaratory judgment, because the caretaker was not aggrieved under G.S. 150B-2(6); the caretaker could be aggrieved in the future if certain events were to occur, but nothing in the record indicated that these events were certain to come to pass, imminently threatened, or likely to occur. Diggs v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 578 S.E.2d 666 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Declaratory Ruling Has No Effect When Petitioner Was Not Aggrieved.
   
   - Where the former caretaker argued that the former caretaker became aggrieved pursuant to G.S. 150B-2 when the department of health and human services issued a declaratory ruling pursuant to G.S. 150B-4, thereby entitling the former caretaker to a declaratory ruling pursuant to G.S. 150B-4, the argument failed, as the former caretaker was not a person aggrieved at the time the former caretaker requested a declaratory ruling, the declaratory ruling had no effect. Diggs v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 578 S.E.2d 666 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff Failing to Exhaust Administrative Remedies Not Entitled to Judicial Relief.
   
   - Plaintiff collection agency was not entitled to seek a declaratory judgment in the superior court as to the validity and applicability of a regulation of the Department of Insurance prohibiting collection agencies from instituting judicial proceedings on behalf of other persons, where plaintiff failed to exhaust available administrative remedies by petitioning the Department of Insurance for amendment or repeal of the regulation under former G.S. 150A-16 or seeking a declaratory ruling from the Department of Insurance as to the validity and applicability of the regulation under former G.S. 150A-17, and then by seeking judicial review of an adverse Department of Insurance decision under former G.S. 150A-43 et seq. Porter v. North Carolina Dep't of Ins., <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 253 S.E.2d 44, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 455</cite>, 256 S.E.2d 808 (1979).

   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   12101 et seq., was dismissed as the recipient failed to exhaust her administrative remedies; she could have sought a declaratory ruling under G.S. 150B-4 and the trial court did not obtain subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. Chatmon v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 85, 622 S.E.2d 684 (2005), overruled in part by Meza v. Div. of Soc. Servs. &amp; Div. of Med. Assistance of the N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 61</cite>, 692 S.E.2d 96 (2010).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial Court Lacked Jurisdiction Where Declaratory Relief Not Pursued in Agency Proceeding.
   
   - Original jurisdiction for a declaratory ruling as to the rights and interest of parties in a pier and boat ramp extending over a state-owned lake rested in the Department of Natural Resources and Community Development (now the Department of Environment and Natural Resources). As the parties did not pursue such declaratory relief and failed to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to instituting their civil action, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Woodlief v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 49, 330 S.E.2d 265 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal Held Moot.
   
   - Trial court properly concluded that a lobbyist's appeal of a decision of the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State was moot because although the Department applied aggravating factors under G.S. 120C-602(b) to enhance a civil fine, it did not enhance the fine in its final agency decision using those factors; therefore, a legal determination of whether the Department had authority to enhance the fine had no practical effect on the controversy. Beason v. N.C. Dep't of the Secy. of State, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 741 S.E.2d 663 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to conduct judicial review of a lobbyist's request for review because there was no longer any controversy once the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State decided to not apply aggravating factors to the lobbyist's fine; thus, the trial court properly concluded that the case was moot regardless of whether the lobbyist was a "person aggrieved" pursuant to G.S. 150B-4 and G.S. 150B-43. Beason v. N.C. Dep't of the Secy. of State, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 741 S.E.2d 663 (2013).

      This Article applies to an agency's exercise of its authority to adopt a rule. A rule is not valid unless it is adopted in substantial compliance with this Article. An agency shall not seek to implement or enforce against any person a policy, guideline, or other interpretive statement that meets the definition of a rule contained in G.S. 150B-2(8a) if the policy, guideline, or other interpretive statement has not been adopted as a rule in accordance with this Article.

       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 1991, ch. 418 repealed former Articles 2 and 5 and enacted in their place a new Article 2A. Where appropriate, the historical citations to sections in the repealed Articles have been added to corresponding sections in new Article 2A.

     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2013-360, s. 9.3(d), provides: "For the 2013-2014 fiscal year only and notwithstanding Article 2A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes, the State Board of Education shall be exempt from rulemaking in establishing a schedule of fees for teacher licensure and administrative changes pursuant to G.S. 115C-296(a2), as amended by this section."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2013-360, s. 13.6, provides: "Notwithstanding 02 NCAC 20B.0104, the Board of Agriculture may set admission fees for the 2013 State Fair without complying with the requirements of Article 2A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes. When this act becomes law, the Board shall post the 2013 admission fee schedule on its Web site and provide notice of the fee schedule, along with a citation to this section, to all persons named on the mailing list maintained pursuant to G.S. 150B-21.2(d)."
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2021-62, s. 3.5A(a)-(h), provides: "(a) When a county disengages from one area authority and realigns with another area authority under G.S. 122C-115, a portion of the risk reserve and other funds of the area authority from which the county is disengaging shall be transferred to the area authority with which the county is realigning. The amount of risk reserve and other funds to be transferred shall be determined by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in accordance with a formula or formulas developed in accordance with this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) Any formula developed by DHHS under this section shall consider the stability of both the area authority from which the county is disengaging and the area authority with which the county is realigning. The formula shall support the ability for each area authority to carry out its responsibilities under State law and shall support the successful operation of BH IDD tailored plans under G.S. 108D-60. The formula shall assure that the area authority from which the county is disengaging retains sufficient funds to pay any outstanding liabilities to health care providers, staff-related expenses, and other liabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(c) Upon the Secretary's approval of a disengagement under G.S. 122C-115(a3), the area authority from which the county is disengaging and the area authority with which the county is realigning shall provide DHHS with all financial information requested by DHHS that is necessary to determine the amount of funds to be transferred using the formula or formulas developed under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(d) Prior to finalizing any formula developed under this section, DHHS shall post the proposed formula on its website and provide notice of the proposed formula to all area authorities, the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Medicaid and NC Health Choice, and the Fiscal Research Division. DHHS shall accept public comment on the proposed formula. DHHS shall post the final version of the formula on its website no later than August 1, 2021.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(e) No later than October 15, 2021, DHHS shall report to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Medicaid and NC Health Choice, and the Fiscal Research Division on any formulas developed under this section and any funds transferred during the previous quarter. Beginning January 15, 2022, and quarterly thereafter through April 15, 2026, DHHS shall report to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Medicaid and NC Health Choice, and the Fiscal Research Division on any funds transferred as a result of disengagements during the previous quarter. A final quarterly report shall be due June 30, 2026, for the quarter ending on that date.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(f) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the development and application of the formula or formulas under this section shall be exempt from the rulemaking requirements under Article 2A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes and the contested case provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes.

      <p>
       Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard Required.
   
   - Substantial compliance under former G.S. 150A-9, among other things, required notice and the opportunity to be heard, as provided by former G.S. 150A-12, before the adoption of a rule. American Guar. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co. v. Ingram, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 233 S.E.2d 398, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 729</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 782 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Limitation on Authority of Social Services Commission to Make Rules.
   
   - The Social Services Commission has and continues to have general rule making authority under its grant in G.S. 143B-153 and by the provision of G.S. 108A-71 which authorizes the Department of Human Resources to accept all "State appropriations" for programs of social services. That grant became limited, however, by this Chapter upon its enactment, thereby requiring the Commission to comply with certain procedural requirements in adopting rules if specifically authorized by legislative enactment to adopt rules. Whittington v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 603, 398 S.E.2d 40 (1990).

       Rule denying Medicaid payments

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Compliance with This Chapter in Administering State Abortion Fund.
   
   - Since the State Abortion Fund prior to the enactment of Session Laws 1985, c. 479, s. 93 was merely a "state appropriation," the Department of Human Resources, through its Social Services Commission, could and did enact rules and regulations pertaining to the program. However, by the passage of s. 93, which specifically limits, by legislative enactment, how the Fund is to be administered, the Department of Human Resources and the Commission's rule making authority must comply with the requirements of this Chapter. Whittington v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 603, 398 S.E.2d 40 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction with Coastal Area Management Act.
   
   - The mandatory provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act must be read as complementing the procedural safeguards in the Coastal Area Management Act of 1974. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction with State Bar Rules.
   
   - North Carolina State Bar could not rely upon the felonious misconduct portion of N.C. St. Bar R. B.0111(e) to avoid dismissal of its claims for relief because that portion of the rule was not properly adopted under G.S. 84-21, the enabling statute governing the state bar's rulemaking authority; moreover, G.S. 84-21 did not contain a provision permitting only substantial compliance with its requirements, in contrast to G.S. 150B-18, and the more specific directions of G.S. 84-21 governed over the general rule-making provision of the North Carolina Administrative Procedures Act. N.C. State Bar v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 229, 644 S.E.2d 573 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative agency rules may be grouped into three categories:
   
   (1) Procedural rules which describe how the agency will discharge its assigned functions and the requirements others must follow in dealing with the agency; (2) Legislative rules which are established by an agency as a result of a delegation of legislative power to the agency; and (3) Interpretative rules which interpret and apply the provisions of the statute under which the agency operates. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 381</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 547, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 107</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 300 (1980), overruled on other grounds, In re Redmond, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 490</cite>, 797 S.E.2d 275, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 132 (2017).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court is not limited to the label placed on a rule by an agency,
   
   but must look instead to the substance of the rule in question. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 381</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 547, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 107</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 300 (1980), overruled on other grounds, In re Redmond, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 490</cite>, 797 S.E.2d 275, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 132 (2017).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Amendments to State Guidelines as Administrative Rule-Making.
   
   - Amendments to the State guidelines by the Coastal Resources Commission are considered administrative rule-making under this section and thus subject to the comprehensive additional safeguards contained in the Administrative Procedure Act. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Requirement by the Commissioner of Insurance that audited data be submitted in a ratemaking case was a legislative rule
   
   and therefore subject to the rule-making provisions of the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 381</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 547, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 107</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 300 (1980), overruled on other grounds, In re Redmond, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 490</cite>, 797 S.E.2d 275, 2017 N.C.

      <p>
       Construction of Former G.S. 150A-10(4).
   
   - The exclusion of policy statements or interpretations "made in the decision of a contested case" included in subdivision (4) of former G.S. 150A-10 clearly was not intended to embrace substantive rules with anticipated future applicability. This is so because of the difference between interpretative and legislative rules and because subdivision (6) of former G.S. 150A-10, which excludes "interpretative rules and general statements of policy of the agency" would be unnecessary if subdivision (4) of former G.S. 150A-10 were intended to apply to matters beyond the contested case in question. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 381</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 547, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 107</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 300 (1980), overruled on other grounds, In re Redmond, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 490</cite>, 797 S.E.2d 275, 2017 N.C.

      <p>
       Rule Not Properly Promulgated.
   
   - Provision in 2005 waiver was neither state nor federal law, and the state's erred in relying on the waiver to deny services to a Medicaid recipient as, although the provision interpreted Medicaid eligibility and was a rule under the North Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA), G.S. 150B-2(8a), it was not promulgated in accordance with either the APA or the federal Administrative Procedures Act as required by G.S. 150B-18, and the circumstances presented did not fit within the Arrowood v. North Carolina Dep't Health &amp; Human Servs., 543 S.E.2d 481 (2001), rev'g per curiam for reasons stated in the dissenting opinion, 535 S.E.2d 585 (2000), exception. McCrann v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 704 S.E.2d 899, review denied <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 198</cite>, 710 S.E.2d 23, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 436 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to conclude a dentist violated the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners' Record Content Rule (Rule) by not recording reasons for prescribing medication because: (1) the Rule's plain language had no such requirement, and (2) such a requirement would constitute a "rule" under G.S. 150B-2(8a) that had not been adopted pursuant to G.S. 150B-18 et seq. Walker v. N.C. State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 782 S.E.2d 518 (2016), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 517</cite>, 796 S.E.2d 784, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 131 (2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       General Assembly did not impliedly exempt the Board of Trustees from the necessity of compliance with APA's rulemaking provisions in adopting a cap factor where G.S. 135-5(a3) and G.S.
   <i>
    135-6(l)
   </i>
   could be harmonized, the adoption of a cap factor was not a ministerial act in which the Board did nothing more than ratify the actuary's recommendation, case law did not support such an implied exemption, and the public interests supported the Board of Education's contention that the cap factor should be established by using the APA's rulemaking provisions to ensure the opportunity for adequate public input before a decision became final. This case was decided prior to the enactment of G.S. 150B-1(d)(30) by Session Laws 2020-48, s. 4.1(c). Cabarrus Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Dep't of State Treasurer, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 3</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 814 (2020).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Formal Rule-Making Procedure Not Required.
   
   - There is statutory authority under G.S. 95-126(b)(2)(m) granted to the North Carolina Department of Labor to protect the health and safety of all employees in North Carolina; the operations manual is a non-binding interpretive statement, not a rule requiring formal rule-making procedures - accordingly, the exception that requires rule-making if the rights and duties of the employer are affected does not apply; thus, the operations manual merely established guidelines that directed Occupational Safety and Health Act inspectors as to what parties could be cited for violation of a rule and thus did not require formal rule-making.

   - Because neither G.S. 160A-325(a) nor any other statute specifically authorized the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to implement or interpret G.S. 160A-325(a), it was not part of the Department's regulatory permitting scheme for solid waste management landfills; assuming, arguendo, that a town was required to adhere to its requirements, the failure to do so did not require withdrawal of a facility permit for a proposed landfill.

         An agency shall consider the cumulative effect of all rules adopted by the agency related to the specific purpose for which the rule is proposed. The agency shall not adopt a rule that is unnecessary or redundant.
        </li>
        <li id="t150Ba2As150B-19.1ol1a5">
         When appropriate, rules shall be based on sound, reasonably available scientific, technical, economic, and other relevant information. Agencies shall include a reference to this information in the notice of text required by G.S. 150B-21.2(c).
        </li>

       Each agency shall determine whether its policies and programs overlap with the policies and programs of another agency.

      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-19.1ol1e">
       Each agency shall quantify the costs and benefits to all parties of a proposed rule to the greatest extent possible.

       Action. - If an agency denies a rule-making petition, it must send the person who submitted the petition a written statement of the reasons for denying the petition. If an agency grants a rule-making petition, it must inform the person who submitted the rule-making petition of its decision and must initiate rule-making proceedings. When an agency grants a rule-making petition, the notice of text it publishes in the North Carolina Register may state that the agency is initiating rule making as the result of a rule-making petition and state the name of the person who submitted the rule-making petition. If the rule-making petition requested the creation or amendment of a rule, the notice of text the agency publishes may set out the text of the requested rule change submitted with the rule-making petition and state whether the agency endorses the proposed text.

        Adoption of Rules.
       </b>
       - The Water Quality Committee of the Environmental Management Commission could immediately adopt temporary rules under G.S. 150B-21(a)(5) to establish a permit program for regulating impacts to isolated wetlands and surface waters because a recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court invalidating the Army Corps of Engineers' exercise of jurisdiction over such isolated waters was a court order under N.C.G.S. G.S. 150B-21.1(a)(5). See opinion of Attorney General to Dr. Charles H. Peterson, Vice Chairman, Environmental Management Commission, and Ms. Coleen Sullins, Water Quality Section, Division of Water Quality, 2001 N.C. AG LEXIS 33 (9/5/01).

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.1Aol1a">
       Adoption. - An agency may adopt an emergency rule without prior notice or hearing or upon any abbreviated notice or hearing the agency finds practical when it finds that adherence to the notice and hearing requirements of this Part would be contrary to the public interest and that the immediate adoption of the rule is required by a serious and unforeseen threat to the public health or safety. When an agency adopts an emergency rule, it must simultaneously commence the process for adopting a temporary rule by submitting the rule to the Codifier of Rules for publication on the Internet in accordance with G.S. 150B-21.1(a3). The Department of Health and Human Services or the appropriate rule-making agency within the Department may adopt emergency rules in accordance with this section when a recent act of the General Assembly or the United States Congress or a recent change in federal regulations authorizes new or increased services or benefits for children and families and the emergency rule is necessary to implement the change in State or federal law.
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.1Aol1b">
       Review. - An agency must prepare a written statement of its findings of need for an emergency rule. The statement must be signed by the head of the agency adopting the rule. When an agency adopts an emergency rule, it must submit the rule and the agency's written statement of its findings of the need for the rule to the Codifier of Rules. Within two business days after an agency submits an emergency rule, the Codifier of Rules must review the agency's written statement of findings of need for the rule to determine whether the statement of need meets the criteria in subsection (a) of this section. In reviewing the statement, the Codifier of Rules may consider any information submitted by the agency or another person. If the Codifier of Rules finds that the statement meets the criteria, the Codifier of Rules must notify the head of the agency and enter the rule in the North Carolina Administrative Code on the sixth business day following approval by the Codifier of Rules.
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.1Aol1c">
       Standing. - A person aggrieved by an emergency rule adopted by an agency may file an action for declaratory judgment in Wake County Superior Court pursuant to Article 26 of Chapter 1 of the General Statutes. In the action, the court shall determine whether the agency's written statement of findings of need for the rule meets the criteria listed in subsection (a) of this section and whether the rule meets the standards in G.S. 150B-21.9. The court shall not grant an ex parte temporary restraining order.
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.1Aol1d">
       Effective Date and Expiration. - An emergency rule becomes effective on the date specified in G.S. 150B-21.3. An emergency rule expires on the earliest of the following dates:
       <ol>
        <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.1Aol1d1">
         The date specified in the rule.
        </li>
        <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.1Aol1d2">
         The effective date of the temporary rule adopted to replace the emergency rule, if the Commission approves the temporary rule.
        </li>
        <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.1Aol1d3">
         The date the Commission returns to an agency a temporary rule the agency adopted to replace the emergency rule.
        </li>
        <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.1Aol1d4">
         Sixty days from the date the emergency rule was published in the North Carolina Register, unless the temporary rule adopted to replace the emergency rule has been submitted to the Commission.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.1Aol1e">
       Publication. - When the Codifier of Rules enters an emergency rule in the North Carolina Administrative Code, the Codifier of Rules must publish the rule in the North Carolina Register.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If the Codifier of Rules finds that the statement does not meet the criteria in subsection (a) of this section, the Codifier of Rules must immediately notify the head of the agency. The agency may supplement its statement of need with additional findings or submit a new statement. If the agency provides additional findings or submits a new statement, the Codifier of Rules must review the additional findings or new statement within one business day after the agency submits the additional findings or new statement. If the Codifier of Rules again finds that the statement does not meet the criteria in subsection (a) of this section, the Codifier of Rules must immediately notify the head of the agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an agency decides not to provide additional findings or submit a new statement when notified by the Codifier of Rules that the agency's findings of need for a rule do not meet the required criteria, the agency must notify the Codifier of Rules of its decision. The Codifier of Rules must then enter the rule in the North Carolina Administrative Code on the sixth business day after receiving notice of the agency's decision. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, if the agency has not complied with the provisions of G.S. 12-3.1, the Codifier of Rules shall not enter the rule into the Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      Filing a petition for rule making or a request for a declaratory ruling with the agency that adopted the rule is not a prerequisite to filing an action under this subsection. A person who files an action for declaratory judgment under this subsection must serve a copy of the complaint on the agency that adopted the rule being contested, the Codifier of Rules, and the Commission.

      - Former G.S. 150B-21.1B, which established an expedited procedure for adoption of rules to implement the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, expired June 30, 2012, pursuant to Session Laws 2009-475, s. 16.

     <p>
      Session Laws 2009-475, s. 15, provides: "The General Assembly finds that it is in the public interest of the State of North Carolina to ensure expeditious awards of ARRA funds to maximize the economic recovery impact of the ARRA. It is the policy of the State to provide fair regulation, oversight, and transparency for the use of ARRA funds and to quickly and efficiently complete the awards of grants and contracts under the ARRA. It is also the policy of this State that, due to the historic level of federal and State oversight of ARRA grant and contract awards, restraint should be exercised in the granting of legal and injunctive relief that might forestall awards to programs and contractors."

       § 150B-21.3. Effective date of rules.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.3ol1a">
       Temporary and Emergency Rules. - A temporary rule or an emergency rule becomes effective on the date the Codifier of Rules enters the rule in the North Carolina Administrative Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.3ol1b">
       Permanent Rule. - A permanent rule approved by the Commission becomes effective on the first day of the month following the month the rule is approved by the Commission, unless the Commission received written objections to the rule in accordance with subsection (b2) of this section, or unless the agency that adopted the rule specifies a later effective date.
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.3ol1-b1">
       Delayed Effective Dates. - Except as provided in G.S. 14-4.1, if the Commission received written objections to the rule in accordance with subsection (b2) of this section, the rule becomes effective on the earlier of the thirty-first legislative day or the day of adjournment of the next regular session of the General Assembly that begins at least 25 days after the date the Commission approved the rule, unless a different effective date applies under this section. If a bill that specifically disapproves the rule is introduced in either house of the General Assembly before the thirty-first legislative day of that session, the rule becomes effective on the earlier of either the day an unfavorable final action is taken on the bill or the day that session of the General Assembly adjourns without ratifying a bill that specifically disapproves the rule. If the agency adopting the rule specifies a later effective date than the date that would otherwise apply under this subsection, the later date applies. A permanent rule that is not approved by the Commission or that is specifically disapproved by a bill enacted into law before it becomes effective does not become effective.
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.3ol1-b2">
       Objection. - Any person who objects to the adoption of a permanent rule may submit written comments to the agency. If the objection is not resolved prior to adoption of the rule, a person may submit written objections to the Commission. If the Commission receives written objections from 10 or more persons, no later than 5:00 P.M. of the day following the day the Commission approves the rule, clearly requesting review by the legislature in accordance with instructions posted on the agency's Web site pursuant to G.S. 150B-19.1(c)(4), and the Commission approves the rule, the rule will become effective as provided in subsection (b1) of this section. The Commission shall notify the agency that the rule is subject to legislative disapproval on the day following the day it receives 10 or more written objections. When the requirements of this subsection have been met and a rule is subject to legislative disapproval, the agency may adopt the rule as a temporary rule if the rule would have met the criteria listed in G.S. 150B-21.1(a) at the time the notice of text for the permanent rule was published in the North Carolina Register. If the Commission receives objections from 10 or more persons clearly requesting review by the legislature, and the rule objected to is one of a group of related rules adopted by the agency at the same time, the agency that adopted the rule may cause any of the other rules in the group to become effective as provided in subsection (b1) of this section by submitting a written statement to that effect to the Commission before the other rules become effective.
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.3ol1c">
       Executive Order Exception. - The Governor may, by executive order, make effective a permanent rule that has been approved by the Commission but the effective date of which has been delayed in accordance with subsection (b1) of this section upon finding that it is necessary that the rule become effective in order to protect public health, safety, or welfare. A rule made effective by executive order becomes effective on the date the order is issued or at a later date specified in the order. When the Codifier of Rules enters in the North Carolina Administrative Code a rule made effective by executive order, the entry must reflect this action.
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.3ol1-c1">
       Fees. - Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a rule that establishes a new fee or increases an existing fee shall not become effective until the agency has complied with the requirements of G.S. 12-3.1.

      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.3ol1d">

       OSHA Standard. - A permanent rule concerning an occupational safety and health standard that is adopted by the Occupational Safety and Health Division of the Department of Labor and is identical to a federal regulation promulgated by the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor becomes effective on the date the Division delivers the rule to the Codifier of Rules, unless the Division specifies a later effective date. If the Division specifies a later effective date, the rule becomes effective on that date.
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.3ol1f">
       Technical Change. - A permanent rule for which no notice or hearing is required under G.S. 150B-21.5(a)(1) through (a)(5) or G.S. 150B-21.5(b) becomes effective on the first day of the month following the month the rule is approved by the Rules Review Commission.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A bill specifically disapproves a rule if it contains a provision that refers to the rule by appropriate North Carolina Administrative Code citation and states that the rule is disapproved. Notwithstanding any rule of either house of the General Assembly, any member of the General Assembly may introduce a bill during the first 30 legislative days of any regular session to disapprove a rule that has been approved by the Commission and that either has not become effective or has become effective by executive order under subsection (c) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      A rule that is made effective by executive order remains in effect unless it is specifically disapproved by the General Assembly in a bill enacted into law on or before the day of adjournment of the regular session of the General Assembly that begins at least 25 days after the date the executive order is issued. A rule that is made effective by executive order and that is specifically disapproved by a bill enacted into law is repealed as of the date specified in the bill. If a rule that is made effective by executive order is not specifically disapproved by a bill enacted into law within the time set by this subsection, the Codifier of Rules must note this in the North Carolina Administrative Code.

The agency shall consider any recommendations offered by the Board of Transportation prior to adopting the rule. Once a rule subject to this subsection is adopted, the Board of Transportation may submit any objection to the rule it may have to the Rules Review Commission. If the Rules Review Commission receives an objection to a rule from the Board of Transportation no later than 5:00 P.M. of the day following the day the Commission approves the rule, then the rule shall only become effective as provided in G.S. 150B-21.3(b1).

       Rulemaking Authority of State Board of Education Subject to Review and Approval by Commission.
   
   - Trial court erred in granting the North Carolina State Board of Education summary judgment in its action to prevent the North Carolina Rules Review Commission from exercising any authority over it and controlling its enactment of rules because the Board's rulemaking authority was subject to statutes providing for review and approval by the Commission; this holding fell within the 1942 North Carolina Constitutional amendment's delineation of the General Assembly's authority over the Board.

       Judicial Review.

       Commission's Authority.
   
   - General assembly has given the North Carolina Rules Review Commission the authority to determine whether a proposed rule is within the authority delegated to the agency by the legislature; where, only after the pharmacy board received an unfavorable outcome regarding its proposed pharmacist hours rule did it allege the process was unconstitutional, the board was estopped from raising a constitutional challenge to the commission's authority, and the trial court did not err by refusing to rule on that challenge.

       Action. - When the Commission objects to a permanent rule, it must send the agency that adopted the rule a written statement of the objection and the reason for the objection. The agency that adopted the rule must take one of the following actions:
       <ol>
        <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.12ol1a1">
         Change the rule to satisfy the Commission's objection and submit the revised rule to the Commission.

       Time Limit. - An agency that is not a board or commission must take one of the actions listed in subsection (a) of this section within 30 days after receiving the Commission's statement of objection. A board or commission must take one of these actions within 30 days after receiving the Commission's statement of objection or within 10 days after the board or commission's next regularly scheduled meeting, whichever comes later.
      </li>
      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.12ol1c">
       Changes. - When an agency changes a rule in response to an objection by the Commission, the Commission must determine whether the change satisfies the Commission's objection. If it does, the Commission must approve the rule. If it does not, the Commission must send the agency a written statement of the Commission's continued objection and the reason for the continued objection. The Commission must also determine whether the change is substantial. In making this determination, the Commission shall use the standards set forth in G.S. 150B-21.2(g). If the change is substantial, the revised rule shall be published and reviewed in accordance with the procedure set forth in G.S. 150B-21.1(a3) and (b).

      <li id="t150Ba2As150B-21.12ol1d">
       Return of Rule. - A rule to which the Commission has objected remains under review by the Commission until the agency that adopted the rule decides not to satisfy the Commission's objection and makes a written request to the Commission to return the rule to the agency. When the Commission returns a rule to which it has objected, it must notify the Codifier of Rules of its action. If the rule that is returned would have increased or decreased expenditures or revenues of a unit of local government, the Commission must also notify the Governor of its action and must send a copy of the record of the Commission's review of the rule to the Governor. The record of review consists of the rule, the Commission's letter of objection to the rule, the agency's written response to the Commission's letter, and any other relevant documents before the Commission when it decided to object to the rule.

   - Notwithstanding any other provision of Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes, the chief administrative law judge may limit and simplify the procedures that apply to a contested Medicaid case involving a Medicaid applicant or recipient in order to complete the case as quickly as possible. To the extent possible, the Office of Administrative Hearings shall schedule and hear all contested Medicaid cases within 55 days of submission of a request for appeal. Hearings shall be conducted telephonically or by video technology, however the recipient or applicant, or the recipient's or applicant's representative may request that the hearing be conducted before the administrative law judge in-person. An in-person hearing shall be conducted in Wake County, however for good cause shown, the in-person hearing may be conducted in the county of residence of the recipient or applicant. Good cause shall include but is not limited to the applicant's or recipient's impairments limiting travel or the unavailability of the applicant's or recipient's treating professional witnesses. The Department shall provide written notice to the recipient or applicant of the use of telephonic hearings, hearings by video conference, and in-person hearings before the administrative law judge, and how to request a hearing in the recipient's or applicant's county of residence. The simplified procedure may include requiring that all prehearing motions be considered and ruled on by the administrative law judge in the course of the hearing of the case on the merits. An administrative law judge assigned to a contested Medicaid case shall make reasonable efforts in a case involving a Medicaid applicant or recipient who is not represented by an attorney to assure a fair hearing and to maintain a complete record of the hearing. The administrative law judge may allow brief extensions of the time limits contained in this section for good cause and to ensure that the record is complete. Good cause includes delays resulting from untimely receipt of documentation needed to render a decision and other unavoidable and unforeseen circumstances. Continuances shall only be granted in accordance with rules adopted by the Office of Administrative Hearings, and shall not be granted on the day of the hearing, except for good cause shown. If a petitioner fails to make an appearance at a hearing that has been properly noticed via certified mail by the Office of Administrative Hearings, the Office of Administrative Hearings shall immediately dismiss the contested case provision.

These funds shall be allocated by OAH for mediation services provided for Medicaid
   recipient appeals and to contract for other services necessary to conduct the appeals process. OAH shall continue the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Department for mediation services provided for Medicaid recipient appeals and contracted services necessary to conduct the appeals process.

All such informal appeals by Medicaid applicants or recipients under the current system which are pending on that date and for which a hearing has not been held shall be discontinued and the applicant or recipient offered an opportunity to appeal to the Office of Administrative Hearings in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10.15A(h1) of this act. The Department shall make every effort to resolve or settle all of the backlogged cases prior to the effective date of this act.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      "(h6) The appeals process for Medicaid applicants and recipients established under this section shall expire July 1, 2010.

       Timely Petition.
   
   - Failure to timely petition for a hearing before the Office of Administrative Hearings constituted waiver of any right to that administrative remedy. Citizens for Responsible Roadways v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 550 S.E.2d 253 (2001).

      <p>
       Petitioner's allegation that he had been "demoted in rank without sufficient cause"
   
   stated grounds for his department's action to be deemed "disciplinary" within the meaning and intent of G.S. 126-35 and for his case to be considered "contested" within the meaning and intent of G.S. 126-37(a)
   (now repealed). Because he had properly pursued all informal procedures mandated by the State Personnel Act [now the North Carolina Human Resources Act] and by the North Carolina Administrative Code for the resolution of his grievance, petitioner's appeal also fit the procedural profile of a "contested case" for purposes of its review by the Office of Administrative Hearings under this chapter. Batten v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 338</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 35 (1990), overruled on other grounds, Empire Power Co. v.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Dispute as "Contested Case"
   
   - Wildlife Resources Commission's rejection of sewer district's study and of its request for lower streamflow requirements constituted agency action giving rise to a dispute which ultimately became a "contested case" over which the Office of Administrative Hearings has jurisdiction. Metropolitan Sewerage Dist. v. North Carolina Wildlife Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 394 S.E.2d 668 (1990).

       Where a trade association, adversely affected by certain licensing procedures, was a "person aggrieved" under G.S. 150B-2(6), and where licensing issues were deemed to be "contested cases" under G.S. 150B-2(2), (3) and G.S. 150B-22, the association had standing to bring a contested case challenging the state agencies' general permitting procedures for wood chip mills.

      <p>
       Exception to Exhaustion of Remedies Requirement.
   
   - Insured's breach of contract claim was properly dismissed since she did not exhaust her administrative remedies or allege the inadequacy of her administrative remedies in the complaint; she did not fall within the exception to the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act's (APA) exhaustion requirement for when the remedy established by the APA was inadequate.

       Authority To Enter Into Settlement Agreements.

       Authority To Settle.
   
   - Where the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and the applicant engaged in litigation to determine whether the applicant's assisted living center projects were exempt from a moratorium on such projects, the Department and the North Carolina Attorney General properly exercised their statutory authority under G.S. 150B-22 to settle the litigation.

       Filing of Petition for "Contested Case" Hearing.
   
   - The language of G.S. 131E-188(a) leaves no room for judicial construction.
   The statute clearly contemplates that a petition for a contested case hearing must be filed - not mailed or served - with the Office of Administrative Hearings within the 30-day deadline. Gummels v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 675, 392 S.E.2d 113 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the 1986 version of G.S. 131E-188(a) in effect at time of petitioner's request for a contested case hearing, request was timely "filed" with the Division of Facility Services [now the Division of Health Service Regulation] where it was received within 30 days of the contested decision; the version of the subdivision in effect at that time read in pertinent part:
   "... any affected person shall be entitled to a contested case hearing under Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite> [now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite>] of the General Statutes, if the department receives a request therefor within 30 days after its decision." Under the current statutes, a request must be filed within 30 days, not just received. Huntington Manor v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 393 S.E.2d 104 (1990).

Code 3.0120(e) stated that a party did not need to be represented by an attorney at administrative hearings; the term "representative" as used in G.S. 150B-23, was not coterminous with the term "attorney."

       Burden of Proof.
   
   - While neither G.S. 150B-23(a) nor G.S. 150B-29(a) specifically allocated the burden of proof in an administrative appeal, it had been held that that an administrative law judge was to determine whether a petitioner had met its burden in showing that the agency acted or failed to act as provided in G.S. 150B-23(a)(1) - (5), and it had been observed that caselaw held that unless a statute provided otherwise, a petitioner had the burden of proof in Office of Administrative Hearings contested cases.

       - It was within the ALJ's discretion to dismiss the petition as untimely under the North Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA), because although the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) instructs states to make a free appropriate public education (FAPE) available, it has left to the states the procedural mechanisms for putting the same in place, and application of the APA's 60-day limitation was not inconsistent with the underlying policies of the IDEA.

      </p>
      <p>
       The court held that the 60-day limitations period in this section is the period associated with former G.S. 115C-116 (repealed) and rejected the idea that North Carolina's catch-all three-year statute of limitations for statutory actions for which no limitations period is otherwise provided, pursuant to G.S. 1-52(2), constituted a better borrowing choice and one more consistent with federal policies.

       The Administrative Procedure Act does not apply to a case involving the Outdoor Advertising Control Act,

       Thirty-day time limit specified in G.S. 126-38 (now repealed) only applied to the filing of the petition and not to the payment of the required fee as former G.S. 126-38 indicated that the applicable temporal requirement was satisfied if the petition for a contested case hearing was filed within 30 days of the date upon which the employee received notice of the decision or action which triggered the right of appeal; although G.S. 150B-23(a) treats both the filing of the petition and the payment of the required fee as necessary to permit the commencement of a contested case and although G.S. 150B-23.2(B) requires the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) to collect any required fees at the time of the commencement of the contested case, nothing in the relevant statutory language requires the payment of the required fee simultaneously with the filing of the petition as a precondition for the invocation of the OAH's jurisdiction.

   - In appropriate circumstances, the 60-day time limitation of subsection (f) may be tolled. Specifically, such tolling is appropriate where a court's erroneous assertion of jurisdiction brings a dispute over an administrative agency's ruling into the court which would normally review decisions of that agency, and - in reliance on this assertion of jurisdiction - a party fails to seek administrative review within the statutory time limit.

       The time limitation of subsection (f) of this section was tolled by the superior court's erroneous assertion of subject matter jurisdiction over respondents' penalty assessment and remained tolled until the court's assertion of jurisdiction was vacated by the Court of Appeals' mandate. The Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) had subject matter jurisdiction over petitioners' contested case petition, since this petition was timely filed in the OAH following the issuance of the Court of Appeals' mandate.

       While the intervenors had a general interest in an underlying issue, whether the property owner was exempt from the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973, they did not have a direct interest in the civil penalty imposed by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, which was the property or transaction at issue pursuant to G.S. 113A-64(a)(5); accordingly, the ALJ erred by granting intervention as of right.

       Because the time and expense involved in a second, unanticipated round of discovery in an environmental civil penalty matter was prejudicial to the property owner, as was the requirement that the property owner meet its burden of proof against both intervenors and the state agency authorized to impose the civil penalty, the ALJ abused his discretion in allowing permissive intervention.

   - Although a trial court properly reviewed, under G.S. 150B-51(b)(5), a final agency decision of a contested case petition filed pursuant to G.S. 150B-23, the trial court incorrectly applied the standard of review by making its own findings of fact on unappealed issues. Town of Wallace v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., Div. of Water Quality, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 49, 584 S.E.2d 809 (2003).

      <p>
       Pursuant to G.S. 150B-23(f), the time for a Medicaid provider's appeal of a negative decision by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) begins to run when DHHS notifies the health care provider of DHHS's "final decision" and of the provider's right to appeal from the agency's final decision to the Office of Administrative Hearings. N.C. HHS v. Parker Home Care, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 551, 784 S.E.2d 552 (2016), review denied, mot. dismissed, stay denied, 793 S.E.2d 690, 2016 N.C.

      <p>
       ALJ and trial court had jurisdiction to hear a Medicaid provider's contest to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS) decision that the provider received an overpayment, despite the provider's failure to appeal that decision within 60 days of receiving a private contractor's tentative notice of overpayment (TNO), because the TNO did not begin the time for appealing an administrative decision, as DHHS could not delegate the discretionary authority to decide how to dispose of the issue to the private contractor as (1) DHHS was the state's single state agency authorized to make such decisions, and (2) the TNO stated a "final decision" would be reached in the future, so the TNO did not inform the provider of DHHS's final decision on the matter, which initiated the appeal time.

        Substantial Prejudice Sufficiently Alleged.
       </b>
       - Organizations sufficiently alleged substantial prejudice for purposes of G.S. 150B-23 as members had homes and businesses along the creek in which wastewater was to be discharged, and the organizations alleged that the state agency failed to follow its own regulations in issuing the permit, thereby causing damage to the creek's water quality, biota, and the benefits derived from the creek.

       Substantial Prejudice Shown.
   
   - Issuance of a "No Review" letter by the North Carolina DHHS was properly contested because a branch office proposed by a hospice was not located within the service area of the hospice; therefore, the proposed branch office was a new institutional health service for which the hospice had to obtain a certificate of need.

       Substantial Prejudice Not Shown.
   
   - In a hospital's contested case petition under G.S. 131E-188(a) to challenge the conditional approval of a certificate of need (CON) permitting a medical center to expand its emergency room facilities, the medical center was entitled to summary judgment because the hospital did not prove substantial prejudice from the CON under G.S. 150B-23(a); the hospital's claim of prejudice from challenges by the medical center to a facility it was building had been declared moot in another action, and judicial estoppel did not bar the medical center from claiming that the hospital was not substantially prejudiced because the other action was not related and did not stem from a common set of circumstances.

       Superior court did not err in affirming the decision of the Office of Administrative Hearings to grant summary judgment for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in corporations' action challenging the validity of a settlement DHHS entered into with an assisted living limited liability company (LLC), which gave the LLC a contractual right to develop adult care home beds, because the corporation did not demonstrate that they were substantially prejudiced as a matter of law; even if DHHS had not entered the settlement, it could not have required the LLC to submit a certificate of need application in order to give the corporations the opportunity to comment on the LLC's plans since the Certificate of Need Law, G.S. 131E-175 et seq. was held to be inapplicable to the LLC's projects.

       N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section, properly concluded that the health care provider failed to prove that it suffered substantial prejudice from the granting of a certificate of need to a medical center for the development of two gastrointestinal endoscopy rooms because the provider's only alleged harm was only that competition would be increased. CaroMont Health, Inc. v. N.C. HHS Div. of Health Serv. Regulation, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 751 S.E.2d 244 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       When providers contested an agency's decision to let a competitor move specialty operating rooms to the providers' area, the agency's alleged failure to follow the agency's rules did not establish the providers' substantial prejudice as a matter of law because the providers also had to show the agency deprived the providers of property, ordered the providers to pay a fine or penalty, or otherwise substantially prejudiced the providers' rights. Surgical Care Affiliates, LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. App.</cite> 620, 762 S.E.2d 468 (2014).

      <p>
       Competitor showed no error in the administrative law judge granting summary judgment for a certificate of need applicant's application because the competitor did not meet the competitor's burden to show substantial prejudice from granting the application, as (1) the proposed project added no new beds, services, or equipment, and (2) any harm from normal competition was not substantial prejudice.

        Procedural, Not Substantive Provisions of Act Applicable to Appeals of County Agency Decisions.
       </b>
       - Given the detailed substantive provisions of G.S. 108A-79, designed specifically to apply to appeals of county agency decisions, and the fact that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), by its terms, does not apply to such appeals, the Legislature, by reference to the APA, did not intend to substitute the Act's substantive requirements for those of G.S. 108A-79. The citation to the APA simply indicates a legislative intent to incorporate the powers of hearing officers and the hearing procedures detailed in the Act into G.S. 108A-79(i) by reference.

       Filing Fee Did Not Have to Be Paid Simultaneously With Filing of Petition.
   
   - North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings and North Carolina State Personnel Board had jurisdiction over plaintiff's challenge to his dismissal as a State trooper, even though he did not pay the contested case filing fee simultaneously with his petition, as G.S. 150B-23(a) and G.S. 150B-23.2(b) did not require payment of the filing fee simultaneously with the petition as a prerequisite for jurisdiction, and under 26 N.C. Admin. Code 03.0103, a litigant was afforded a reasonable time to pay the fee. Scott v. N.C. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 730 S.E.2d 806 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirty-day time limit specified in G.S. 126-38 (now repealed) only applied to the filing of the petition and not to the payment of the required fee as former G.S. 126-38 indicated that the applicable temporal requirement was satisfied if the petition for a contested case hearing was filed within 30 days of the date upon which the employee received notice of the decision or action which triggered the right of appeal; although G.S. 150B-23(a) treats both the filing of the petition and the payment of the required fee as necessary to permit the commencement of a contested case and although G.S. 150B-23.2(B) requires the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) to collect any required fees at the time of the commencement of the contested case, nothing in the relevant statutory language requires the payment of the required fee simultaneously with the filing of the petition as a precondition for the invocation of the OAH's jurisdiction.

<span class="s2">

     Some of the cases below were decided under corresponding provisions of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>, or under this Chapter prior to the 1991 amendments thereto.
     <br />

      <p>
       The standard of review, known as the "whole record test,"
   
   presents to the trial judge a task which must be distinguished from both de novo review and the any competent evidence standard of review. Goodwin v. Goldsboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 312 S.E.2d 892, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 304</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 680 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole record test is not a tool of judicial intrusion; instead it merely gives a reviewing court the capability to determine whether an administrative decision has a rational basis in the evidence. Thus, the task before the trial court is to consider all the evidence, both that which supports the decision of the board and that which detracts from it. Goodwin v. Goldsboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 312 S.E.2d 892, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 304</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 680 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole record test does not allow the reviewing court to replace the board's judgment as between two reasonably conflicting views, even though the court could justifiably have reached a different result had the matter been before it de novo. On the other hand, the whole record rule requires the court, in determining the substantiality of evidence supporting the board's decision, to take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from the weight of the board's evidence. Goodwin v. Goldsboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 312 S.E.2d 892, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 304</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 680 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the whole evidence rule, the court may not consider the evidence which in and of itself justifies the board's result, without taking into account contradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn. Goodwin v. Goldsboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 312 S.E.2d 892, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 304</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 680 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Standard of Proof.
   
   - The standard of proof in administrative matters is by the greater weight of the evidence, and it is error to require a showing by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. Dillingham v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 704, 513 S.E.2d 823 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden of Proof.
   
   - While neither G.S. 150B-23(a) nor G.S. 150B-29(a) specifically allocated the burden of proof in an administrative appeal, it had been held that that an administrative law judge was to determine whether a petitioner had met its burden in showing that the agency acted or failed to act as provided in G.S. 150B-23(a)(1) - (5), and it had been observed that caselaw held that unless a statute provided otherwise, a petitioner had the burden of proof in Office of Administrative Hearings contested cases. Overcash v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 635 S.E.2d 442 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 220</cite>, 642 S.E.2d 445 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in its allocation of the burden of proof on a chicken processing facility operator because he burden of proof rests on the petitioner challenging the decision of the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. House of Raeford Farms, Inc. v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 774 S.E.2d 911 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Adjustment Not Required to Sound-Record Hearings.
   
   - Municipal corporations were specifically excluded from requirements under former G.S. 150A-29 and former G.S. 150A-37 that trial rules of evidence and production of evidence be followed in proceedings before State agencies. Thus, a Board of Adjustment was not required to sound-record its hearings. Washington Park Neighborhood Ass'n v. Winston-Salem Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 241 S.E.2d 872, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 91</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 263 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       As to admissibility of evidence in proceeding before Property Tax Commission,
   
   see In re McLean Trucking Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 375</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 194, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 156</cite> (1972), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 909, 34 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports of physicians are acceptable as evidence,
   
   since an agency may use its experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge in the evaluation of evidence presented to it. Lackey v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 231</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 171 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden of Proof on Unemployment Claimant.
   
   - Where a claimant for unemployment previously quit her job to retire and was presently claiming to have reentered the labor market, the degree of proof required of the claimant was by the greater weight of the evidence. In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       School Board's Dismissal of At-Will Employee Upheld.
   
   - It was not arbitrary or capricious, nor an abuse of discretion, for school board to terminate an at-will employee for making a racial comment in a school setting. Cooper v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 200, 519 S.E.2d 536 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Properly Admitted.
   
   - When a terminated state law enforcement agent alleged discrimination on the basis of political affiliation, the testimony by a former deputy secretary of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety (DPS) that a state senator told the deputy secretary that the agent's reassignment shouldn't have occurred and that they were going to fix it and that the incoming Secretary of the DPS had agreed that the reassignment shouldn't have happened was admissible in an administrative hearing to show the declarant's existing mental state and motive. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Ledford, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 266, 786 S.E.2d 50 (2016).

       Reliance on Paper Presented in Hearing on Prior Rate Filing.
   
   - While it is the better practice to produce a witness in a rate-making hearing rather than to rely on exhibits furnished by the witness in earlier hearings, the Commissioner of Insurance did not commit prejudicial error in a homeowners' insurance rate hearing in taking official notice of a paper presented by a witness in a hearing on a prior rate filing and made a part of the order disapproving the prior filing, where the commissioner gave the rate bureau adequate notice in the notice of public hearing that he would rely on the paper in the present hearing.

        CASE NOTES
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Editor's Note. -
   
<span class="s2">

     Some of the cases below were decided under corresponding provisions of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite> and earlier statutes, or under this Chapter prior to the 1991 amendments thereto.
     <br />

</span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Powers Generally.
   
   - When an agency of State government determines to use the services of a hearing officer (now administrative law judge), it is former G.S. 150A-33 that prescribes his powers. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 262, 300 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 548</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 242 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Proposal for Decision Required of Hearing Officer (Now Administrative Law Judge).
   
   - Under the Administrative Procedure Act, when the services of a hearing officer (now administrative law judge) are used, there must be a "proposal for decision" by the hearing officer. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 262, 300 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 548</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 242 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative Law Judge's Decision Reviewed by Personnel Commission.
   
   - The administrative law judge must render a decision on the motion which is presented, but the administrative law judge's ruling is subject to review by the ultimate factfinder, the Personnel Commission. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 446 S.E.2d 383 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 309</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 635 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Procedural Due Process
   
   - Lumber company was never unconstitutionally deprived of its permit as a result of the state agency failing to provide proper due process, since it was through due process provided by G.S. 150B that the lumber company's permit was reinstated. Godfrey Lumber Co. v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 738, 566 S.E.2d 825, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 435</cite>, 572 S.E.2d 430 (2002).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       For discussion of respective powers and duties of Commissioner of Insurance and his designated hearing officer
   
   in the review of filed rates and entry of a final agency decision in a contested insurance rate case, see State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 300 S.E.2d 845 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Commissioner of Insurance Has No Statutory Power to Issue Restraining Orders or Injunctions.
   
   - The statutes creating the Department of Insurance and prescribing the powers and duties of the Commissioner do not purport to grant him the power of issuing restraining orders and injunctions. Charlotte Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. State ex rel. Lanier, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 381, 192 S.E.2d 57 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Commissioner May Apply to the Courts Therefor.
   
   - In administering the laws relative to the insurance industry, the Commissioner, if he deems it necessary, may apply to the courts for restraining orders and injunctions. Charlotte Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. State ex rel. Lanier, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 381, 192 S.E.2d 57 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Attempted grant to the Commissioner of Insurance of judicial power
   
   to impose a penalty upon an insurance agent for a violation of the insurance laws, varying in the Commissioner's discretion from a nominal sum to $25,000, violated N.C. Const., Art. IV, there being no reasonable necessity for conferring such judicial power upon the Commissioner. State ex rel. Lanier v. Vines, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 486</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 161 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority to Determine Validity of Rules.
   
   - This section provides that an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) may determine that a rule as applied in a particular case is void; however, it does not authorize an ALJ to make a final decision with respect to the validity of agency rules. Fearrington v. University of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 774, 487 S.E.2d 169 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Resources, Division of Facility Services, Certificate of Need Section, denied a health system's request for a certificate of need (CON) to build a hospital and granted a CON to the system's competitor, an administrative law judge was authorized to find that 10A N.C. Admin. Code 14C.2303(3), regarding findings of the utilization of computerized axial tomography equipment in a geographic area, was "void as applied" to the facts because the rule required consideration of the health system's underutilization of such equipment in a hospital that was about to close in determining whether to authorize the competitor to install such equipment in the hospital the competitor proposed for the area, and the system's underutilization was irrelevant to the area's need for such equipment, and G.S. 150B-33(b)(9)(3) allowed the administrative law judge to find that a rule was void in a particular case because the rule was not reasonably necessary to enable an agency to fulfill a duty delegated to the agency by the general assembly. Good Hope Health Sys., LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 68, 658 S.E.2d 665, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 470</cite>, 666 S.E.2d 484 (2008).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative Law Judge Had Authority to Award Attorneys' Fees.
   
   - Court of appeals erred in invalidating an administrative law judge's decision to award back pay and attorneys' fees to a county department of social services employee because the judge had express statutory authority to award back pay and attorneys' fees to the employee; the absence of any reference to an attorneys' fee award in subdivision (b)(11) had no bearing upon the proper resolution of the issue of whether the judge had the authority to award attorneys' fees to the employee. Rouse v. Forsyth Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 409</cite>, 838 S.E.2d 390 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that G.S. 150B-33(b)(11) makes no reference to the making of an attorneys' fee award to a wrongfully discharged local government employee has no bearing upon the issue of whether such an award is authorized for unlawfully discharged local government employees by the North Carolina Human Resources Act, G.S. 126-34.02(e). Rouse v. Forsyth Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 409</cite>, 838 S.E.2d 390 (2020).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary Judgment.
   
   - When a provider contested granting a certificate of need to a competitor, an administrative law judge could grant summary judgment because (1) G.S. 131E-188(a) did not give the provider an unconditional right to a hearing, as the right was contingent on a valid petition, and (2) G.S. 150B-33(b)(3a) and G.S. 150B-34(e) allowed summary judgment. Cumberland County Hosp. Sys. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 764 S.E.2d 491 (2014).

      432.10(e)(3) with regard to final decisions in administrative hearings. The waiver application shall include the following:

     <p>
      "(1) The waiver request is made at the direction of the North Carolina General Assembly, which is responsible for the organizational structure of State government.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The single State agency requirement prevents the establishment of the most effective and efficient arrangement for providing administrative hearings to claimants because it requires that after a hearing and decision by an administrative law judge, the case must be returned to the agency for a final decision. The return to the agency is an unnecessary, time-consuming, and costly additional step.

   - When an agency of State government determined to use the services of a hearing officer (now administrative law judge), it was former G.S. 150A-33 that prescribed his powers. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 262, 300 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 548</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 242 (1983), decided under corresponding provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative law judge's (ALJ) conclusion that an agency did not establish just cause for a state employee's dismissal was upheld because (1) the ALJ did not have to defer to the agency in finding if just cause existed, as the agency had the burden to show just cause, and (2) substantial evidence supported the ALJ's factual findings that the employee's unacceptable personal conduct did not warrant the sanction of dismissal, making those findings binding on appeal, as the ALJ was the sole fact-finder. Harris v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 798 S.E.2d 127, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 386</cite>, 808 S.E.2d 142, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 1020 (2017).

      <p>
       Proposal for Decision Required.
   
   - Under the Administrative Procedure Act, when the services of a hearing officer (now administrative law judge) are used, there must be a "proposal for decision" by the hearing officer. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 262, 300 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 548</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 242 (1983), decided under corresponding provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>.

       New Evidence Admissible at Medicaid Hearing.
   
   - In a medicaid case, an Administrative Law Judge properly admitted evidence about the patient's medical needs that was not provided to the agency by his case manager before the initial agency decision to modify and reduce services. Under 26 N.C. Admin. Code
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   3.0122(1)(1), the ALJ could admit all evidence that had probative value. Robinson v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 715 S.E.2d 569 (2011).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative Law Judge's Decision Reviewed by Personnel Commission.
   
   - The administrative law judge must render a decision on the motion which is presented, but the administrative law judge's ruling is subject to review by the ultimate factfinder, the Personnel Commission. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 446 S.E.2d 383 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 309</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 635 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No statutory authority exists for the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] to review an administrative law judge's recommended decision
   
   in a case involving an exempt employee. Johnson v. Natural Resources &amp; Community Dev., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 391 S.E.2d 48, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 140</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 176 (1990), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 689</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 469 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative agency's failure to comply with the mandate of G.S. 150B-34(c) and address all unadopted findings of an administrative law judge (ALJ) in its final agency decision
   
   prejudiced a party's right to meaningful appellate review to the limited extent that the party was not afforded the opportunity to address the agency's reasoning for rejecting material and essential findings by the ALJ. Upon remand, the agency was to address all unadopted findings of the ALJ in its final agency decision. Mission Hosps., Inc. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 263, 658 S.E.2d 277 (2008).

       Standard of Review for Certificate of Need.
   
   - Final sentence of G.S. 150B-34(c) exempts certificate of need proceedings from the newly amended portions of G.S. 150B-51 and requires an appellate court to review those decisions under the previous version of G.S. 150B-51. Total Renal Care of N.C. LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 615 S.E.2d 81 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Deference Based on Specialized Knowledge of Agency.
   
   - Administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in failing to give deference to the reasonable explanation of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section (the Agency) for its decision to exclude hospital-affiliated facilities from its calculation of the county average based on its specialized knowledge because the evidence presented at the hearing corroborated the Agency's assertion that hospital-affiliated facilities typically had significantly fewer Medicaid patients than other skilled nursing facilities within Wake County and artificially skewed the county average. AH N.C. Owner LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 771 S.E.2d 537 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Agency Decision Reversed.
   
   - Final agency decision of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), which upheld two settlement agreements between the DHHS Certificate of Need (CON) section and a group of medical centers and issued a CON to the group for a hospital project was reversed on appeal, because the DHHS failed to follow statutory procedure when it rejected an administrative law judge's recommendation to deny the CON applications of the group by erroneously considering new evidence, which it had no statutory authority to do. Mooresville Hosp. Mgmt. Assocs. v. N.C. HHS, Div. of Facility Servs., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 641, 611 S.E.2d 431 (2005).

       Remand Required Where Findings Are Found Insufficient.
   
   - Where, on review of an order of a state commission permitting petitioner savings and loan association to open a branch office, the trial court determined that the commission's findings were insufficient in that they lacked the specificity required by this section, the trial court should never have reached the question of whether reversal under former G.S. 150A-51(5) was appropriate, as remand for further findings was essential upon concluding that the findings of record presented an inadequate basis for review. Under no applicable theory of law would it be appropriate for the trial court to reverse the commission and substitute its judgment for the commission's. Community Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. North Carolina Sav. &amp; Loan Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 259 S.E.2d 373 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Case was remanded because the final decision did not indicate that the conduct of a technician who worked for a county department of social services amounted to unacceptable personal conduct, and no conclusion of law asserted the department had substantive just cause for any disciplinary action; the ALJ had to make findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding whether the conduct was unacceptable personal conduct, and whether it amounted to just cause for the disciplinary action taken. Watlington v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. Rockingham Cnty., <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 512, 799 S.E.2d 396 (2017), overruled on other grounds, Rouse v. Forsyth Cty. Dep't of Soc.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative agencies should be encouraged to continue cases under active deliberation until rendition of a final decision,
   
   to assure that that decision is the product of adequate, sound deliberation. In re Alamance Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 326, 280 S.E.2d 748, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 588</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 148 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Final agency decision in writing envisioned by former G.S. 150A-36 was not merely a memorialization
   
   of the decision, but was the decision itself, without which agency action did not become final. In re Alamance Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 326, 280 S.E.2d 748, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 588</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 148 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (b) of this section, a final agency decision in a contested case hearing must be based on the official record
   
   prepared pursuant to G.S. 150B-37l; the agency is not permitted to hear new evidence, and if it does so, the trial court on review is required to reverse or remand the agency decision. Everhart &amp; Assocs. v. Department of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 493 S.E.2d 66 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 575</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 590 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Local Appointing Authority.
   
   - A "local appointing authority," within the meaning of G.S. 126-37 (now repealed), is required to render its decision in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. Cunningham v. Catawba County, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 493 S.E.2d 82 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       DSS was required, in rejecting the recommended decision of the Commission, to state the specific reasons why it did not adopt the recommended decision and serve a copy of its final decision on the petitioner; however, because the legislature did not specifically require that the "local appointing authority" comply with subsection (b), there was no obligation to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law, as required by subsection (b). Cunningham v. Catawba County, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 493 S.E.2d 82 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In discrimination cases, G.S. 126-37(b1)
   (now repealed) and G.S. 150B-36 provide that when the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] makes a finding of discrimination, this is binding upon the local appointing authority; the case is then subject to judicial review. Due process concerns are not as strong in discrimination cases because the local appointing authority will never have an opportunity to reverse a finding of discrimination by the State Personnel Commission. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 595 S.E.2d 744 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty of Agency to Allow Adequate Opportunity to File Exceptions.
   
   - This section places an affirmative duty on the agency to allow parties an adequate opportunity to file exceptions to the recommended decision, but in no way obligates parties to file specific exceptions to the recommended decision before issuance of the final agency decision. Owen v. UNC-G Physical Plant, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 682, 468 S.E.2d 813, discretionary review improvidently allowed, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 73</cite>, 477 S.E.2d 33 (1996).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) simply provides the parties with an opportunity to file written exceptions
   
   and/or written arguments; it does not create an additional exhaustion hurdle. Jackson v. Department of Admin., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 490 S.E.2d 248 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Obligation to File Specific Exceptions.
   
   - Although this section places an affirmative duty on the agency to provide the opportunity to file exceptions to the parties, the plain language in no way obligates petitioners to file specific exceptions to the recommended decision before issuance of the final agency decision. Jackson v. Department of Admin., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 490 S.E.2d 248 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision Not Made on Unlawful Procedure.
   
   - A decision of the State Board of Elections ordering a new election for certain county officers was not made on "unlawful procedure" without findings of fact where the chairman orally announced the board's decision on December 6, 1978, to order a new election because of irregularities in assistance rendered to persons who voted by absentee ballots and in the collection and return of voted absentee ballots; a written decision was filed on the same day incorporating the oral decision; and order was entered December 14, 1978, setting a date for the new election and setting out the rules and procedures for its conduct; and on February 13, 1979, the state board filed a written order containing its findings of fact and conclusions of law.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Service of Final Decision.
   
   - Plain language of G.S. 150B-36(b3) and G.S. 150B-42(a) applies to agencies, not the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings, and there was no requirement that the Office of Administrative Hearings serve a final decision personally or by certified mail; in any event, a day care did not deny receiving a copy of the final decision and its substantial rights were not prejudiced in any way. Lincoln v. N.C. HHS, Nutrition Branch, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 616 S.E.2d 622 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       University of North Carolina's State Residence Committee (SRC)
   
   is exempt from the entire Administrative Procedure Act; therefore, although provisions in the act requiring judicial review of final administrative review were applicable, the SRC was not governed by this section, which requires agencies to state reasons for their decisions. Wilson v. State Residence Comm., <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 374 S.E.2d 415 (1988), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 252</cite>, 377 S.E.2d 764 (1989).

      </p>
      <p>
       Recusal From Decision Review.
   
   - Failure of the Director of the Division of Facility Services [now the Division of Health Service Regulation] of DHHS to recuse herself from reviewing her own decision did not amount to a violation of the applicant's competitor's due process rights. Bio-Medical Applications of N.C. Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, Div. of Facility Servs., Certificate of Need Section, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C.

       Administrative Law Judge's Decision Reviewed by Personnel Commission.
   
   - The administrative law judge must render a decision on the motion which is presented, but the administrative law judge's ruling is subject to review by the ultimate factfinder, the Personnel Commission. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 446 S.E.2d 383 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 309</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 635 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No statutory authority exists for the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] to review an administrative law judge's recommended decision
   
   in a case involving an exempt employee. Johnson v. Natural Resources &amp; Community Dev., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 391 S.E.2d 48 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Adequately Explain Rejection of Administrative Law Judge's Decision.
   
   - In light of the fact that the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services had never revoked licenses of ambulance providers for understaffing their ambulances and had no guidelines for such license revocation, the Department failed to explain adequately both its revocation of a provider's license for understaffing and its rejection of an administrative law judge's decision to stay revocation, as required by G.S. 150B-36(b1). Cape Med. Transp., Inc. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 14, 590 S.E.2d 8 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal Proper.
   
   - Substantial evidence in the record supported an administrative law judge's findings and its dismissal of a day care's petition for a contested case hearing where the day care filed nothing in nearly six months following the filing of the petition, despite receiving several orders from the administrative law judge to file and serve prehearing statements and other responses to motions. Lincoln v. N.C. HHS, Nutrition Branch, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 616 S.E.2d 622 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary Judgment.
   
   - When a provider contested granting a certificate of need to a competitor, an administrative law judge could grant summary judgment because (1) G.S. 131E-188(a) did not give the provider an unconditional right to a hearing, as the right was contingent on a valid petition, and (2) G.S. 150B-33(b)(3a) and G.S. 150B-34(e) allowed summary judgment. Cumberland County Hosp. Sys. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 764 S.E.2d 491 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Memorandum of Consideration Not Final Decision.
   
   - Trial court properly held that an administrative law judge's (ALJ's) recommended decision became the final decision of the North Carolina State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] where the Commission was evenly divided and its Memorandum of Consideration did not recite any findings of fact or conclusions of law; as the Memorandum of Consideration did not constitute a final decision, the Commission failed to make a final decision within the time set forth in G.S. 150B-44 and in order to protect the employee from unreasonable delay resulting from the Commission's failure to issue a final decision, the ALJ's recommended decision became the final decision by operation of law.

       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Adjustment Not Required to Sound-Record Hearings.
   
   - Municipal corporations are specifically excluded from requirements under former G.S. 150A-37 and former G.S. 150A-29 that trial rules of evidence and production of evidence be followed in proceedings before State agencies. Thus a Board of Adjustment is not required to sound-record its hearings. Washington Park Neighborhood Ass'n v. Winston-Salem Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 241 S.E.2d 872, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 91</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 263 (1978), decided under corresponding provisions of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No statutory authority exists for the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] to review an administrative law judge's recommended decision
   
   in a case involving an exempt employee. Johnson v. Natural Resources &amp; Community Dev., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 391 S.E.2d 48 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Official Record Required.
   
   - Under G.S. 150B-36(b), a final agency decision in a contested case hearing must be based on the official record prepared pursuant to this section; the agency is not permitted to hear new evidence, and if it does so, the trial court on review is required to reverse or remand the agency decision. Everhart &amp; Assocs. v. Department of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 493 S.E.2d 66 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 575</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 590 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Offers of Proof Part of Official Record.
   
   - Commission properly considered offers of proof included in the record since offers of proof are part of the official record under subdivision (a)(2) of this section and not "new evidence" violative of G.S. 150B-51(a). Everhart &amp; Assocs. v. Department of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C.

       Applicability of Article.
   
   - Article 3 of the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act applies to administrative hearings conducted by the Office of Administrative Hearings before an administrative law judge, while Article 3A applies to "other administrative hearings" which are conducted by state agencies enumerated in this section. Homoly v. North Carolina State Bd. of Dental Examrs., <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 695, 468 S.E.2d 481 (1996).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Action Sufficient to Trigger Contested Case Provisions.
   
   - Petitioner's letter, requesting expungement of a record, and requesting an opportunity to meet with the administrative board, was sufficient to trigger the contested case provisions of this section, and respondent's subsequent denial of the request constituted agency action on a contested case which affected the substantive rights of petitioner. In re Sullivan, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 795, 436 S.E.2d 862 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Revocation of Law Enforcement Officer's License.
   
   - Petitioner was entitled to both notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the revocation of his license as a law enforcement officer by the Criminal Justice Education and Training Standards Commission, where such adjudicatory action constituted agency action on a contested case affecting substantive rights. Scroggs v. North Carolina Criminal Justice Educ. &amp; Training Stds. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 699, 400 S.E.2d 742 (1991) (decided prior to the 1991 amendments to this Chapter).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Charges Against Licensees of a Board.
   
   - The General Assembly intended that any person who prefers charges against, inter alia, a licensee of the Board is entitled to a hearing and decision on those charges. Bryant v. North Carolina State Bd. of Exmrs. of Elec. Contractors, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 288</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 188 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice of disciplinary hearings by the North Carolina Psychology Board must be given not less than 15 days before the hearing, under G.S. 150B-38(b); under G.S. 150B-40(a), such hearings shall be conducted in a fair and impartial manner and the parties shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on issues of fact, examine and cross-examine witnesses, including the author of a document prepared by, on behalf of or for the use of the agency and offered into evidence, submit rebuttal evidence, and present arguments on issues of law or policy. Farber v. N.C. Psychology Bd., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 569 S.E.2d 287 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 612</cite>, 574 S.E.2d 679 (2002).

      <p>
       Board of Examiners of Electrical Contractors Required to Hold Hearing.
   
   - Though the language is not explicit in requiring that the Board of Examiners of Electrical Contractors hold a hearing on charges, such a requirement is implicit both in the language referring to "hearings of charges" and in the stated purpose of the statute governing the jurisdiction of the Board to hear such charges. Bryant v. North Carolina State Bd. of Exmrs. of Elec. Contractors, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 288</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 188 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Majority of Board.
   
   - Administrative hearing revoking a funeral home license was conducted by a "majority of the agency," as required by G.S. 150B-40(b); although only four members of the nine-member board were present for the entire hearing, which was held in two parts, a majority was present on each occasion. Wilson Funeral Dirs., Inc. v. N.C. Bd. of Funeral Serv., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 768, 781 S.E.2d 507 (2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Intent of Statute Mandated Hearing.
   
   - It would be contrary to the intent expressed in G.S. 87-47(a1), that of protecting the public, to determine that plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing and decision on charges brought to effectuate that very purpose. Bryant v. North Carolina State Bd. of Exmrs. of Elec. Contractors, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 288</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 188 (1994).

       Applicability of G.S. 150B-23(a).
   
   - Subsection (a) of G.S. 150B-23, as amended by Session Laws 1987, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.878.html" target="_blank">Chapter 878</a></cite>, is not applicable to agencies governed by Article 3A of this Chapter.

       Intended Sanction Not Required in Notice of Hearing.
   
   - While subdivision (b)(2) of this section requires licensing boards to include in their notices a reference to the particular sections of the statutes and rules involved, it does not appear to require a board to state which sanction under the applicable disciplinary statute it intends to impose. However, once a board states with specificity that it is proposing to impose only one or two sanctions available under a referenced disciplinary statute for the stated alleged infractions, the board is then precluded from imposing a greater sanction for these infractions. Miller v. North Carolina State Bd. of Registration for Professional Eng'rs &amp; Land Surveyors, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 465</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 605 (1988).

       Changes Against Licensees of a Board.
   
   - The General Assembly intended that any person who prefers charges against, inter alia, a licensee of a board is entitled to a hearing and decision on those charges. Bryant v. North Carolina State Bd. of Exmrs. of Elec. Contractors, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 288</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 188 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice of disciplinary hearings by the North Carolina Psychology Board must be given not less than 15 days before the hearing, under G.S. 150B-38(b); under G.S. 150B-40(a), such hearings shall be conducted in a fair and impartial manner and the parties shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on issues of fact, examine and cross-examine witnesses, including the author of a document prepared by, on behalf of or for the use of the agency and offered into evidence, submit rebuttal evidence, and present arguments on issues of law or policy. Farber v. N.C. Psychology Bd., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 569 S.E.2d 287 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 612</cite>, 574 S.E.2d 679 (2002).

       Intent of Statute Mandated Hearing.
   
   - It would be contrary to the intent expressed in G.S. 87-47(a1), that of protecting the public, to determine that plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing and decision on charges brought to effectuate that very purpose. Bryant v. North Carolina State Bd. of Exmrs. of Elec. Contractors, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 288</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 188 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Spirit Not Violated
   
   - Under the plain language of G.S. 150B-40(d), the prohibition on ex parte communication by agency members "begins at the time of the notice of hearing;" where the probable cause hearing took place two months before the North Carolina Psychology Board issued its statement of charges, and nine months before it issued the notice of hearing, as the probable cause hearing occurred well before the statutory prohibition on ex parte communications arose, the trial court erred in concluding that the Board violated the spirit of G.S. 150B-40(d). Farber v. N.C. Psychology Bd., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 569 S.E.2d 287 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 612</cite>, 574 S.E.2d 679 (2002).

     <p>
      Any party or person aggrieved by the final decision in a contested case, and who has exhausted all administrative remedies made available to the party or person aggrieved by statute or agency rule, is entitled to judicial review of the decision under this Article, unless adequate procedure for judicial review is provided by another statute, in which case the review shall be under such other statute. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent any party or person aggrieved from invoking any judicial remedy available to the party or person aggrieved under the law to test the validity of any administrative action not made reviewable under this Article. A party or person aggrieved shall not be required to petition an agency for rule making or to seek or obtain a declaratory ruling before obtaining judicial review of a final decision or order made pursuant to G.S. 150B-34.

        Construction with Other Provisions.
   
   - Section 113A-123 does not set forth the scope of review but instead provides that judicial review is available pursuant to the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the Administrative Procedure Act. Friends of Hatteras Island Nat'l Historic Maritime Forest Land Trust for Preservation, Inc. v. Coastal Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 556, 452 S.E.2d 337 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Procedures and requirements of the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act, G.S. 150B-1 et seq., were not to be incorporated into the statutory requirements under G.S. 53-92(d) for an appeal from a final decision of the North Carolina State Banking Commission. In re Advance Am., Cash Advance Ctrs. of N.C. Inc., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 657 S.E.2d 405 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act, G.S. 150B-1 through 150B-52, was inapplicable to the review of decisions by a hearing officer of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services regarding Medicaid emergency medical benefits because G.S. 108A-79(k) governed the review of the decisions. Meza v. Div. of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 668 S.E.2d 571 (2008), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 61</cite>, 692 S.E.2d 96 N.C. LEXIS 343 (2010).

       <p>
        Trial court had jurisdiction under G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 70, to decide whether its previous order was being violated where that order had determined that the Medicaid recipient was to continue to receive benefits under the categorically needy eligibility group until he was determined to be ineligible under the rules as modified by that order, the decision to terminate his benefits under a program for which he appeared eligible squarely raised the issue of whether the agency had acted as a disobedient party, and neither the APA nor G.S. 108A-79 provided for administrative review of the alleged violation of the court order. Pachas v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 12</cite>, 822 S.E.2d 847 (2019).

        <b>
         Requirements for Judicial Review Generally.
        </b>
        - Former G.S. 150A-43 requires a four-part test for standing: an aggrieved party, a final agency decision, a contested case, and exhaustion of administration remedies. Warren County v. North Carolina, 528 F. Supp. 276 (E.D.N.C. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are five requirements under former G.S. 150A-43: (1) plaintiff must be an aggrieved person; (2) there must be a final agency decision; (3) the decision must result from a contested case; (4) petitioner must have exhausted administrative remedies; and (5) there must be no other adequate procedure for judicial review. Dyer v. Bradshaw, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 282 S.E.2d 548 (1981); State ex rel. Tenn. Dep't of Health &amp; Env't v. Environmental Mgt. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 338 S.E.2d 781 (1986); In re Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 354 S.E.2d 374 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has been interpreted as imposing five requirements in order to have standing for judicial review: (1) the petitioner must be an aggrieved party; (2) there must be a final agency decision; (3) the decision must result from a contested case; (4) the petitioner must have exhausted all administrative remedies; and (5) there must be no other adequate procedure for judicial review. Charlotte Truck Driver School, Inc. v. North Carolina DMV, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 381 S.E.2d 861 (1989); Meads v. North Carolina Dep't of Agric., <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 656</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 165 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether the jurisdictional prerequisites of the Administrative Procedure Act have been met
   
   is not a question of personal jurisdiction, but one of the ripeness, on a case by base basis, of the subject matter of administrative decisions for judicial review. Poret v. State Personnel Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 536, 328 S.E.2d 880, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 117</cite>, 332 S.E.2d 491, 332 S.E.2d 492 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Batten v. N.C. Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 338</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 35 (1990), overruled on other grounds, Empire Power Co. v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 569</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 168 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Standing Is Question of Subject Matter Jurisdiction.
   
   - Whether one has standing to obtain judicial review of an administrative decision is a question of subject matter jurisdiction. Carter v. North Carolina State Bd. of Registration, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 308, 357 S.E.2d 705 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No statutory authority exists for the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] to review an administrative law judge's recommended decision
   
   in a case involving an exempt employee. Johnson v. Natural Resources &amp; Community Dev., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 391 S.E.2d 48, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 140</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 176 (1990), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 689</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 469 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrative Remedy is Exclusive.
   
   - When the General Assembly provides an effective administrative remedy by statute, that remedy is exclusive, and the party must pursue and exhaust it before resorting to the courts. Jackson v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources Div. of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, &amp; Substance Abuse Servs., <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 505 S.E.2d 899 (1998), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 594</cite>, 537 S.E.2d 213 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirements for Judicial Review Generally.
   
   - This section has been interpreted as imposing five requirements in order to have standing for judicial review: (1) the petitioner must be an aggrieved party; (2) there must be a final agency decision; (3) the decision must result from a contested case; (4) the petitioner must have exhausted all administrative remedies; and (5) there must be no other adequate procedure for judicial review. Charlotte Truck Driver School, Inc. v. North Carolina DMV, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 381 S.E.2d 861 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Record Must Indicate Basis for Exercise of Discretion.
   
   - While it is true that the determination whether by common judgment certain conduct is disqualifying is left to the sound discretion of the board, the record must include an indication of the basis upon which the board or other agency exercised its expert discretion. Dailey v. North Carolina State Bd. of Dental Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 710</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 219 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Corresponding former provisions were inappropriate to initiate an attack upon the constitutionality of a statute
   
   fixing the powers and duties of the Board of Paroles (now Parole Commission). The question of the constitutionality of a statute is not for administrative boards, but for the judicial branch. Jernigan v. State, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 556</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 259 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Review of Executive Interpretation of Statute Not Authorized.
   
   - Corresponding former provisions did not authorize the filing of a petition in the superior court seeking an advisory opinion on the correctness of an executive interpretation of a statute. Housing Auth. v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 76</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 121 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon review pursuant to former G.S. 150A-43, the "whole record" test is applicable,
   
   and the decision of the State Board of Alcoholic Control may be reversed if substantial rights of the licensee are prejudiced by administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions which are not supported by competent, material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted. Fay v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 227 S.E.2d 298, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 175</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 689 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The clear intent of the legislature is to make the "whole record" test the principal standard of judicial review of administrative findings in this State. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Scope of Review Must Be Defined.
   
   - In presenting appeals to the judicial branch from State administrative agencies, it is essential that the parties present their contentions as to the applicable scope of judicial review; likewise, the reviewing court should make clear the review standard under which it proceeds. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Bird Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 14</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 232 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrative Procedure Act does not preclude entirely the possibility of judicial review by use of the Declaratory Judgment Act or other procedures
   
   outside the act. High Rock Lake Ass'n v. North Carolina Envtl. Mgt. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 699, 252 S.E.2d 109 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Quasi-Judicial Hearing Contemplated.
   
   - Former provisions contemplated a quasi-judicial hearing in which the parties were permitted an opportunity to offer evidence and a decision was rendered applicable to a specific factual situation. Housing Auth. v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 76</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 121 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An agency's denial of a petition for rule making
   
   under former G.S. 150A-16 is subject to judicial review pursuant to the provisions of former G.S. 150A-43. In re Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 354 S.E.2d 374 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Doctrine of Res Judicata.
   
   - Where an administrative determination has been reviewed by the courts, the res judicata effect, if any, attaches to the court's judgment rather than to the administrative decision. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Thornburg, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 463</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 451 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mandatory Suspension of Driving Privilege.
   
   - Petitioner whose driving privilege was mandatorily suspended under G.S. 20-17(2) and G.S. 20-19(e) did not have the right to appeal under G.S. 20-25 or under this Chapter. However, the superior court could review the actions of the Commissioner by issuing a writ of certiorari. Davis v. Hiatt, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 462</cite>, 390 S.E.2d 338 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the right to drive has been mandatorily revoked
   
   and a petitioner unsuccessfully seeks to have the license reinstated by the DMV, no superior court review of the denial is mandated unless the denial was arbitrary or illegal, because reinstatement is not a legal right but is an act of grace. Alpiser v. Eagle Pontiac-GMC-Isuzu, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 389 S.E.2d 293 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The superior court acquired jurisdiction to award attorney fees
   
   when a reinstated employee petitioned for review of a final agency decision. Early v. County of Durham, Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 667 S.E.2d 512 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 372</cite>, 678 S.E.2d 237 (2009).

         II. AGGRIEVED PERSON.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Meaning of "Person Aggrieved".
   
   - The expression "person aggrieved" has no technical meaning. What it means depends on the circumstances involved. In re Halifax Paper Co., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 589</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 441 (1963); Albemarle Elec. Membership Corp. v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 402</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 811 (1972); Orange County Sensible Hwys. &amp; Protected Env'ts, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 265 S.E.2d 890 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Person aggrieved" means one who is adversely affected in respect of legal rights, or is suffering from an infringement or denial of legal rights. Carter v. North Carolina State Bd. of Registration, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 308, 357 S.E.2d 705 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Personal Rights or Interests Not at Issue.
   
   - Where none of petitioner's personal rights or interests, nor any rights or interests properly attributable to him in a cognizable representative capacity, were either directly or indirectly at issue in requested rule making proceeding, he was not substantially affected by Department of Human Resources' denial of his petition for rule making. Therefore, he was not a "person aggrieved" as a result of the agency decision and had no standing to seek judicial review thereof. In re Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 354 S.E.2d 374 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Practitioner was not an "aggrieved party" under G.S. 150B-2(6) and lacked standing to appeal under G.S. 150B-43 because the practitioner's interest in her person, property, or employment were not affected substantially by any administrative action of the North Carolina Respiratory Care Board, which had reversed its decision requiring her to pay monetary penalties. Thompson v. N.C. Respiratory Care Bd., <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 340, 688 S.E.2d 516 (2010), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 132</cite>, 696 S.E.2d 699, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 335 (2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Person Aggrieved in Representative Capacity.
   
   - One may be aggrieved when he is affected only in a representative capacity. In re Halifax Paper Co., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 589</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 441 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrative Agency as Person Aggrieved.
   
   - An administrative agency cannot be a person aggrieved by its own order, but it may be an aggrieved party to secure judicial review of a decision of an administrative reviewing agency. In re Halifax Paper Co., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 589</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 441 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        County as "Person Aggrieved".
   
   - A county may be an aggrieved person when an agency issues a ruling that could affect the county's revenue. In re Brunswick County, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 391, 344 S.E.2d 584 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeals by Public Officials and Governmental Units in Cases Involving Taxation and Public Funds.
   
   - Where statutes permit appeals by persons aggrieved, appeals by public officials and governmental units are usually allowed in cases involving questions of law relating to taxation and public funds. In re Halifax Paper Co., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 589</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 441 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        County as Party Aggrieved.
   
   - A county is a party aggrieved and is entitled to appeal from a decision of the State Board of Assessment (now the Property Tax Commission) reducing the valuation of property appraised by the county for tax purposes. In re Appeal of Harris, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 20</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 539 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         County had standing to challenge establishment of a toxic waste site
        </b>
        within its borders under this Chapter because of the effect on its tax base and planning jurisdiction, because of the final agency determination upon issuance of an environmental impact statement, and because the Environmental Policy Act (Art. 1 of Ch. 113A) includes the right to judicial review of an issue which involves a contested case. Warren County v. North Carolina, 528 F. Supp. 276 (E.D.N.C. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioners Ordered to Forfeit Bid Bond "Aggrieved".
   
   - Petitioners were aggrieved persons when the Secretary of Administration ordered them to forfeit their $316,600.00 bid bond or be subject to liability for twice that amount. In re Metric Constructors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 228 S.E.2d 533 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Property Owners, etc., Within Proposed Corridor of Highway Were Aggrieved.
   
   - Plaintiffs were all "aggrieved" by a decision of the State Board of Transportation on the location of an interstate highway within the meaning of former G.S. 150A-43 where the individual plaintiffs were property owners within the proposed corridor of the highway, the members of plaintiff nonprofit corporation were citizens and taxpayers living in or near the proposed corridor, and plaintiff county's tax base and planning jurisdiction would be affected by the proposed highway. Orange County Sensible Hwys. &amp; Protected Env'ts, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 265 S.E.2d 890 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Procedural injury" implicit in agency failure to prepare an environmental impact statement
   
   as to a proposed highway project was itself a sufficient "injury in fact" to support standing as "aggrieved parties" under former G.S. 150A-43, as long as such injury was alleged by a plaintiff having a sufficient geographical nexus to the site of the challenged project that he might be expected to suffer whatever environmental consequences the project may have. Orange County Sensible Hwys. &amp; Protected Env'ts, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 265 S.E.2d 890 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Impairment of Hearing Rights in Pollution Discharge Permit Proceeding.
   
   - "Procedural injury," whereby petitioner State of Tennessee's right to be heard on certain aspects of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit was substantially impaired, was sufficient under former G.S. 150A-43 to qualify petitioner as an "aggrieved person" for purposes of appeal of issuance of Environmental Management Commission's consent special order with corporation. In addition, where the consent special order contained provisions substantially identical to provisions which petitioner opposed in the proposed NPDES permit, which affected the property rights of the petitioner in the Pigeon River, these allegations also established petitioner's "aggrieved person" status. State ex rel. Tenn. Dep't of Health &amp; Env't v. Environmental Mgt. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 338 S.E.2d 781 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner Who Had Won Case Not Aggrieved Party.
   
   - Where, although petitioner claimed that it had attempted to preserve a cross-assignment of error, the Commissioner's decision in petitioner's favor was upheld both in the trial court and by the court of appeals; the petitioner was not a party aggrieved. GMC v. Carolina Truck &amp; Body Co., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 349, 402 S.E.2d 139 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Person Not Aggrieved.
   
   - Trial court did not err in refusing to conduct judicial review of a lobbyist's request for review because there was no longer any controversy once the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State decided to not apply aggravating factors to the lobbyist's fine; thus, the trial court properly concluded that the case was moot regardless of whether the lobbyist was a "person aggrieved" pursuant to G.S. 150B-4 and G.S. 150B-43. Beason v. N.C. Dep't of the Secy. of State, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 741 S.E.2d 663 (2013).

       <p>
        A "contested case" means
   
   an administrative proceeding pursuant to this Chapter to resolve a dispute between an agency and another person that involves the person's rights, duties, or privileges, including licensing or the levy of a monetary penalty. State ex rel. Envtl. Mgt. Comm'n v. House of Raeford Farms, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 433, 400 S.E.2d 107 (1991), discretionary review denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 576</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 521 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A contested case hearing is distinguishable from a contested case.
   
   The phrase "contested case" extends beyond an adjudicatory hearing to include any agency proceeding, by whatever name called, wherein the legal rights, duties and privileges of a party are required by law to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing. Community Psychiatric Ctrs. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 405 S.E.2d 769 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Proceeding Sufficient to Constitute a "Contested Case."
   
   - The Superior Court had jurisdiction over a petition for review of denial of services under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, P.L. 102-569, 42 U.S.C.
   <span class="s1">

   701, et seq. as amended, where, although the petitioner's claims were not heard by an Administrative Law Judge, they were heard by an agency hearing officer, at a proceeding in which petitioner and respondent were allowed to submit and cross-examine evidence and where respondent's director reviewed and affirmed the hearing officer's decision, in accordance with its own regulations. Hedgepeth v. North Carolina Div. of Servs. for the Blind, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 338, 543 S.E.2d 169 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Case challenging a consent special order
   
   entered into by Environmental Management Commission and a corporation, which order was alleged to intrude upon the NPDES permit process (which process requires a hearing), was "contested" for the purposes of former G.S. 150A-43. State ex rel. Tenn. Dep't of Health &amp; Env't v. Environmental Mgt. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 338 S.E.2d 781 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision of State Board of Transportation as to location of an interstate highway constituted a "contested case"
   
   within the meaning of former G.S. 150A-43, where the North Carolina Environmental Policy Act, G.S. 113A-1 through 113A-10, was involved. Orange County Sensible Hwys. &amp; Protected Env'ts, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 265 S.E.2d 890 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where rights of petitioner were determined by an in-person interview and by an investigation
   
   conducted by a hearing officer of the North Carolina DMV, a state agency, they constituted "an agency proceeding." Therefore, the case was "contested" for purposes of this section. Charlotte Truck Driver Training School, Inc. v. North Carolina DMV, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 381 S.E.2d 861 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The result of a petitioner's ineffective attempts to file a petition
   
   for a contested case hearing was only a contested case. Community Psychiatric Ctrs. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 405 S.E.2d 769 (1991).

       <p>
        In General.
   
   - Under the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act, an aggrieved party has the right to judicial review of a final agency decision in a contested case. Okale v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 570 S.E.2d 741 (2002).
   <br />
       </p>

        Decision to end a preliminary inquiry is not "a final agency decision in a contested case."
   
   Lloyd v. Babb, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Dismissal of State Employee.
   
   - A recommendation by the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] is not a final decision from which a party may petition for judicial review; thus, the superior court was without jurisdiction to uphold a recommendation by the State Personnel Commission prior to review by the Local Appointing Authority, which ultimately reversed the recommendation. Howell v. Morton, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 508 S.E.2d 804 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision by State Board of Transportation to deny plaintiffs a hearing concerning location of an interstate highway was a "final" decision
   
   within the meaning of former G.S. 150A-43, since the decision affected a right which plaintiffs had pursuant to the board's own administrative regulations. Orange County Sensible Hwys. &amp; Protected Env'ts, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 265 S.E.2d 890 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delay Caused by Order for Rehearing Insufficient to Make Order a Final Decision.
   
   - Delay caused when the full State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] ordered a rehearing of a dismissal case involving an employee of the Department of Transportation after declining to accept the recommendation of the hearing officer that a default be entered against the Department for its failure to appear was not an undue delay within the meaning of former G.S. 150A-23(a), nor such a delay as could allow the Court of Appeals to treat the order for rehearing as a final agency decision under former G.S. 150A-43. Davis v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 250 S.E.2d 64 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 735</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 177 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Claim as to Statute's Unconstitutionality Involved No "Decision".
   
   - Plaintiffs could not obtain judicial review under former G.S. 150A-43 of their claim that G.S. 143B-350(f)(8), conferring on the State Board of Transportation the power and duty to approve all highway construction programs, unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the board, since the claim involved no agency "decision"; however, such claim could be heard pursuant to N.C. Const., Art. IV,

        Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies Required.
   
   - The Administrative Procedure Act allows judicial review of a final agency decision in a contested case when all relevant administrative remedies have been exhausted and there is no adequate judicial review provided under any other statute. In re Estate of Kapoor, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 102</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 403 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides no authority for permitting plaintiff to bypass the requirements of G.S. 113A-121.1, because by enacting the provisions for administrative review of rules, the legislature wisely determined that the agency itself should have the first opportunity to review the propriety and applicability of its own rules, and so long as the statutory procedures provide an effective means of review of the agency action, the courts will require parties to exhaust their administrative remedies. Leeuwenburg v. Waterway Inv. Ltd. Partnership, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 541, 445 S.E.2d 614 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where board of trustee's decision denying plaintiff's claim was subject to judicial review only under the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act and, at the time he brought the action in the District Court, plaintiff had not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him under the Act, the court of appeals did not err in concluding that the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction and that the plaintiff's civil action must be dismissed. Vass v. Board of Trustees, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 402</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 26 (1989).
       </p>

        As a general rule a party must exhaust all applicable administrative remedies before filing in the superior court. Jackson v. Department of Admin., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 490 S.E.2d 248 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs' challenge to insurance company's assessment of driving record points under the safe driver incentive plan (SDIP) required them to first exhaust their administrative remedies, as the approval of the SDIP was required by the commissioner of insurance and fell within the administrative procedures act. Prentiss v. Allstate Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 404, 548 S.E.2d 557 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Final agency decision regarding whether a county's personnel regulations were substantially equivalent to the North Carolina State Personnel Act [now the North Carolina Human Resources Act], G.S. 126-1 et seq., was reviewable by a trial court only after the aggrieved person had exhausted all available administrative remedies made available by statute or agency rule. Steward v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 131, 657 S.E.2d 719 (2008).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies
   
   is designed to avoid the interruption and cessation of proceedings before a commission by untimely and premature intervention by the courts would completely destroy the efficiency, effectiveness, and purpose of the administrative agencies. Jackson v. Department of Admin., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 490 S.E.2d 248 (1997).

       <p>
        It was error to dismiss, for a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, a claim by state foresters against the state for overtime compensation for time spent fighting forest fires because G.S. 143-300.35(a) authorized the maintenance of a separate action in the trial division of the general courts of justice for claims brought by state employees against state agencies under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.S.

        Judicial Review Precluded by Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.
   
   - Plaintiff collection agency was not entitled to seek a declaratory judgment in the superior court as to the validity and applicability of a regulation of the Department of Insurance prohibiting collection agencies from instituting judicial proceedings on behalf of other persons, where plaintiff failed to exhaust available administrative remedies by petitioning the Department of Insurance for amendment or repeal of the regulation under former G.S. 150A-16 or seeking a declaratory ruling from the Department of Insurance as to the validity and applicability of the regulation under former G.S. 150A-17, and then by seeking judicial review of an adverse Department of Insurance decision under former G.S. 150A-43 et seq.

        The guardian of a child entitled to Medicaid was required to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial review where the child's admission to a hospital was not approved.

        Because a professor did not pursue each level of appeal provided by the university system from his discharge, he did not exhaust his remedies prior to filing a wrongful discharge suit in superior court. Therefore, the superior court lacked jurisdiction to consider his complaint and properly dismissed it under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(1). Johnson v. Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 688 S.E.2d 546 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        University coach's complaint contesting the coach's employment separation was properly dismissed because (1) the coach did not exhaust administrative remedies available under university employment policies, as G.S. 150B-43 required, and (2) the coach's claim that exhausting those remedies would have been unfair to the team did not show inadequacy. Tucker v. Fayetteville State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 188, 767 S.E.2d 60 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Medical practices had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to their Medicaid reimbursement claims where they did not request a reconsideration review or file a petition for a contested case, their claims against a contractor that designed the payment system were intertwined with the claims against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, and the sheer number of claims did not satisfy the medical practices's burden of showing that exhaustion would have been futile.

        Failure to Exhaust Inadequate Remedy Not Required.
   
   - Failure to exhaust an administrative remedy will not bar judicial review if that remedy has been shown to be inadequate. Orange County Sensible Hwys. &amp; Protected Env'ts, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 265 S.E.2d 890 (1980).

        Application of Exhaustion Requirement Not Waived.
   
   - By entering into a Consent Judgment, which resolved ten cases then pending in the courts and the administrative hearing office, the plaintiff did not waive the application of the exhaustion requirement of this Chapter to penalties which would be assessed in the future. State ex rel. Envtl. Mgt. Comm'n v. House of Raeford Farms, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C.

       <p>
        Inadequacy of Administrative Remedies Insufficiently Alleged.
   
   - Employee bringing a breach of employment contract claim against North Carolina Central University (University) inadequately alleged inadequate administrative remedies because (1) the employee's damage claims did not meet this purpose, as the unavailability of damages under G.S. 150B-43 did not make the remedy inadequate, and (2) the fact that only remand to the University was available did not cause the employee's prediction that the University would again rule against the employee to show the remedy was inadequate. Frazier v. N.C. Cent. Univ., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 37, 779 S.E.2d 515 (2015).

        Method of Review for Augmented Tax Review Board's Decision.
   
   - Appellate jurisdiction does not lie in a North Carolina superior court for an Augmented Tax Review Board's (ATRB's) decision; as a result, when a corporation is contesting the application of the apportionment formula before the ATRB, G.S. 105-130.4(t)(6) requires aggrieved corporations to pay the tax and bring an original civil action, thus directing them to G.S. 105-241.4 [repealed], which provides that an aggrieved corporation bypass administrative review and proceed to litigate the tax liability at issue in the superior court de novo pursuant to that court's original jurisdiction.

Section 105-241.3 [repealed] does not impliedly amend former G.S. 150A-43 so as to preclude the right of the Commissioner (now Secretary) to appeal, but the two statutes must be construed together and effect given the provisions of both.

        Breach of Employment Contract Claim Against North Carolina Central University.
   
   - Administrative Procedure Act (APA) applied to an employee's breach of employment contract claim against North Carolina Central University (University), requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies, because the employee's use of a contractual internal appeal process and inability to use the State Personnel Act showed no lack of such remedies, as the University's decisions were reviewable under G.S. 150B-43, the employee's contract did not exempt the employee from the APA, the University did not waive sovereign immunity, and the unavailability of breach of contract damages under the APA did not make such review inadequate.

        Environmental Impact Statement.
   
   - Department of Administration decision that an environmental impact statement was not required did not automatically mean that a permit would be issued by Department of Environmental Health and Natural Resources. Petitioners' action to challenge the decision did not become ripe until Department of Environmental Health and Natural Resources made its decision to issue the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit to applicant. Because petitioners' claim was not ripe at the time of Department of Administration decision, they did not have the right to a contested case hearing. Citizens for Clean Indus., Inc. v.

        Petition Not Sufficiently Explicit.
   
   - Where petition for judicial review of county health director's decision affirming employee's termination lacked even a single exception to particular findings of fact or conclusions of law but instead, baldly asserted only that the health department's decision was "contrary to the Recommended Decision of the Administrative Law Judge and the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission]," petition was not sufficiently explicit to permit effective judicial review of the proceedings, and department's motion to dismiss should have been allowed.

        Appeal Held Moot.
   
   - Trial court properly concluded that a lobbyist's appeal of a decision of the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State was moot because although the Department applied aggravating factors under G.S. 120C-602(b) to enhance a civil fine, it did not enhance the fine in its final agency decision using those factors; therefore, a legal determination of whether the Department had authority to enhance the fine had no practical effect on the controversy.

        Improper Dismissal of Judicial Review Petition.
   
   - Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) decision to uphold permits for the use of coal combustion residual as structural fill at open pit mines was reversed because: (1) the ALJ erred in sua sponte converting a motion for summary judgment into a motion for involuntary dismissal and granting the same, as the ALJ had no such authority, and (2) issues raised by environmental groups required distinctly different reviews of the evidence under the whole record standard and of issues of law under the de novo standard, but it was unclear what standards the trial court applied, as the court reweighed the evidence and rewrote the ALJ's decision without explanation.

     <p>
      Failure of an administrative law judge subject to Article 3 of this Chapter or failure of an agency subject to Article 3A of this Chapter to make a final decision within 120 days of the close of the contested case hearing is justification for a person whose rights, duties, or privileges are adversely affected by the delay to seek a court order compelling action by the agency or by the administrative law judge.

       Due Process Rights Not Violated.
   
   - North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services violated a mother's due process and equal protection rights because although the hearing officer's final decision came some time after the hearing date, the mother's children failed to take advantage of their statutory right to compel the hearing officer to take action; the children were afforded an adequate opportunity to have their concerns addressed in a timely manner, but merely failed to take advantage of that right, and their equal protection rights were not violated by the hearing officer's delay. Cloninger v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 345, 691 S.E.2d 127 (2010), review denied <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 324</cite>, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 1083 (2010).

      <p>
       Decision Held Unreasonably Delayed.
   
   - Trial court did not err in reversing decision by North Carolina State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission]
   as untimely under G.S. 150B-44, and in adopting the administrative law judge's recommended order, due to the delay beyond 60 days in the entry of the Commission's order; the Commission did not seek to extend the time limit by consent or unilaterally when it reconsidered its original order and then reissued its order. Gordon v. N.C. Dep't of Corr., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 618 S.E.2d 280 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly held that an administrative law judge's (ALJ's) recommended decision became the final decision of the North Carolina State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] where the Commission was evenly divided and its Memorandum of Consideration did not recite any findings of fact or conclusions of law; as the Memorandum of Consideration did not constitute a final decision, the Commission failed to make a final decision within the time set forth in G.S. 150B-44 and in order to protect the employee from unreasonable delay resulting from the Commission's failure to issue a final decision, the ALJ's recommended decision became the final decision by operation of law. Teague v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C.

      <p>
       Protection from Unreasonable Delay.
   
   - Parties are protected from unreasonable delay on the part of agencies in reaching final decisions by former G.S. 150A-44 (see now this section), which allows a party adversely affected by such delay to seek a court order compelling action by the agency. In re Alamance Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 326, 280 S.E.2d 748, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 588</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 148 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right under former G.S. 150A-44 (see now this section) may be asserted to prevent unreasonable delay in reaching a final agency decision. Stevenson v. North Carolina Dep't of Ins., <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 229 S.E.2d 209 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision Held Unreasonably Delayed.
   
   - State Personnel Commission's [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission's] decision against a county employee issued 130 days after it had received the official record from the hearing officer was "unreasonably delayed" as defined in this section; however, the hearing officer's decision would not be reinstated. The only available remedy was a court order compelling action by the agency or hearing officer. Davis v. Vance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 428, 372 S.E.2d 88 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Human Resources did not make its final decision within the time limits of this section, where the Department filed an extension, but did not render its final decision until almost six months after it received the record. Holland Group, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Admin., <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 721, 504 S.E.2d 300 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance (HHS), did not properly extend the deadline under G.S. 150B-44 for issuing a final decision regarding an administrative law judge's recommendation that it had improperly withheld Medicaid reimbursements, the judgment of the trial court that HHS adopted the recommendation was affirmed on appeal. Albemarle Mental Health Ctr. v. N.C. Dep't of HHS, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 582 S.E.2d 651 (2003), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 134</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 519 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Self-Executing Decisions
   
   - When an Article 3 administrative agency failed to issue a final decision regarding the recognition of a tribe as an indigenous North Carolina Indian tribe within the time limits set forth in G.S. 150B-44, the recommended decision of an administrative law judge became the final decision in the case by operation of law. Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation v. N.C. Comm'n of Indian Affairs, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 551 S.E.2d 535, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 365</cite>, 556 S.E.2d 575 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Good Cause
   
   - It is the responsibility of an agency governed by G.S. 150B-44 to articulate "good cause" for extending the final decision deadline when there is no agreement by the parties to extend the deadline. Albemarle Mental Health Ctr. v. N.C. Dep't of HHS, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 582 S.E.2d 651 (2003), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 134</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 519 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicability
   
   - Pursuant to G.S. 150B-1(c), the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance, is an Article 3 agency and thereby subject to the mandates of G.S. 150B-44. Albemarle Mental Health Ctr. v. N.C. Dep't of HHS, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 582 S.E.2d 651 (2003), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 134</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 519 (2004).

       Office of Administrative Hearings was not the appropriate forum for review of a virtual charter school applicant's challenge to the State Board of Education's inaction on its application where the applicant had not followed the G.S. 150B-44 timeline.

      <p>
       Waiver.
   
   - Forestry association that participated in hearings conducted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) to review an administrative law judge's (ALJ's) decision waived its claim that the EMC lost its power to review the ALJ's decision, by conducting the hearings beyond the time limits prescribed by G.S. 150B-44, when it failed to make its claim to the EMC.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       De Novo Review Proper.
   
   - Trial court properly applied the substantial evidence test in reviewing an administrative law judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law; the trial court also properly employed a de novo review of the question of the application of G.S. 150B-44. Teague v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 628 S.E.2d 395 (2006), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 373</cite>, 662 S.E.2d 395 (2008), cert. dismissed, mandamus dism'd, - N.C.

     Some of the cases below were decided under corresponding provisions of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>, or under this Chapter prior to the 1991 amendments thereto.

      <p>
       Application of Section.
   
   - Where the complaints and notices of hearing were filed prior to Jan. 1, 1986, the action was commenced prior to Jan. 1, 1986, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> had no application in the case; thus, G.S. 150A-45 (rewritten and recodified as this section), requiring a person seeking review to file a petition in the Superior Court of Wake County, and not this section, permitting such filing in either Wake County or the county where the person resides, governed. Pinewood Manor Mobile Homes, Inc. v. North Carolina Manufactured Hous. Bd., <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 564, 353 S.E.2d 231, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 674</cite>, 356 S.E.2d 780 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Procedures and requirements of the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act, G.S. 150B-1 et seq., were not to be incorporated into the statutory requirements under G.S. 53-92(d) for an appeal from a final decision of the North Carolina State Banking Commission. In re Advance Am., Cash Advance Ctrs. of N.C. Inc., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 657 S.E.2d 405 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to dismiss, for a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, a claim by state foresters against the State for overtime compensation for time spent fighting forest fires because G.S. 143-300.35(a) authorized the maintenance of a separate action in the trial division of the general courts of justice for claims brought by state employees against state agencies under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.S.
   <span class="s1">

   </span>
   201 et seq., without exhausting administrative remedies pursuant to G.S. 126-34.1(a)(11)(a) (now repealed). Brown v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 714 S.E.2d 154 (2011), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 570</cite>, 724 S.E.2d 525, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 270 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction Properly Asserted.
   
   - Trial court properly asserted jurisdiction over a county board of education because the board submitted to the jurisdiction of the trial court and waived its personal jurisdiction defense when it failed to raise the issue of jurisdiction at the hearing and argued the merits of the case. Tobe-Williams v. New Hanover County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 759 S.E.2d 680 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was properly denied as a petition challenging its NPDES permit was timely filed under G.S. 150B-45, and there was no challenge to the good cause shown to extend the time for service. Sound Rivers, Inc. v. N.C. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, Div. of Water Res., - N.C. App.
   - , 845 S.E.2d 802 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Good Cause Shown.
   
   - Superior court's conclusion that there was good cause shown to accept applicant's untimely new petition did not demonstrate a clear abuse of discretion because the superior court found that the applicants were diligent in its attempts to have the merits of the final agency decision litigated and decided, there was little material harm to the agency from any delay in having the petition untimely filed, and the applicants would suffer a grave injustice by being unable to prosecute the action if the agency's motion to dismiss was granted. High Rock Lake Partners, LLC v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 442, 720 S.E.2d 706 (2011), dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 569</cite>, 724 S.E.2d 516, 2012 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes,
   
   judicial review of a final decision under that article is to be had in the Superior Court of Wake County or the superior court of the county where the person seeking review resides. Iredell Mem. Hosp. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 406 S.E.2d 304 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where declaratory ruling was not served on county in accordance with statute,
   
   county did not waive its right to seek judicial review by waiting more than 30 days after it received a copy of the decision to file its petition for review. In re Brunswick County, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 391, 344 S.E.2d 584 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Former G.S. 150A-45 (rewritten and recodified as this section) confers exclusive jurisdiction
   
   for judicial review of final agency decisions on the Superior Court of Wake County when a state rather than a local agency made the initial determination. State ex rel. Lee v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 284 S.E.2d 572 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Strict Construction of Waiver Provisions.
   
   - Statutory provisions providing for the waiver or forfeiture of the right to judicial review under certain conditions should be construed strictly; and, when so construed, the right to petition for review continues unless and until 30 days have expired from the date "a written copy" of the administrative order has been served on the party seeking review, either by personal service or by registered mail, return receipt requested. In re Appeal of Harris, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 20</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 539 (1968), decided prior to enactment of this Chapter.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No statutory authority exists for the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] to review an administrative law judge's recommended decision
   
   in a case involving an exempt employee. Johnson v. Natural Resources &amp; Community Dev., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 391 S.E.2d 48, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 140</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 176 (1990), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 689</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 469 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A petitioner seeking judicial review of a decision of the North Carolina Driver License Medical Review Board
   
   must file such petition in the Superior Court of Wake County pursuant to former G.S. 150A-45 (rewritten and recodified as this section), and may not obtain a hearing under G.S. 20-25 in the superior court of the county in which he resides. Cox v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 749, 217 S.E.2d 198 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of ABC Permit Constituting Action on "Issuance".
   
   - Where application for an ABC permit was initially denied by commission on Dec. 9, 1985, this denial was clearly a commission action on "issuance" of an ABC permit, and, pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 18B-906, the ruling on the application became a "contested case" for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act on Dec. 9, 1985. Therefore, former G.S. 150A-45 (rewritten and recodified as this section), which required petitions for review to be filed in Wake County, was applicable, rather than this section, and the trial court properly dismissed petition for judicial review, which had been filed in Craven County. In re Melkonian, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 355 S.E.2d 798, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 793</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 78 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Time for Filing Petition.
   
   - Owners of condemned land were required to file their petition within 30 days of publication of final environmental impact statement concerning proposed state highway. DOT v. Blue, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 596, 556 S.E.2d 609 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Petition for Review Untimely.
   
   - Employee's petition for judicial review of a school board's determination which upheld a superintendent's decision to terminate the employee was untimely because no other statute provided guidance for the judicial review of school board decisions, so the trial court properly looked to Article 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act to determine the correct time limit; under G.S. 150B-45(a), the time limit was 30 days, and the employee filed her petition nine months after the decision, well outside the 30-day limit. Coomer v. Lee County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 155, 723 S.E.2d 802 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The result of a petitioner's ineffective attempts to file a petition
   
   for a contested case hearing was only a contested case. Community Psychiatric Ctrs. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 405 S.E.2d 769 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the jurisdictional prerequisite of a contested case hearing,
   
   a petitioner cannot utilize G.S. 131E-188(b) to appeal to the Court of Appeals. Community Psychiatric Ctrs. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 405 S.E.2d 769 (1991).

       Purpose of Statute Necessitates Liberal Construction.
   
   - The primary purpose of the statute is to confer the right of review, and the statute should be liberally construed to preserve and effectuate that right. James v.

       Service of Petition for Judicial Review.
   
   - Service of a petition for judicial review upon the North Carolina State University's (NCSU) counsel did not comply with G.S. 150B-46 as the counsel was an employee of the North Carolina Department of Justice and a member of North Carolina's Attorney General's (AG) staff, not of NCSU; an employee's decision to effectuate service by certified mail via a private letter carrier did not render the service of the petition upon an agency's attorney of record under
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   150B-46 as the employee was aware of the physical street address of NCSU's process agent, and the fact that the AG's office only provided the employee with a post office box for the process agent did not render the service of the employee's petition in compliance with

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Petition Sufficient.
   
   - Trial court did not err by denying the State of North Carolina Board of Barber Examiners' motion to dismiss the owner's petition for judicial review because the petition was sufficiently explicit to allow effective judicial review. Kindsgrab v. State Bd. of Barber Examiners, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 564, 763 S.E.2d 913 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Extension of Time to Serve.
   
   - Trial court properly allowed the Highway Patrol to serve a sergeant properly, though outside the 10-day statutory window because the sergeant received a copy of the petition (though through regular mail) within 10 days of the filing of the petition, and once proper service was accomplished, the trial court obtained personal jurisdiction over the sergeant. NC Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Owens, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 782 S.E.2d 337 (2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction Properly Asserted.
   
   - Trial court properly asserted jurisdiction over a county board of education because the board submitted to the jurisdiction of the trial court and waived its personal jurisdiction defense when it failed to raise the issue of jurisdiction at the hearing and argued the merits of the case. Tobe-Williams v. New Hanover County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 759 S.E.2d 680 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Inadequacy of Administrative Remedies Insufficiently Alleged.
   
   - Employee bringing a breach of employment contract claim against North Carolina Central University (University) inadequately alleged inadequate administrative remedies because (1) the employee's damage claims did not meet this purpose, as the unavailability of damages under G.S. 150B-43 did not make the remedy inadequate, and (2) the fact that only remand to the University was available did not cause the employee's prediction that the University would again rule against the employee to show the remedy was inadequate. Frazier v. N.C. Cent. Univ., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 37, 779 S.E.2d 515 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Intervention Appropriate.
   
   - Trial court did not err in allowing other school boards to intervene in an action challenging the State Board of Education's inaction with respect to a virtual charter school application where the boards were faced with an imminent economic injury via loss of school funding based on the ruling of the administrative law judge, and the administrative law judge's decision could have had a significant impact on all school boards across the State, thus creating a present and substantial matter of concern for both the State Board of Education and the intervening school boards regarding issues of management, oversight, and regulation. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. N.C. Learns, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 270, 751 S.E.2d 625 (2013).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Comply with Essential Requirements.
   
   - Trial court properly dismissed a teacher's petition for judicial review in which he sought to challenge the termination of his employment by the county board of education because, given the lack of any statutory provision governing the contents and service of petitions for judicial review, it was appropriate to apply the APA, and the teacher's petition failed to comply with several essential requirements of the APA where his petition failed to state any specific exceptions to the board's decision or the relief he sought to obtain, he failed to serve the board with his petition within the 10-day time limit, and instead simply served a copy of his petition upon the attorney for the board.

       Former G.S. 150A-48 must be construed in pari materia with the rest of this Article,
   
   and particularly former G.S. 150A-43, which states that any person who is aggrieved by a final agency decision in a contested case, and who has exhausted all administrative remedies made available to him by statute or agency rule, is entitled to judicial review of such decision under Article 4 of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>.

       Former G.S. 150A-48 was meant to entitle the aggrieved person to a stay order only after the final agency decision
   
   and either before or after initiation of judicial review. Stevenson v. North Carolina Dep't of Ins., <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 229 S.E.2d 209 (1976); Davis v.

       Stay of Decision Unavailable Prior to "Final Agency Decision".
   
   - Former G.S. 150A-48 is a vehicle for reinstatement only "before or during the review proceeding." Since, according to former G.S. 150A-43, review is available only after a "final agency decision," the stay of a decision is similarly only available after a "final agency decision." Davis v.

       Judge Not Subject to Rule 52(a) Requirements.
   
   - When the judge of the superior court sits as an appellate court to review the decision of an administrative agency pursuant to former G.S. 150B-50 he is not required to make findings of fact and enter a judgment thereon in the same sense as is a trial judge pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 52(a). In re Arcadia Dairy Farms, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 259 S.E.2d 368 (1979), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 545</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 403 (1980).

       Appellate Review of Local Government Actions.
   
   - Although this section of the Act provides review only for agency decisions and local units of government are not within the definition of agencies in G.S. 150B-2(1), the principles embodied in the Act "are highly pertinent" to appellate review of local government actions. Vulcan Materials Co. v. Guilford County Bd. of County Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C.

       Standard on Review of City's Special Zoning Request Decisions.
   
   - Although the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act provides judicial review only for agency decisions and exempts cities and other local municipalities, a similar standard of review is appropriate to review city council special zoning request decisions. Jennewein v. City Council, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 302 S.E.2d 7, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 461</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 365 (1983).

      <p>
       Improper Dismissal of Judicial Review Petition.
   
   - Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) decision to uphold permits for the use of coal combustion residual as structural fill at open pit mines was reversed because: (1) the ALJ erred in sua sponte converting a motion for summary judgment into a motion for involuntary dismissal and granting the same, as the ALJ had no such authority, and (2) issues raised by environmental groups required distinctly different reviews of the evidence under the whole record standard and of issues of law under the de novo standard, but it was unclear what standards the trial court applied, as the court reweighed the evidence and rewrote the ALJ's decision without explanation.

        Unacceptable Personal Conduct by Employee.
   
   - Summary judgment for a state agency employer in an employee's petition for review of his demotion was proper where the conduct admitted by the employee constituted "unacceptable personal conduct," and the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] determined that its regulations and work rules did not contain any qualification or exception for the explanations asserted by the employee.

        In a case in which a tenured professor appealed a superior court's affirmation of the administrative decision to terminate him, he argued unsuccessfully that the superior court erred in holding that the record contained substantial evidence to support his discharge for incompetence. The professor relied on his argument that lack of collegiality could not constitute incompetence; however, he cited no authority that disruptive behavior could not constitute incompetence. Bernold v.

        Superior Court Review of Agency Decision.
   
   - In its role as an appellate court, the superior court reviews the agency's decision, but is not allowed to replace the agency's judgment with its own when there are two reasonably conflicting views, even though the court could have reached a different result upon de novo review. Rector v. North Carolina Sheriffs' Educ. &amp; Training Stds. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 406 S.E.2d 613 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly applied the substantial evidence test in reviewing an administrative law judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law; the trial court also properly employed a de novo review of the question of the application of G.S. 150B-44. Teague v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's finding that it was permitted to give appropriate weight to an agency's demonstrated expertise and consistency in applying various statutes was proper because, under G.S. 150B-51(c), the agency's consistently applied interpretation of the law should have been accorded the same deference it was entitled to under prior law. Rainey v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Instruction, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 679</cite>, 652 S.E.2d 251 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a superior court, as part of its de novo review under G.S. 150B-51(c) of a state board of education decision to deny petitioner a salary increase under G.S. 115C-296.2(b), was entitled to defer to the board's expertise, petitioner was entitled to the salary increase on the merits. Rainey v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Instruction, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 667 S.E.2d 237 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 130</cite>, 673 S.E.2d 361 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consistent with G.S. 150B-51(c) of the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act, G.S. 150B-1 through 150B-52, a trial court is permitted to make its own findings of fact, even though neither party objected to the findings of the agency. Meza v. Div. of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 668 S.E.2d 571 (2008), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 61</cite>, 692 S.E.2d 96 N.C. LEXIS 343 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in reversing an administrative law judge's decision that a corporation's decertification as a provider of HIV case management services by the AIDS Care Unit at respondent North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, (DHHS) was unjustified because the trial court properly applied the standard of review from G.S. 150B-51(c), and substantial evidence supported the trial court's findings of fact that the violations found at the corporation were systemic, and DHHS was justified in not allowing corrective action. Bradley-Reid Corp. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 689 S.E.2d 494 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reviewing court properly conducted a de novo review of the record and made independent findings as required by G.S. 150B-51(c), even though it adopted an administrative law judge's findings, as it stated that it had given no deference to any prior decision in the case, and had reviewed and considered the official record de novo. McCrann v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 704 S.E.2d 899, review denied <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 198</cite>, 710 S.E.2d 23, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 436 (2011).

        Trial court erred in reversing the North Carolina Highway Patrol's decision to terminate a sergeant's employment because the trial court did not make adequate findings of fact, in accordance with G.S. 150B-51(c), and there was a conflict between the administrative law judge's findings of fact, which stated the Patrol failed to establish the sergeant drove a Patrol vehicle with any alcohol in his system, and the trial court's findings of fact, which stated the sergeant consumed some amount of alcohol prior to driving; the dismissal was based on the Patrol's determination that the sergeant had engaged in unacceptable personal conduct.

        Trial court applied the proper standard of review when it affirmed the North Carolina Department of State Treasurer's decision to deny a corporation's request for a declaratory ruling and dismissing its petition for judicial review because the trial court properly applied a de novo standard of review to the issue of whether the reasons given by the State Treasurer constituted good cause to decline to issue a ruling.

        Scope of Appellate Review.
   
   - In an action arising from allegations of age discrimination, while the superior court properly applied both a de novo review and the whole-record test to the respective issues on appeal under G.S. 150B-51(b) when it reviewed the final decision of the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] (SPC), it erred when it improperly substituted its judgment for that of the SPC under the whole-record test. Thus, remand was ordered for the superior court to affirm the SPC's final agency decision. Trotter v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 659 S.E.2d 749 (2008).

        Review of Agency Decisions.
   
   - Under G.S. 150B-36(b), a final agency decision in a contested case hearing must be based on the official record prepared pursuant to G.S. 150B-37l; the agency is not permitted to hear new evidence, and if it does so, the trial court on review is required to reverse or remand the agency decision. Everhart &amp; Assocs. v. Department of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 493 S.E.2d 66 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 575</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 590 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to G.S. 150B-51(b), in reviewing a final agency decision, a court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand a case for further proceedings. It may also reverse or modify the agency's decision if substantial rights of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because the agency's findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) in violation of constitutional provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by other error of law; (5) unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted; or (6) arbitrary or capricious, or an abuse of discretion.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a petitioner contends an agency's decision was based on an error of law, de novo review by the trial court is proper; in turn, an appellate court examines a trial court's order regarding an agency decision for errors of law.

       <p>
        In reviewing the imposition of a five-year suspension by a state police officer certification agency, a trial court erroneously applied the standard under G.S. 150B-51(b) because the agency's decision had been a summary judgment ruling, which under G.S. 150B-51(d) required application of the summary judgment standard, and the officer's evidence raised genuine issues of material fact regarding the claims concerning his suspension. Krueger v. N.C. Crim. Justice Educ. &amp; Training Stds. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 569, 680 S.E.2d 216 (2009).

        Trial court failed to apply the correct standard of review in reviewing the decision of the Tax Review Board, which overruled the final decision of the Assistant Secretary of Review that a taxpayer's business was ineligible for credits under the William S. Lee Quality Jobs and Expansion Act because the trial court's findings of fact ranged far beyond the findings made by the Assistant Secretary and addressed new information that did not appear to have provided any part of the basis for the Assistant Secretary's decision; the additional findings of fact made by the trial court had a definite effect on the trial court's decision.

        State hearing officer did not explain with any degree of specificity the processes used to conclude that the claimant was able to engage in light work; the decision lacked the detailed analysis necessary for meaningful appellate review, and on remand the agency was to provide a narrative discussion of whether the claimant's limitations would prevent her from performing the full range of light work.

        Administrative law judge properly approved the issuance of a certificate of need by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Healthcare Planning and Certificate of Need Section, because substantial evidence supported the finding that the application conformed with statutory criteria regarding the host site requirement and the reasonableness and adequacy of the applicant's projections. Furthermore, a purported rescission letter by a host site was not an amendment to the application. Mobile Imaging Partners of N.C. LLC v. N.C. HHS, - N.C. App.

        Nature of Error Dictates Manner of Review.
   
   - The nature of the error asserted by the party seeking review dictates the appropriate manner of review, so that if the appellant contends the agency's decision was affected by a legal error, de novo review is required, whereas if he contends the decision was not supported by the evidence or was arbitrary or capricious the whole record test is used.

       <p>
        Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) decision to uphold permits for the use of coal combustion residual as structural fill at open pit mines was reversed because: (1) the ALJ erred in sua sponte converting a motion for summary judgment into a motion for involuntary dismissal and granting the same, as the ALJ had no such authority, and (2) issues raised by environmental groups required distinctly different reviews of the evidence under the whole record standard and of issues of law under the de novo standard, but it was unclear what standards the trial court applied, as the court reweighed the evidence and rewrote the ALJ's decision without explanation.

        Affected by Error of Law.
   
   - Petitioner was dismissed from the North Carolina State Highway Patrol for alleged violations of the Patrol's truthfulness policy, but because the colonel did not understand that he had discretion to consider the full range of potential discipline, his decision was affected by an error of law; under the flexible definition of just cause, the colonel had discretion in dismissing an employee for violating the policy, and while dismissal may be reasonable for dishonest conduct, the better practice would be to allow for a range of disciplinary actions in response to an individual act of untruthfulness, rather than a categorical approach.

        Constitutional Review Not Contemplated Absent Assertion of Constitutional Violations.
   
   - Former G.S. 58-9.6(b)(1) (now G.S. 58-2-90(b)(1)) and subdivision (1) of former G.S. 150A-51 do not contemplate constitutional review where appellants, rate bureau and member companies, made no assertion that their rights were prejudiced because any of the findings or conclusions of the Commissioner of Insurance were in violation of any constitutional provisions.

        The superior court misperceived the proper scope of its review where the record nowhere demonstrated petitioners raised any constitutional issues in a manner requiring the superior court to pass on the constitutional validity of any assessment under G.S. 113A-64.

        Official Acts Presumed to Be Made Lawfully and in Good Faith.
   
   - The members of the State Board of Assessment (now the Property Tax Commission) are public officers, and the Board's official acts are presumed to be made in good faith and in accordance with law; the burden is upon the party asserting otherwise to overcome such presumptions by competent evidence to the contrary. Albemarle Elec. Membership Corp. v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 402</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 811 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a rebuttable presumption that an administrative agency has properly performed its official duties, and while arbitrary and capricious agency action is itself prohibited by federal and state due process, any assertion of arbitrary agency action does not necessarily require the agency's action be reviewed for compliance with every other requirement under the state and federal Constitutions.

        In an action regarding the termination of state employment,
   
   G.S. 150B-51(b) authorized the trial court to reverse or modify an administrative agency's decision dismissing the employee's appeal if her substantial rights may have been prejudiced, because the agency's decision was (1) in violation of constitutional provisions, (2) in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency, (3) made upon unlawful procedure, (4) affected by other error of law, (5) unsupported by substantial evidence admissible under G.S. 150B-29(a), 150B-30, or 150B-21 in view of the entire record as submitted, or (6) arbitrary or capricious.

        Authority of Judge on Review.

        Under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite>, a reviewing court's power to affirm the decision of the agency and to remand for further proceedings is not circumscribed.

        Final sentence of G.S. 150B-34(c) exempts certificate of need proceedings from the newly amended portions of G.S. 150B-51 and requires an appellate court to review those decisions under the previous version of G.S. 150B-51.

        Trial Court Applied Correct Standard of Review.
   
   - Trial court's judgment reversing a decision of the state personnel commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] was affirmed where the trial court applied the correct standard of review in determining that a state employee had not been demoted for just cause.

        Statement of Mandatory Standard of Review Not Required.
   
   - Although an agency contended that a trial court's failure to state the standard of review which the trial court applied to its review of an agency decision precluded meaningful appellate review, the agency decision rejected an administrative law judge's decision and thus, under G.S. 150B-51(c), de novo review was mandatory and the trial court was not required to state the standard.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Review of Statutory Interpretation.
   
   - As incorrect statutory interpretation by an agency constitutes an error of law under subdivision (b)(4), when the issue on appeal is whether the state agency erred in interpreting a statutory term, an appellate court may substitute its own judgment for that of the agency and employ de novo review. Friends of Hatteras Island Nat'l Historic Maritime Forest Land Trust for Preservation, Inc. v. Coastal Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 556, 452 S.E.2d 337 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the interpretation of the Department of Health and Human Services of similar proposals within the same service area was reasonable, and a permissible construction of the statute, the court of appeals was required to defer to it.

        This Section Distinguished from Review Pursuant to G.S.
   
   150B-52. - When an appellate court reviews the decision of a lower court (as opposed to when it reviews an administrative agency's decision on direct appeal), the scope of review to be applied under G.S. 150B-52 is the same as it is for other civil cases.

        Application in Insurance Ratemaking Cases.
   
   - While former G.S. 150A-51 is the controlling judicial review statute in insurance ratemaking cases, to the extent that former G.S. 58-9.6(b) (now G.S. 58-2-90(b)) adds to the judicial review function, and in light of the virtually identical thrust of the two statutes, the Supreme Court would apply the review standards of both former G.S. 58-9.6 (now G.S. 58-2-90) and former G.S. 150A-51, where such standards could be construed as being consistent with each other.

        Since the scope of review provided in Article 4 of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite> is substantially broader than that provided by former G.S. 58-9.3 (now G.S. 58-2-75), the scope of judicial review applicable to a denial by the Commissioner of Insurance of a plan by a domestic insurance company to reorganize under a holding company structure was that provided for in Article 4.

   - While former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite> controls judicial review of insurance ratemaking procedures, the review provisions of former G.S. 58-9 through 58-27 (now G.S. 58-2-40 through 58-2-200) should also apply insofar as those provisions are compatible with the act.

   58-2-75. - Although G.S. 58-2-75 and this section are comparable, this section is the controlling judicial review statute; however, to the extent that G.S. 58-2-75 added to and was consistent with the judicial review function of this section, the court would apply the review standards articulated in both statutes.

   - When the issue on appeal is whether a state agency erred in interpreting a statutory term, an appellate court may freely substitute its judgment for that of the agency and employ de novo review. Brooks v. Rebarco, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 372 S.E.2d 342 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the interpretation of a statute by an agency created to administer that statute is traditionally accorded some deference by appellate courts, those interpretations are not binding. Bashford v. North Carolina Licensing Bd., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 420 S.E.2d 466 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a petitioner alleges that an agency violated his constitutional rights, the Supreme Court will undertake de novo review. Meads v. North Carolina Dep't of Agric., <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 656</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 165 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because appellees alleged in their petition for judicial review that appellants erroneously construed State and federal law regarding the relation between Medicare and Medicaid, the court would review the matter de novo and was free to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. Duke Univ. Medical Ctr. v. Bruton, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 516 S.E.2d 633 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior Court properly exercised de novo review in examining the substantive issues raised by an appeal of the superior court's reversal of a final agency decision. County of Wake v. N.C. Dep't of Env't, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 225, 573 S.E.2d 572 (2002), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 62</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 387 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only in contested cases commenced on or after 1 January 2001, where the agency fails to adopt the ALJ's initial decision, does G.S. 150B-51(c) require a reviewing court to engage in independent fact-finding; otherwise, where the findings of fact of an administrative agency are supported by substantial competent evidence in view of the entire record, they are binding on a reviewing court, and the reviewing court lacks authority on de novo review to make alternative findings at variance with the agency's decision. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res. v. Carroll, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 649</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 888 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judicial review of a North Carolina Psychology Board decision to place a psychological associate's license on probation, under G.S. 90-270.4(g), was de novo as the case concerned the Psychology Board's authority under G.S. 90-270.4(g); further, the psychological assistant, who maintained both a licensed psychological associate's practice and a licensed professional counselor's practice, could continue his licensed professional counselor's practice without interference from the Psychology Board pursuant to G.S. 90-332.1(c) as long as he remained a qualified licensed professional counselor and did not promote that practice by holding himself out as a licensed psychological associate. Trayford v. N.C. Psychology Bd., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 619 S.E.2d 862 (2005), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 396</cite>, 627 S.E.2d 462 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        De Novo Review Permits New Findings of Fact.
   
   - Under G.S. 150B-51(c), a trial court is permitted to make its own findings of fact, even though neither party objects to the administrative findings. Cape Med. Transp., Inc. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 14, 590 S.E.2d 8 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, as recodified in 1985, and prior to its amendment in 1987, did not require the reviewing court to set out its reasons
   
   for reversal or modification, unlike under former G.S. 150A-51, which required the reviewing court to set out written reasons only when reversing or modifying an agency decision. Shepherd v. Consolidated Judicial Retirement Sys., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 560, 366 S.E.2d 604 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate Court Review Not Limited to Superior Court's Findings and Conclusions.
   
   - Appellate court's review is limited to assignments of error to the superior court's order, but is not required to accord any particular deference to the superior court's findings and conclusions concerning the Commission's actions. Watson v. North Carolina Real Estate Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 362 S.E.2d 294 (1987), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 746</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 296 (1988).

        Court of Appeals merely determines whether an administrative decision has a rational basis in the evidence.
   
   North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 394 S.E.2d 285 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasons for Not Adopting Recommendations.
   
   - Subsection (a) did not entitle petitioner to a review of whether the specific reasons the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] did not adopt the recommended decision were correct; only that they be stated. Oates v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 597, 442 S.E.2d 542 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Review by Court of Appeals.
   
   - Court of Appeal's review of trial court's consideration of final agency decision is to determine whether trial court failed to properly apply review standard articulated in this section.
   Review is further limited to exceptions and assignments of error set forth to order of superior court. Walker v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 397 S.E.2d 350 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 98</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 430 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, review by Court of Appeals is limited by properly presented assignments of error and exceptions. North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 394 S.E.2d 285 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The scope of review applied by an appellate court when reviewing a decision of a lower court is the same as in other civil cases. Thus, the appellate court's review is limited to determining whether the superior court committed any errors of law. Crowell Constructors, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 716, 421 S.E.2d 612 (1992), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 343</cite>, 426 S.E.2d 704 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard of review for an appellate court upon an appeal from an order of the superior court affirming or reversing an administrative agency decision is the same standard of review as that employed by the superior court. Dorsey v. UNC-Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 468 S.E.2d 557 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court remanded the trial court's judgment that the Director of the North Carolina Division of Water Quality acted lawfully when he excluded certain wood chip mills from coverage under a storm water general permit because the record did not show that the trial court applied the proper standard of review. N.C. Forestry Ass'n v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 591 S.E.2d 549 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Standards of Review Contrasted.
   
   - Proper standard to be applied on appeal depends on the issues presented.
   If it is alleged that the agency's decision was based on an error of law, then de novo review is required. Review of whether an agency decision is supported by evidence, or is arbitrary or capricious, requires the court to employ the whole record test. Walker v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 397 S.E.2d 350 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 98</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 430 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inadequate Notice.
   
   - Agency decision dismissing a state employee was reversed where the reviewing court found that notice given to the employee did not provide her with adequate notice of the reasons for her dismissal. Owen v. UNC-G Physical Plant, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 682, 468 S.E.2d 813, discretionary review improvidently allowed, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 73</cite>, 477 S.E.2d 33 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Procedural safeguards within G.S. 126-35(a) serve as a prophylactic protection against summary dismissal of state employees based on inadequate notice. Owen v. UNC-G Physical Plant, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 682, 468 S.E.2d 813, discretionary review improvidently allowed, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 73</cite>, 477 S.E.2d 33 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute does not require a point-by-point refutation
   
   of the Administrative Law Judge's findings and conclusions. Webb v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, Coastal Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 767, 404 S.E.2d 29 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the commission's findings discussed the flawed premises of the recommended decision
   
   of the Administrative Law Judge, those findings were adequate, quite specific indeed, and went to the heart of the case. Webb v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, Coastal Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 767, 404 S.E.2d 29 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Remand Required for Insufficiency of Findings Under Former G.S. 150A-36.
   
   - Where, on review of an order of a state commission permitting petitioner savings and loan association to open a branch office, the trial court determined that the commission's findings were insufficient in that they lacked the specificity required by former G.S. 150A-36, the trial court should never have reached the question of whether reversal under subdivision (5) of former G.S. 150A-51 was appropriate, as remand for further findings was essential upon concluding that the findings of record presented an inadequate basis for review. Under no applicable theory of law would it be appropriate for the trial court to reverse the commission and substitute its judgment for the commission's. Community Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. North Carolina Sav. &amp; Loan Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 259 S.E.2d 373 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings of Fact Binding Where Respondent Failed to Object.
   
   - Respondent did not object to adopted findings of fact at superior court level.
   Findings of fact were binding, therefore, at that appellate level, and binding for purposes of review by the Court of Appeals. Walker v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 397 S.E.2d 350 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 98</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 430 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Review of Decisions of Boards of Education.
   
   - The appropriate standard of judicial review for reviewing administrative decisions of boards of education is set forth in former G.S. 150A-51. Faulkner v. New Bern-Craven County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 309 S.E.2d 548 (1983), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 42</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 281 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a school superintendent recommended to a school board that a probationary teacher's contract, which had expired, not be renewed, and the board adopted that recommendation, a court could reverse or modify that decision only if the teacher's substantial rights might have been prejudiced because the board's findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions were: (1) in violation of constitutional provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by other error of law; (5) unsupported by substantial evidence admissible under G.S. 150B-29(a), G.S. 150B-30, or G.S. 150B-31 in view of the entire record as submitted; or (6) arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion because judicial review of that decision was governed by G.S. 150B-51. Moore v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 649 S.E.2d 410 (2007), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 360</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 735 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicable standard of judicial review for an appeal of a school board decision
   
   is set forth in former G.S. 150A-51. Goodwin v. Goldsboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 312 S.E.2d 892, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 304</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 680 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standards for judicial review set forth in former G.S. 150A-51 are applicable to appeals from school boards to the courts, since no other statute provides guidance for judicial review of school board decisions and in the interest of uniformity in reviewing administrative board decisions. Faulkner v. New Bern-Craven County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 42</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 281 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        While G.S. 150B-2(1) expressly excepts local boards of education from the coverage of the Administrative Procedure Act, nonetheless the standards for judicial review set forth in this section apply to appeals from school boards. Evers v. Pender County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 407 S.E.2d 879 (1991), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 380</cite>, 416 S.E.2d 3 (1992).

        Appeal to Superior Court.
   
   - A teacher who is denied a promotion under the career ladder program may appeal to the superior court after exhausting his administrative remedies by appealing to the local board of education. Warren v. New Hanover County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 410 S.E.2d 232 (1991).

       <p>
        Basis for Review of Personnel Commission Decision.
   
   - While respondent's and petitioner's motions for summary judgment in superior court on review of State Personnel Commission's [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] decision were procedurally incorrect, the trial court's order allowing respondent's motion for summary judgment was tantamount to affirming the full Commission's ruling, and sufficiently set forth a reviewable basis for affirming such ruling. Parks v. Department of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 338 S.E.2d 826, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 553</cite>, 344 S.E.2d 8, 345 S.E.2d 383 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Review of Discrimination Cases.
   
   - In a discrimination case, the appellate court reviews the ALJ's opinion, as adopted without alteration by the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission], the local appointing authority, and trial court, for errors of law, violations of constitutional provisions, and whether the decision was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion; all other errors are deemed abandoned. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 595 S.E.2d 744 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the Office of Administrative Hearings had jurisdiction to hear an African-American employee's contested case of racial discrimination, the employee met his prima facie burden of discrimination, the trial court applied the appropriate standard of review, and the employee presented sufficient evidence of unequal treatment of an African-American employee compared to a Caucasian employee, and established that the Hatch Act was a pretext for discrimination, a finding of discrimination by an administrative law judge was upheld. Corbett v. N.C. DMV, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 660 S.E.2d 233 (2008), review dismissed, as moot, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 124</cite>, 675 S.E.2d 40, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 124</cite>, 675 S.E.2d 41 (2009).

       <p>
        Review of Award of Industrial Commission.
   
   - In passing upon an appeal from an award of the Industrial Commission, the reviewing court is limited in its inquiry to two questions of law, namely: (1) Whether or not there was any competent evidence before the Commission to support its findings of fact; and (2) Whether or not the findings of fact of the Commission justified its legal conclusions and decision. Waggoner v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 692, 173 S.E.2d 548 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Cancellation of Truck Driver School License.
   
   - Superior court had jurisdiction pursuant to this section to review order cancelling petitioner's truck driver school license, even though petitioner waived its right to an evidentiary hearing. Charlotte Truck Driver Training School, Inc. v. North Carolina DMV, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 381 S.E.2d 861 (1989).

       <p>
        Rescission of Coastal Area Management Act Development Permit.
   
   - Trial court's rescission of Coastal Area Management Act Development permit was affirmed where there were a variety of ecological concerns, potential environmental damage, and interference with public access to and use of the affected waters, and the whole record showed that the only basis for issuing the permit was that it would make the public waters adjacent to the permittee's condominium project more convenient for the permittee's use. Ballance v. North Carolina Coastal Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 288, 423 S.E.2d 815 (1992), petition for reconsideration dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 789</cite>, 431 S.E.2d 21 (1993).

        Determining Unnecessary Hardship from Coastal Area Management Act.
   
   - To determine whether a parcel of property suffers from unnecessary hardship due to strict application of the Coastal Area Management Act, the Coastal Resources Commission must make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the impact of the Act on the landowner's ability to make reasonable use of his property. Williams v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., Div. of Coastal Mgmt., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 548 S.E.2d 793 (2001).

       <p>
        Superior court is without power to order the North Carolina Board of Alcoholic Control to issue a permit
   
   to petitioners, but can order the Board to exercise its discretion in accordance with law. Waggoner v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 692, 173 S.E.2d 548 (1970).

        Evidence held incompetent to sustain a finding of the State Board of Alcoholic Control
   
   that a licensee sold beer to a minor or failed to give his licensed premises proper supervision. Thomas v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 513</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 884 (1963).

        Safety training violation by contractor was considered "serious"
   
   where the evidence showed that (1) the lack of proper training created the possibility of an accident, and (2) if an accident did occur, there was a substantial probability of death or serious physical harm. Associated Mechanical Contractors v. Payne, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 825</cite>, 467 S.E.2d 398 (1996).
   <br />

       <p>
        Statement of Reasons for Reversing Decision Held Adequate.
   
   - Statement of superior court judge in reversing Hearing Aid Dealers and Fitters Board's conclusions that the facts found by the agency failed "to support its conclusion of law that the petitioner was grossly incompetent within the purview of G.S. 93D-13(a)(2)" constituted a succinct and adequate statement of its reasons for reversing the agency's decision. Faulkner v. North Carolina State Hearing Aid Dealers &amp; Fitters Bd., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 222, 247 S.E.2d 668 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence Supported Conclusion State Funds Had Been Misused.
   
   - Where petitioner had charged a number of personal calls to the State Telephone Network credit card he had been issued, there was substantial evidence before the commission to support its conclusion that petitioner had willfully and repeatedly misused State funds. White v. North Carolina Dep't of Envtl., Health, &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 451 S.E.2d 376 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Error of Law.
   
   - An error of law, as that term is used in subdivision (b)(4), exists if a conclusion of law entered by the administrative agency is not supported by the findings of fact entered by the agency or if the conclusion of law does not support the decision of the agency. Brooks v. Ansco &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 711, 443 S.E.2d 89 (1994).

        Termination After Refusing Improper Drug Testing Held Error.
   
   - Public employees met their burden of showing their employer did not have reasonable cause to ask them to submit to drug testing, and they could not be terminated for refusing to submit to testing, because they could not be required to waive a constitutionally protected right, and their termination was affected by error of law, under G.S. 150B-51(b)(4).

        Expert Testimony.
   
   - Three was no abuse of discretion by an administrative law judge in admitting the testimony of an applicant's expert witness, G.S. 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 702(a), because the witness, who prepared a blast evaluation for the applicant, was qualified in the study of ground vibration and its effect on structures and the fact the witness was neither a licensed engineer nor a licensed geologist did not render his expert testimony either "illegal" or inadmissible; the applicant, who held a mining permit, was allowed to add 37 acres to its previously permitted acreage and, within the proposed permit boundary, to increase the area disturbed by its mining operations by 22.1 acres.

       <p>
        A trial court and the Court of Appeals improperly engaged in independent fact-finding on de novo review
   
   by reversing the State Personnel Commission's [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] decision to adopt an ALJ's findings of fact that the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources lacked just cause to demote a park ranger and to order that the ranger be reinstated; the courts had no authority to determine that such just cause did in fact exist. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res. v. Carroll, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 649</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 888 (2004).

       <p>
        Remand Not Required Following Lower Court's Application of Improper Standard of Review.
   
   - Erroneous application of the de novo standard of review by both a trial court and the Court of Appeals, where those reviewing courts engaged in improper independent fact-finding, did not require a remand since the Supreme Court of North Carolina could reasonably determine from the record how the de novo standard should have been applied and whether the party challenging the agency's decision was entitled to a reversal or modification of that decision under the applicable provisions of G.S. 150B-51(b). N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res. v. Carroll, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 649</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 888 (2004).

        Substantial evidence in the record supported an administrative law judge's findings
   
   and its dismissal of a day care's petition for a contested case hearing where the day care filed nothing in nearly six months following the filing of the petition, despite receiving several orders from the administrative law judge to file and serve prehearing statements and other responses to motions; there was no requirement that the final decision be served personally or by certified mail, and in any event, the day care did not deny receiving a copy of the final decision and its substantial rights were not prejudiced in any way. Lincoln v. N.C. HHS, Nutrition Branch, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 616 S.E.2d 622 (2005).

       <p>
        While an expert testified that a highway patrol officer's use of alcohol was a factor in his behavior, which included firing his firearm into the floor and ingesting sleeping pills, the expert also testified that the officer's behavior was caused by a combination of alcohol, the officer's first dose of lithium, "hypomania," and his being "relatively unmedicated for his bipolar disorder;" accordingly, the challenged finding of fact was supported by substantial evidence. Neither could the court conclude that the application of the rational nexus test resulted in prejudice to the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety; thus, the Department did not have just cause to dismiss the officer. Bulloch v. N.C. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 732 S.E.2d 373 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrative law judge did not commit legal error in finding no just cause for a state employee's suspension because the employee had eight years of positive employment history, and other employees were able to cover the hour she was late one day, resulting in no negative impact to the operation of a development center or the care of its residents; pursuant to the center's policy, the employee was never "absent" from work but merely tardy. Peterson v. Caswell Developmental Ctr., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 628, 814 S.E.2d 590 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrative law judge (ALJ) acted within her authority by determining the center failed to meet its burden to show just cause existed to warrant a state employee's suspension for unacceptable personal conduct because the ALJ examined all the facts, circumstances, and equities present in the case, and the imposed written warning was within the authorized disciplinary alternatives.

        Remand Not Required After Standard of Review Not Stated.
   
   - Where an appellate court was able to review whether or not a decision by the board of education regarding a long-term suspension should have been upheld, it was not reversible error where the trial court failed to specify the standard of review utilized. Alexander v. Cumberland County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 615 S.E.2d 408 (2005).

       <p>
        Remand Required Following Lower Court's Application of Improper Standard of Review.
   
   - Under G.S. 150B-51(c), where an agency did not adopt an administrative law judge's decision, the reviewing court was required to review the official record, de novo, and make findings of fact and conclusions of law; a case was remanded where, in an officer disciplinary case where the state personnel commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] rejected the decision of an administrative law judge who had ruled that the officer be reinstated, the trial court applied whole record test and did not make findings of fact or conclusion of law.

        Appellate court found that the superior court, which initially reviewed a decision of the Board of Pharmacy reprimanding a permitee pharmacy chain for negligent acts of its licensed pharmacists, had not erred in finding no arbitrary or capricious action by the Board in choosing a sanction; case law already made it clear that the chain could be vicariously responsible for the pharmacists' actions, and so any sanction listed as applicable to a pharmacist could also be applied against the chain.

       <p>
        The trial court properly applied the whole record test, where it found that the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Environmental Management Commission did not exceed their discretion and authority under G.S. 143-211(c), 143-215.107(a)(1), (3), and G.S. 143-215.114A(a)(1) in finding that the contractor had open burning piles within 1,000 feet from a dwelling.

       <p>
        Competitor showed no error in the administrative law judge granting summary judgment for a certificate of need applicant's application because: (1) the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (Agency) did not wrongly consider only the project's county, under G.S. 131E-183(a)(3), (3a), (4), and (6), as the statute stated no geographical scope, and the Agency used an established practice of applying the Administrative Code to fill this gap, so the Agency did not unreasonably interpret the statute, (2) the Agency's incorporation by reference of findings regarding multiple criteria did not fail to independently review each criterion, and (3) the applicant adequately identified a funding source.

       <p>
        Assessment Based upon Penalty Factors Reasonably Related to Act's Enforcement.
   
   - Department's assessment was not based upon the secretary's "absolute" discretion, but instead upon numerous penalty factors reasonably related to the act's administration and enforcement, which resulted in a fair and reasoned penalty assessment.

       </p>
       <p>
        Exceeding Authority Did Not Prejudice Competitor.
   
   - While the Department of Health and Human Services technically exceeded its authority and jurisdiction and committed errors of law by awarding a certificate of need to establish a new dialysis center on the basis of an application that was never shown to be conforming to all applicable criteria, its actions did not prejudice the applicant's competitor because the alleged mistakes and omissions, made under a settlement agreement, were corrected by final agency decision.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial Prejudice.
   
   - When providers contested an agency's decision to let a competitor move specialty operating rooms to the providers' area, the agency's alleged failure to follow the agency's rules did not establish the providers' substantial prejudice as a matter of law because the providers also had to show the agency deprived the providers of property, ordered the providers to pay a fine or penalty, or otherwise substantially prejudiced the providers' rights.

        Competitor showed no error in the administrative law judge granting summary judgment for a certificate of need applicant's application because the competitor did not meet the competitor's burden to show substantial prejudice from granting the application, as (1) the proposed project added no new beds, services, or equipment, and (2) any harm from normal competition was not substantial prejudice.

        Failure of Agency to Make Required Findings.
   
   - Trial court did not have the authority to find, contrary to an agency conclusion, that a university research scientist was subjected to impermissible employment-related retaliation because of her protected activities; the agency failed to make the required factual findings, and therefore the case should have been remanded.

        Case was remanded because the final decision did not indicate that the conduct of a technician who worked for a county department of social services amounted to unacceptable personal conduct, and no conclusion of law asserted the department had substantive just cause for any disciplinary action; the ALJ had to make findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding whether the conduct was unacceptable personal conduct, and whether it amounted to just cause for the disciplinary action taken.

        Sufficiency of Due Process.
   
   - In a case in which a tenured professor appealed a superior court's affirmation of the administrative decision to terminate him, he argued unsuccessfully that the superior court committed reversible error in upholding his discharge on grounds of lack of collegiality, which was a substantive due process claim. The professor was terminated because his interactions with colleagues had been so disruptive that the effective and efficient operation of his department was impaired, and he was aware that collegiality was a professional expectation for his position and that his collegiality or lack thereof was one possible focus of evaluation during his post-tenure reviews; the University of North Carolina College of Engineering Regulation 05.67.04 stated that each faculty member was expected to work in a collegial manner.

        In a case in which a tenured professor appealed a superior court's affirmation of the administrative decision to terminate him, he argued unsuccessfully that the superior court committed reversible error in failing to find that his discharge violated his right to procedural due process. Specifically, he contended that the University of North Carolina's Board of Governors failed to provide him a clear plan and timetable for addressing his deficiencies, thus violating his procedural due process; however, while Section 603 of the Code of the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina specified the due process protections to which a tenured faculty member was entitled and contained a detailed schedule of steps involving notice and hearings which the university had to take prior to discharging a tenured faculty member, it did not contain any requirement for the tenured faculty member to be provided with a clear plan and timetable.

   - School board's policy which allowed a student facing long-term suspension to have an adult who was not a parent with him at a hearing on that suspension, but prevented the adult from being an attorney, or from questioning witnesses, making a statement, or otherwise representing the student, violated the student's substantial due process rights regarding his protected property interest in obtaining an education, and reversal of such suspension was required under G.S. 150B-51(b).

        Whole Record Test Retained.
   
   - Although the 1985 amendment of former G.S. 150A-51 deleted the phrase "in view of the entire record as submitted," the amendment maintained the whole record test for judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. In re K-mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 378</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 468 (1987), decided prior to 1987 amendment which reinserted the phrase "in view of the entire record as submitted"; Bashford v. North Carolina Licensing Bd., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 420 S.E.2d 466 (1992).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Function of "Whole Record" Test.
   
   - The "whole record" test is not a tool of judicial intrusion; instead, it merely gives a reviewing court the capability to determine whether an administrative decision has a rational basis in the evidence. North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 293 S.E.2d 664 (1982), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 131</cite>, 301 S.E.2d 78 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Whole Record" Test.
   
   - In reviewing an agency's decision, the superior court applies the "whole record" test, which requires the examination of all competent evidence to determine if the administrative agency's decision is supported by substantial evidence. Rector v. North Carolina Sheriffs' Educ. &amp; Training Stds. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 406 S.E.2d 613 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The whole record test is applied when determining whether a decision is arbitrary and capricious. Rector v. North Carolina Sheriffs' Educ. &amp; Training Stds. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 406 S.E.2d 613 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The applicable scope of review is the "whole record" test. When the test is applied, the reviewing court is required to take into account all of the evidence, including that which supports the findings and contradictory evidence. Crowell Constructors, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 716, 421 S.E.2d 612 (1992), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 343</cite>, 426 S.E.2d 704 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under G.S. 150B-51(b)(5), upon judicial appeal from an agency, the trial court may reverse or modify an agency's decision if it is unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted; the "whole record" test requires the reviewing court to examine all competent evidence to determine whether the agency decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the administrative findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record, are conclusive upon a reviewing court. Farber v. N.C. Psychology Bd., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 569 S.E.2d 287 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 612</cite>, 574 S.E.2d 679 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an assigned error contended that an agency violated G.S. 150B-51(b)(1), (2), (3), or (4), a trial court engaged in de novo review, under which the trial court considered the matter anew and freely substituted its own judgment for the agency's, but with respect to G.S. 150B-51(b)(5) or (6), the reviewing court applied the "whole record test," under which it could not substitute its judgment for the agency's as between two conflicting views, even though it could reasonably have reached a different result had it reviewed the matter de novo; rather, the court had to examine all the record evidence to determine whether there was substantial evidence to justify the agency's decision, and substantial evidence was relevant evidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Overcash v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 635 S.E.2d 442 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 220</cite>, 642 S.E.2d 445 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Whole Record" Test Inappropriate
   
   - The trial court erred in applying the "Whole Record" test where the appellant/ex-police officer alleged that the appellee/civil service board incorrectly applied the law in terminating his employment. The trial court was required to review that decision "de novo." Jordan v. Civil Serv. Bd. for Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 575, 528 S.E.2d 927 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Substantial Evidence" Defined.
   
   - Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. It is more than a scintilla or a permissible inference. Lackey v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 231</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 171 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence is that which a reasonable mind would regard as adequately supporting a particular conclusion. Walker v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 397 S.E.2d 350 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 98</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 430 (1991).

       </p>
       <p>
        Standard of judicial review set forth in former G.S. 150A-51(5) is known as the "whole record" test
   
   and must be distinguished from both de novo review and the "any competent evidence" standard of review. Thompson v. Wake County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 406</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 538 (1977); North Carolina A &amp; T Univ. v. Kimber, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C.

        In reviewing an administrative decision to determine whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence, the appellate court must apply the "whole record" test. Leiphart v.

App.</cite> 339, 342 S.E.2d 914, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 507</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 862 (1986), decided under former G.S. 150A-51.
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether reversal or modification of an administrative decision is appropriate under former G.S. 150A-51(5), the test applied to the evidence must be the "whole record" test. Community Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. North Carolina Sav. &amp; Loan Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 259 S.E.2d 373 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Court Must Consider All Evidence.
   
   - The applicable scope of review of the decision of an administrative agency is the "whole record" test. In applying the whole record test, the court must consider all the evidence, including that which supports the findings and contradictory evidence. Mount Olive Home Health Care Agency, Inc. v. N.C. Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 336 S.E.2d 625 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "whole record" test requires the court to take into account all the evidence, both that which supports the decision of the Commission and that which in fairness detracts from it. Leiphart v. North Carolina School of Arts, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 342 S.E.2d 914, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 507</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 862 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court of Appeals review of an administrative agency's decision is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, and court may reverse or modify the agency's decision only if it violates one of five statutory grounds.
   Court will determine if the agency's findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are affected by error of law or unsupported by substantial evidence admissible under G.S. 150B-29(a), 150B-30, or 150B-31 in view of the entire record as submitted. North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 394 S.E.2d 285 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Examining the "Whole Record" to Determine If Substantial Evidence Supports Agency's Decision.
   
   - The reviewing court is required to examine all of the competent evidence, pleadings, etc., which comprise the "whole record" to determine if there is substantial evidence in the record to support the administrative tribunal's findings and conclusions. Community Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. North Carolina Sav. &amp; Loan Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 259 S.E.2d 373 (1979); Henderson v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 372 S.E.2d 887 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        To determine whether an agency's findings are supported by substantial evidence, the reviewing court applies the "whole record" test. Employment Sec. Comm'n v. Peace, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 313, 470 S.E.2d 63 (1996), review granted, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 640</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 706 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Erroneous conclusion that a dentist violated the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners' (Board) Record Content Rule by not recording reasons for prescribing medication did not affect the dentist's substantial rights because: (1) the Board had the authority pursuant to the clear language of G.S. 90-41(a)(12), which was more specific than the general limitation on an agency's rule enforcement power in G.S. 150B-18, and thereby controlling, to discipline the dentist for negligence in the practice of dentistry, and (2) substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the dentist's failure to record such reasons was negligent. Walker v. N.C. State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 782 S.E.2d 518 (2016), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 517</cite>, 796 S.E.2d 784, 2017 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Including Contradictory and Conflicting Evidence.
   
   - The "whole record" rule set forth in former G.S. 150A-51(5) requires the court, in determining the substantiality of evidence supporting the board's decision, to take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from the weight of the board's evidence. Under the whole evidence rule, the court may not consider the evidence which in and of itself justifies the board's result, without taking into account contradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn. Thompson v. Wake County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 406</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 538 (1977); Chesnutt v.

        Consideration of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a decision under the "whole record" test does not allow the Supreme Court to replace the agency's judgment where there are two reasonably conflicting views. However, the Supreme Court is required to take into account the evidence supporting the agency's decision as well as the evidence that detracts from the weight of that evidence and its decision. In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "whole record" test properly takes into account the specialized expertise of the staff of an administrative agency, and thus does not allow the reviewing court to substitute its own judgment for that of the agency. It does require, however, that the court take into account evidence in the record which fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence the agency relied upon to make its decision. High Rock Lake Ass'n v. North Carolina Envtl. Mgt. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 276 S.E.2d 472 (1981).

        Testimony of All Witnesses.
   
   - Under the whole record test, judge reviewing an administrative decision must consider the complete testimony of all the witnesses. In re Environmental Mgt. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 135, 280 S.E.2d 520 (1981).

        The reviewing court must take into account contradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn and determine whether the administrative decision had a rational basis in the evidence.

        Trial court's failure to remand a final agency decision

        Judgment Held to Meet Requirements of Section.
   
   - Where the judgment recited that the court had reviewed the record and matters on file and had considered the oral arguments and relevant statutory provisions, and based on these considerations, the judge concluded that declaratory ruling was not erroneous as a matter of law and was due to be affirmed, the judgment met all the requirements of this section and was clearly sufficient as a matter of law.

       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court applied the "whole record test," the correct standard of review, to determine the sufficiency of the evidence, thus, no further findings were necessary where the court determined that the Real Estate Commission properly refused to license an applicant on the basis that he did not possess the requisite integrity because he had been convicted of soliciting a crime against nature. Hodgkins v. North Carolina Real Estate Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 504 S.E.2d 789 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly applied the whole record test as the standard of review to a decision by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission to approve a dam and reservoir project, and the trial court properly concluded that there was substantial competent evidence to support the Commission's determination that the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources provided reasonable assurance that the State of North Carolina's water quality standards would not be violated by the proposed project. Deep River Citizens' Coalition v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 206, 598 S.E.2d 565 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the trial court did not specify the standard of review it applied, detail its findings of fact, or delineate its conclusions of law, appellate review of the whole record and transcripts showed no grounds existed to warrant reversal of the State Personnel Commission's [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] final decision to reinstate a trainee with the Department of Revenue who was terminated during a probationary period because of discrimination based upon his religious practices.

        Substantial evidence existed to support findings by administrative law judge and trial court that employee who was not promoted by a state agency met her burden to show that the agency intentionally discriminated against her, where the employee presented evidence from which the finder of fact could conclude she was more qualified than the successful applicant based on her education, seniority, overall record with the agency, outstanding grades on performance reports, and higher scores on the interviewing and screening tests.

        Conflicting Evidence.
   
   - When evidence is conflicting, the standard for judicial review of administrative decisions is that of the "whole record" test. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 381</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 547, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 107</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 300 (1980), overruled on other grounds, In re Redmond, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 490</cite>, 797 S.E.2d 275, 2017 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The "whole record" test does not allow the reviewing court to replace the board's judgment as between two reasonable conflicting views, even though the court could justifiably have reached a different result had the matter been before it de novo. Wilkie v. North Carolina Wildlife Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 455 S.E.2d 871 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The whole record test is not a tool of judicial intrusion;
   
   instead it merely gives a reviewing court the capability to determine whether an administrative decision has a rational basis in the evidence. Thus, the task before the trial court is to consider all the evidence, both that which supports the decision of the board and that which detracts from it. Goodwin v. Goldsboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 312 S.E.2d 892, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 304</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 680 (1984).
       </p>

        The "whole record" test is not a tool of judicial intrusion and the court is not permitted to replace the agency's judgment with its own even though the court might rationally justify reaching a different conclusion.

        Court May Not Replace Agency's Judgment with Its Own.
   
   - The "whole record" test set forth in subdivision (5) of former G.S. 150A-51 does not allow the reviewing court to replace the board's judgment as between two reasonably conflicting views, even though the court could justifiably have reached a different result had the matter been before it de novo.

        The "whole record" test is distinguishable from both de novo review and the "any competent evidence" standard of review. Under the "whole record" test, the reviewing court cannot replace the board's judgment between two reasonably conflicting views, even though the court could have reached a different conclusion had the matter been before it de novo. Boehm v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The whole record test does not allow the reviewing court to replace the board's judgment as between two reasonably conflicting views, even though the court could justifiably have reached a different result had the matter been heard before it de novo. Community Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. North Carolina Sav. &amp; Loan Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 259 S.E.2d 373 (1979); Dailey v.

        No court may weigh evidence presented to the State board and substitute its evaluation of the evidence for that of the board. In re Appeal of Amp, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 547</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 752 (1975); North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The mere existence of conflicting evidence does not permit the reviewing court to weigh the evidence and substitute its determination for that of the administrative agency. The credibility of the witnesses and the resolution of conflicts in their testimony is a matter for the agency, not a reviewing court. Dailey v. North Carolina State Bd. of Dental Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 299 S.E.2d 473, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 710</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 219 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The whole record test does not allow the reviewing court to replace the board's judgment as between two reasonably conflicting views, even though the court could justifiably have reached a different result had the matter been before it de novo. On the other hand, the whole record rule requires the court, in determining the substantiality of evidence supporting the board's decision, to take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from the weight of the board's evidence. Goodwin v. Goldsboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 312 S.E.2d 892, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 304</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 680 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "whole record" test does not permit the reviewing court to substitute its judgment for the agency's as between two reasonably conflicting views; however, it does require the court to take into account both the evidence justifying the agency's decision and the contradictory evidence from which a different result could be reached. Floyd v. North Carolina Dep't of Commerce, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 392 S.E.2d 660 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In applying the whole record test, reasonable but conflicting views emerge from the evidence, the Court of Appeals cannot replace the agency's judgment with its own. It must, however, take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence which supports the decision. Ultimately it must determine whether the decision has a rational basis in the evidence. GMC v. Kinlaw, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 521, 338 S.E.2d 114 (1985); In re Kozy, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The reviewing court may reverse or modify an agency's decision if the substantial rights of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because the agency's findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted; this standard, the "whole record" test, does not allow the reviewing court to replace the agency's judgment as between two reasonably conflicting views, even though the court could justifiably have reached a different result had the matter been before it de novo. Mendenhall v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 459 S.E.2d 820 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The whole record test does not permit a reviewing court to replace the Disciplinary Hearing Commission's judgment as between two reasonably conflicting views, even though the court may have justifiably reached a different decision. North Carolina State Bar v. Maggiolo, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 475 S.E.2d 727 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the trial court impermissibly replaced the administrative law judge's judgment of the credibility of two witnesses with its own, this error was not prejudicial, as this finding had no bearing on the ultimate issue in the case. N.C. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety v. Greene, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 616 S.E.2d 594 (2005).

        Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence.
   
   - It is for the administrative agency to determine the weight and sufficiency of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, to draw inferences from the facts, and to appraise conflicting and circumstantial evidence.

        Agency's Findings of Fact Supported by Competent Evidence Are Conclusive.
   
   - The administrative findings of fact made by the State Board of Opticians, if supported by competent, material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record, are conclusive upon a reviewing court, and not within the scope of its reviewing powers. In re Berman, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 612</cite>, 96 S.E.2d 836 (1957); In re Hawkins, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        When the judge of the superior court sits as an appellate court to review the decision of an administrative agency pursuant to this section, the findings of fact made by the administrative agency, if supported by competent, material and substantial evidence when viewed on the record as a whole, are conclusive upon the reviewing court. North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 293 S.E.2d 664 (1982), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 131</cite>, 301 S.E.2d 78 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law of this State regarding the respective roles of the administrative agency and the reviewing court concerning conflicting evidence is premised on the notion that the credibility of the witnesses and the resolution of conflicts in their testimony is for the agency, not a reviewing court, and the findings of the agency supported by competent evidence, are conclusive upon judicial review of the agency's order.

        When the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Resources, Division of Facility Services, Certificate of Need Section, denied a health system's request for a certificate of need (CON) to build a hospital and granted a CON to the system's competitor, competent evidence supported the agency's finding that, even though the system had previously been granted a CON for a different project, the system was not going to complete that project, and a requirement that the agency "consider" the previously granted CON did not require the agency to find that the system would successfully develop the previously approved project and factor a hypothetical completed hospital into the agency's determinations regarding the population to be served and the possibility of duplicative services.

        Administrative law judge's (ALJ) conclusion that an agency did not establish just cause for a state employee's dismissal was upheld because: (1) the ALJ did not have to defer to the agency in finding if just cause existed, as the agency had the burden to show just cause, and (2) substantial evidence supported the ALJ's factual findings that the employee's unacceptable personal conduct did not warrant the sanction of dismissal, making those findings binding on appeal, as the ALJ was the sole fact-finder. Harris v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 798 S.E.2d 127, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 386</cite>, 808 S.E.2d 142, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 1020 (2017).

        Court May Not Make Findings at Variance Therewith.
   
   - The court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the State Board of Opticians in making findings of fact. In re Berman, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 612</cite>, 96 S.E.2d 836 (1957).

        Where the superior court, at the instance of appellant, found additional facts which the Tax Review Board had, although requested, refused to make, the court, in making these findings, weighed the evidence and substituted its evaluation of the evidence for that of the Board, and in so doing it exceeded its right of review. Clark Equip Co. v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 269</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 327 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a review of an order of the Property Tax Commission, the superior court is without authority to make findings at variance with the findings of the board when the findings of the board are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence. In re Appeal of Amp, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 547</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 752 (1975).

        When Court May Make Findings at Variance with Agency's.
   
   - Where the reviewing court determines that the findings of the agency are not supported by substantial evidence, the court may make findings of variance with those of the agency. Scroggs v.

        Finding of Fact in Accordance with Uncontradicted Evidence.
   
   - When an administrative body finds a fact in accordance with uncontradicted evidence, little remains for the reviewing court to do, other than to find no error in the administrative body's election to accord the necessary weight and credibility to the testimony. North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 293 S.E.2d 664 (1982), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 131</cite>, 301 S.E.2d 78 (1983).

        Agency's Judgment Must Be Affirmed If Supported by Competent Evidence.
   
   - The reviewing court, while obligated to consider evidence of record that detracts from the administrative ruling, is not free to weigh all of the evidence and reach its own conclusions on the merits. If, after all the record has been reviewed, substantial competent evidence is found which would support the agency ruling, the ruling must stand. Substantial evidence in this context has been defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Dailey v. North Carolina State Bd. of Dental Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 299 S.E.2d 473, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 710</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 219 (1983).

        Trial court erred in applying the whole record test when it reversed a decision of the North Carolina Mining Commission, approving the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources' (DENR) revocation of petitioner's permit under the Mining Act of 1971, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.074.html#t74a07s74-46" target="_blank">G.S. 74-46</a></cite> et seq., because, contrary to the trial court's conclusion, the DENR presented substantial evidence that petitioner's mining operations had a significant adverse impact on the Appalachian Trail where a witness testified to the impact, the DENR presented three analyses submitted by their consultants reporting in detail the negative impacts, and petitioner submitted no evidence to the contrary.

        North Carolina State Banking Commission's decision denying the applications for licensure for two mortgage loan officers was upheld on appeal and the lower court did not err by relying upon a previously entered default judgment against the two since the applicants' prior mortgage company had been awarded that default judgment for engaging in a pattern of business operations regarding false and misleading representations, and they were not exempt from the qualifications of G.S. 53-243.05 [see now 53-244.010 et seq.]pursuant to a grandfather provision, because that grandfather provision only exempted already licensed persons from taking the three-year training requirement. State ex rel. Banking Comm'n Against Weiss v. N.C. Comm'r of Banks, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 620 S.E.2d 540 (2005).

        Because evidence before the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] (SPC) showed that, based on her interview and writing sample scores, an employee ranked lowest out of all of the applicants for a position, and two of the panel members testified that based on these rankings, they considered the chosen candidate to be the best applicant for that position, the trial court did not err when it failed to limit its application of the whole-record test in determining whether the decision of the SPC was supported by substantial competent evidence. N.C. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety v. Greene, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 616 S.E.2d 594 (2005).

        Substantial evidence supported a decision by the Division of Land Resources to approve an applicant's request for modifications to its mining permit because none of the criteria in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.074.html#t74a07s74-51ol1d1" target="_blank">G.S. 74-51(d)(1)</a></cite>-(7) were implicated, and that, to the extent any of the criteria were implicated, any adverse affects, including, inter alia, decreased wildlife, structural damage, scenic effects, and groundwater concerns, would be mitigated by the applicant as required under the terms of the permit modification.

        Trial court properly reversed order of state board of elections ordering a new election based on the fact that it did not agree with the propriety of the county board's reliance on the affidavits of ineligible voters to show the effect of those votes on the outcome of the election, as the established law of the State holds that such testimony is proper.

        Findings of Fact by Judge Not Required.
   
   - When the judge of the superior court sits as an appellate court to review the decision of an administrative agency pursuant to former G.S. 150A-51, the judge is not required to make findings of fact. Faulkner v. North Carolina State Hearing Aid Dealers and Fitters Bd., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 222, 247 S.E.2d 668 (1978).

        Applicability of "Whole Record" Test to Insurance Ratemaking Proceedings.
   
   - The "whole record" test is applicable to judicial review of administrative decisions in North Carolina, and both former G.S. 58-9.6(b)(5) (now G.S. 58-2-90(b)(5)) and former G.S. 150A-51(5) put forth that test as a proper standard of judicial review of insurance ratemaking proceedings.

       <p>
        The superior court did not exceed the bounds of appropriate judicial review

        Record Devoid of Substantial Evidence.
   
   - Department of Human Resources erred in terminating spousal support where the record is clear that nursing home resident wanted his "money" but the record was devoid of any substantial evidence that he intended to apply all of his income, exceeding his personal needs allowance, to his nursing care, rather than towards the support of his wife.

        Improper Application.
   
   - Although a trial court properly reviewed, under G.S. 150B-51(b)(5), a final agency decision of a contested case petition filed pursuant to G.S. 150B-23, the trial court incorrectly applied the standard of review by making its own findings of fact on unappealed issues.

        Substantial Evidence Supported Administrative Law Judge's Recommended Decision.
   
   - Substantial evidence supported an administrative law judge's (ALJ) ruling that the North Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) had just cause to dismiss an employee for unacceptable personal conduct where he knowingly violated the DOT's Statement of Understanding and Internet Policy as: (1) the employee's denial of knowledge of the Statement of Understanding was not credible, (2) the employee's claim that he was unaware that he had to obtain his supervisor's approval before installing software on his work computer was not believed by the ALJ, (3) the employee admitted not having permission to install software on his computer, and (4) the unauthorized installation of software was inconsistent with the DOT's objective to ensure that its files and computer network system were properly protected.

        Substantial evidence supported an administrative law judge's factual findings in support of a recommendation to terminate a career state employee because the evidence showed the employee (1) left an inmate in handcuffs despite not regarding the inmate as a threat, (2) did not ensure the inmate was monitored, (3) did not complete reports, and (4) did not accept personal responsibility.

        Infection of an agency decision by consideration of arbitrary and capricious matter is clearly violative of subdivision (6)
   
   of former G.S. 150A-51. North Carolina A &amp; T Univ. v. Kimber, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 270 S.E.2d 492 (1980).

       <p>
        Where an employee has engaged in off-duty criminal conduct,
   
   the agency need not show actual harm to its interests to demonstrate just cause for an employee's dismissal; however, it is well established that administrative agencies may not engage in arbitrary and capricious conduct. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 446 S.E.2d 383 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 309</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 635 (1994).

       <p>
        Rational Nexus Required.
   
   - In cases in which an employee has been dismissed based upon an act of off-duty criminal conduct, the agency must demonstrate that the dismissal is supported by the existence of a rational nexus between the type of criminal conduct committed and the potential adverse impact on the employee's future ability to perform for the agency. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 446 S.E.2d 383 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 309</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 635 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Factors to Consider in Determining If a Nexus Exists.
   
   - In determining whether a rational nexus exists between the type of off-duty criminal activity conducted by the employee and the employee's future ability to do his job, the Commission may consider the following factors: (1) how the conduct may have adversely affected clients or colleagues; (2) the relationship between the work performed by the employee and the type of criminal conduct committed; (3) the likelihood of recurrence of the questioned conduct and how the conduct may affect work performance, work quality, and the agency's goodwill and interests; (4) the proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct to the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings; (5) extenuating or aggravating circumstances; (6) the blameworthiness or praiseworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct; and (7) the presence or absence of any relevant factors in mitigation. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 446 S.E.2d 383 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 309</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 635 (1994).

        Action Held Arbitrary and Capricious.
   
   - Where the Commissioner of Insurance did nothing more, in adopting a complicated and novel formula for determining underwriting profit, than listen to one employee of an insurance department in a sister state which was refining the policy adopted and which was given only limited approval by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, his approach was a clear example of an arbitrary and capricious action by an administrative agency as contemplated by the North Carolina Legislature in establishing that criterion for judicial review in former G.S. 58-9.6(b)(6) (now G.S. 58-2-90(b)(6)) and subdivision (6) of former G.S. 150A-51.

        Action of the Commissioner of Insurance ordering audited data in a ratemaking case was arbitrary and capricious, as contemplated by former G.S. 58-9.6(b)(6) (now G.S. 58-2-90(b)(6)) and subdivision (6) of former G.S. 150A-51, where (1) The order was vague and uncertain in that it did not establish the extent to which examination of "original source documents" was required; (2) It did not make clear whether auditing must be performed by certified public accountants, other accountants, or actuaries; (3) It did not specify the degree of precision and reliability required of "statistical sampling"; (4) It generally did not provide adequate guidelines for compliance with the general conclusion that data in a ratemaking hearing be audited; (5) It included no determination by the Commissioner as to the possibility of performance of his new rule nor whether implementation of the rule would be economically feasible; (6) It included no determination whether statutory time limits could be complied with in face of the new rule; and (7) It included no determination whether the "original source data" contemplated by the new rule was even available for the past years involved in this filing or whether such data, if available, was located in North Carolina or outside the State in the case of the several hundred companies writing insurance in this State.

        Where the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services had never before revoked licenses of ambulance providers for understaffing their ambulances, had no guidelines for such license revocation, and failed to explain adequately its rejection of an administrative law judge's decision to stay revocation, the Department's revocation of a provider's license for understaffing was arbitrary and capricious.

        Where a local board of education appealed a superior court's denial of career status to a teacher, under G.S. 115C-44, the teacher had the burden to show that the board of education's denial of tenure was arbitrary, in that it was not supported by substantial evidence. The board's decision lacked a rational basis in the evidence, and the superior court acted within its authority pursuant to G.S. 150B-51 when it modified the board's decision by directing that the teacher be reinstated with career status.

        Assistant Principal's Procedural Rights Violated.
   
   - Process employed by a county board of education in reaching its decision not to renew an assistant principal's contract violated the assistant's procedural rights because the board based its decision on evidence not contained in the assistant's personnel file and without giving her notice of that evidence and an opportunity to respond to it; thus, the record was insufficient for a determination whether the board's decision was arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, personal, or political.

        School Board's Termination of Teacher Was Not an Abuse of Discretion.
   
   - Where school board took into consideration the attribution rate, the qualifications, certification, evaluations and experience of teachers, and respondent had the lowest level of certification and the least amount of experience, the school board's determination to terminate respondent was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. Taborn v. Hammonds, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 371 S.E.2d 736 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 546</cite>, 380 S.E.2d 513 (1989).

        State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] abused its discretion
   
   and lacked careful and impartial decisionmaking when it passed over personnel office employee and filled a vacant position with an applicant who did not meet state qualifications for the position and who had filed her application and had been effectively offered the job a month before it was posted.

        Assessment of Penalty Held Not Arbitrary or Capricious.
   
   - Where the penalty assessed by the Department of Natural Resources and Community Development (now the Department of Environment and Natural Resources) was within the statutory limits provided in G.S. 113A-64, and the record evidenced the secretary's reasoned weighing of the penalty factors announced in 15 N.C. Adm. Code 4C.006, which were reasonably related to the act's administration and enforcement, the department's assessment of the monetary penalty in this case was not arbitrary and capricious. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Dismissal Held Not Arbitrary or Capricious.
   
   - Department of Human Resource's dismissal of employee's appeal on grounds it was filed one day after the deadline was neither arbitrary or capricious where employee was informed of the time limits for perfecting appeal, offered assistance for complying with appeal procedures since legal representation was not allowed at that time of the proceeding, and employee's apparent justification for filing late was difficulty in retaining an attorney.

        School Suspension Held Not Arbitrary or Capricious.
   
   - Even though a student failed to preserve an equal protection challenge to a suspension by failing to assign error or present authority, the argument was meritless at any rate under arbitrary and capricious review because there was a gender-neutral reason for a longer suspension; prior incidents of "shanking" at a high school did not result in the exposure of buttocks or genitalia.

        Banning Sports Fan for Life Not Arbitrary or Capricious.
   
   - In a case where a sports fan was given a lifetime ban from a university's athletic facilities, the decision was not arbitrary and capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence since it was based on a series of incidents that occurred over a number of years. The sports fan had harassed athletes, family members, staff members, and other fans over the years. Donnelly v. Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 763 S.E.2d 154 (2014).

        Showing Necessary to Obtain Relief from Valuations of Property for Taxation.
   
   - In order to obtain relief from valuations upon their property by the State Board of Assessment (now the Property Tax Commission), appellant electric membership corporations must show that the methods used in determining true value were illegal and arbitrary, and that appellants were substantially injured by a resulting excessive valuation of their property. Albemarle Elec. Membership Corp. v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 402</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 811 (1972); In re Land &amp; Mineral Co., <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C.

        It is only when the actions of the State Board of Assessment (now the Property Tax Commission) are found to be arbitrary and capricious that courts will interfere with tax assessments because of asserted violations of the due process clause.

        Dismissal Not Required.
   
   - Trial court properly conducted a de novo review under G.S. 150B-51(c) of a decision of the North Carolina State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission], as the commission did not adopt an ALJ decision; although the trial court concluded that a captain in an enforcement section of a department of motor vehicles violated a general order in obtaining funding for a captains' meeting, it properly found that there was not cause for dismissal as: (1) the captain held a good faith belief that the captain's actions were within the accepted practice of section employees; (2) a reasonable person in the captain's position would have expected to be warned before being dismissed for such actions; and (3) the captain violated the order, but did not willfully violate the order.

       <p>
        Evidence Held Sufficient.
   
   - There was substantial evidence in the record to support State Code Officials Qualification Board's findings and conclusions as to the revocation of petitioner's certificates based on Board's findings of several different violations of the N.C. Uniform Residential Building Code; many of the violations were plainly visible and should have been discovered by an inspection performed with ordinary care and prudence and many of the remaining violations, although less obvious or more technical, could have been discovered by an inspection performed with ordinary care and prudence. Bunch v. North Carolina Code Officials Qualifications Bd., <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 293, 458 S.E.2d 248 (1995), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 97</cite>, 468 S.E.2d 55 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on employee's qualifications found by both an administrative law judge and the trial court, substantial evidence existed showing that the employee was objectively better qualified for the position to which another worker was promoted. Therefore, the administrative law judge and the trial court properly found as fact and concluded as a matter of law that the employee was more qualified for the position than the other worker to support her claim of race and gender discrimination. Gordon v. N.C. Dep't of Corr., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 618 S.E.2d 280 (2005).

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in reversing an administrative law judge's decision that a corporation's decertification as a provider of HIV case management services by the AIDS Care Unit at respondent North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, (DHHS) was unjustified because the trial court properly applied the de novo standard, in addressing the corporation's contention that the actions of DHHS were arbitrary and capricious; DHHS's actions in decertification of the corporation and not allowing corrective action were not arbitrary or capricious because other HIV case management providers that were allowed corrective action did not have problems with all of their case managers correctly filling out progress notes and billing for services that did not match up to their documentation, and the corporation and other similarly situated providers had notice as to DHHS's requirements to remain certified.

       Scope of Appellate Review.
   
   - The scope of review to be applied by the appellate court under this section is the same as it is for other civil cases. That is, it must be determined whether the trial court committed any errors of law. American Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Ingram, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 38, 303 S.E.2d 649, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 819</cite>, 310 S.E.2d 348 (1983); Tay v. Flaherty, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, the appellate court examines the trial court's order for error of law, determining whether the trial court exercised the appropriate scope of review and, if appropriate, deciding whether the court did so properly. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 446 S.E.2d 383 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 309</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 635 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an appellate court reviews the decision of a lower court, (as opposed to when it reviews an administrative agency's decision on direct appeal), the scope of review to be applied by the appellate court under this section is the same as it is for other civil cases. Henderson v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 372 S.E.2d 887 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Court of Appeal's review of the superior court's determination under this section, is limited to whether the superior court made any errors in law in light of the record as a whole. Scroggs v. North Carolina Criminal Justice Educ. &amp; Training Stds. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 699, 400 S.E.2d 742 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to this section, court review of a trial court's consideration of a final agency decision is to determine whether the trial court committed any errors of law which would be based upon its failure to properly apply the review standard set forth in G.S. 150B-51. Sherrod v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 414 S.E.2d 50 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court found that the superior court, which initially reviewed a decision of the Board of Pharmacy reprimanding a permitee pharmacy chain for negligent acts of its licensed pharmacists, had not erred in finding no arbitrary or capricious action by the Board in choosing a sanction; case law already made it clear that the chain could be vicariously responsible for the pharmacists' actions, and so any sanction listed as applicable to a pharmacist could also be applied against the chain. CVS Pharm., Inc. v. N.C. Bd. of Pharm., <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 591 S.E.2d 567 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court found that the trial court's conclusion of law that the teaching coordinator was not eligible for the substantial salary increase that accompanied the teaching coordinator's attainment of national certification could not be supported by a reading of the relevant statute, G.S. 115C-296.2(b)(2); that statute's language was broad enough to include the teaching coordinator as eligible for the salary increase and the teaching coordinator met all of the statute's requirements for the increase.rev'd, remanded, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 679</cite>, 652 S.E.2d 251 (2007) Rainey v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Instruction, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 666, 640 S.E.2d 790 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action arising from allegations of age discrimination, while the superior court properly applied both a de novo review and the whole-record test to the respective issues on appeal under G.S. 150B-51(b) when it reviewed the final decision of the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] (SPC), it erred when it improperly substituted its judgment for that of the SPC under the whole-record test. Thus, remand was ordered for the superior court to affirm the SPC's final agency decision. Trotter v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 659 S.E.2d 749 (2008).

       Employee had abandoned any challenge to the findings of fact where she did not challenge specific finding, refer to any particular portion of the record, address any particular finding as not supported by the evidence, or raise any issues with findings she considered material.

      <p>
       Appellate Review of Improper Constitutional Consideration.
   
   - Although the trial court improperly considered a constitutional issue, where that court vacated the Department of Natural Resources and Community Development's assessment based on an interpretation of N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   3, which the department properly challenged on appeal, the Court of Appeals would address that constitutional ground in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction.

App.</cite> 1, 373 S.E.2d 572, supersedeas allowed on reconsideration, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 625</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 873 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Examination for Error - A Twofold Task.
   
   - The appellate court should examine the trial court's order for error of law, which has been described as a twofold task: (1) determining whether the trial court exercised the appropriate scope of review and, if appropriate, (2) deciding whether the court did so properly. Amanini v. N.C. Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 443 S.E.2d 114 (1994).
   <br />

      <p>
       Legal proceeding must be prosecuted by a legal person,
   
   whether it be a natural person who is sui juris or a group of individuals or other entity having the capacity to sue and be sued, such as a corporation, partnership, unincorporated association, or governmental body or agency. Even a class action must be prosecuted or defended by one or more named members of the class. A legal proceeding prosecuted by an aggregation of anonymous individuals, known only to their counsel, is a phenomenon unknown to the law of this jurisdiction. In re Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 180 S.E.2d 439 (1971).

      <p>
       Rule that appeal to appellate division may be prosecuted only at the instance of a party or parties aggrieved
   
   by the judgment of the court or tribunal from which the appeal is taken applies with as much force to proceedings governed by former Article 33 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html" target="_blank">Chapter 143</a></cite> as to ordinary civil cases.

       No statutory authority exists for the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] to review an administrative law judge's recommended decision
   
   in a case involving an exempt employee. Johnson v. Natural Resources &amp; Community Dev., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 391 S.E.2d 48 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Cross-Appeal as Waiver.
   
   - Where trial court erroneously failed to render conclusions concerning all statutory grounds for review raised by the petition for review, petitioners' failure to cross-appeal any such error to the appellate court waived its consideration on appeal. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 373 S.E.2d 572, supersedeas allowed on reconsideration, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 625</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 873 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal Must Follow Theory of Trial.
   
   - Where petitioner relied upon jurisdiction under former G.S. 143-314 before the trial court, on appeal he could not argue that the trial court had original subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7As0Va20s7A-240" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-240</a></cite> based upon a constitutional right to hearing and judicial review, since an appeal must follow the theory of the trial. Grissom v. North Carolina Dep't of Revenue, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 381, 238 S.E.2d 311 (1977), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 183</cite>, 241 S.E.2d 517 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial Evidence Found.
   
   - Where the trial court made new findings of fact upon de novo review of an administrative decision, the findings were supported by substantial evidence since they were consistent with the testimony of witnesses at a hearing before the administrative law judge. Cape Med. Transp., Inc. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 14, 590 S.E.2d 8 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence in the record supported an administrative law judge's findings and its dismissal of a day care's petition for a contested case hearing where the day care filed nothing in nearly six months following the filing of the petition, despite receiving several orders from the administrative law judge to file and serve prehearing statements and other responses to motions. Lincoln v. N.C. HHS, Nutrition Branch, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 616 S.E.2d 622 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Remand for Further Findings.
   
   - Denial of Medicaid benefits to an undocumented immigrant was reversed and remanded for further findings as the findings were inadequate to support the conclusions of law that the Medicaid benefits for rehabilitative services and chemotherapy, following surgery for medullary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and spinal cord malignancy, were not to cover the costs of an emergency medical condition. Luna v. Div. of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 589 S.E.2d 917 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Demotion Upheld.
   
   - Summary judgment for a state agency employer in an employee's petition for review of his demotion was proper where the conduct admitted by the employee constituted "unacceptable personal conduct," and the State Personnel Commission [now the North Carolina Human Resources Commission] determined that its regulations and work rules did not contain any qualification or exception for the explanations asserted by the employee. Hilliard v. N.C. Dep't of Corr., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 620 S.E.2d 14 (2005).
