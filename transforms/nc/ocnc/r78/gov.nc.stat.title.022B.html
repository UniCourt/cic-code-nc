                        responsible for those damages. However, insofar as the indemnity claim related to defective installation, summary judgment was denied as the contractor asserted claims only against the subcontractor. New Bern Riverfront Dev., LLC

                        due to defendants' negligence and not because of plaintiff's own negligence. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Ogden Plant Maint. Co., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 548 S.E.2d 807 (2001),

                        with the agreement to perform was invalid unless the agreement fell under an exception stated in this section. Miller Brewing Co. v.

                        Even assuming an indemnification clause violated G.S. 22B-1 because a portion of it served to indemnify a contractor against its own negligence, the problem could be solved by simply removing the offending phrase; the indemnification clause, on its face,
                        was self-limiting as indemnification was restricted to damages: (1) that arose or resulted from performance of a subcontractor's work; and (2) that were "permitted by law." Vecellio &amp; Grogan, Inc. v. Piedmont Drilling &amp;

                    Any provision in a contract requiring a party to the contract to waive his right to a jury trial is unconscionable as a matter of law and the provision shall be unenforceable. This section does not prohibit parties from entering into agreements to arbitrate

        Statute Permits Parties to Enter Into Arbitration Agreements.
       </b> - Statute expressly permits parties to enter into arbitration agreements; the statute cannot be read as equating contracts with an arbitration clause to those contracts that do not contain an arbitration clause, and
                        the language of this section could not be clearer: the proscription against contractual waivers of jury trials does not prohibit parties from entering into agreements to arbitrate or engage in other forms of alternative dispute

                        An agreement to arbitrate a dispute is not an unenforceable contract requiring waiver of a jury; thus, the trial court erred in concluding that because arbitration provision did not provide for trial of facts by a jury that it was unconscionable and unenforceable

        Arbitration Agreement Not Unconscionable.
       </b> - Trial court erred when it concluded that an arbitration rider was unconscionable because the notice provision simply explained that by agreeing to arbitration, any disputes would be settled without a jury, and such
                        contractual provisions that defined or explained arbitration did not run afoul of the statute; including an explanation of what a party forfeited when it agreed to arbitrate any disputes in an arbitration agreement does not render
                        the arbitration agreement unenforceable. Wygand v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams., - N.C. App. - , 829 S.E.2d 681 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Because the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempted state statutes that rendered arbitration agreements unenforceable, the statute could not be interpreted or used to set aside an arbitration rider, and the trial court erred when it purported to interpret
                        the statute to render the arbitration rider unconscionable; the contract dictated that FAA governed review of the arbitration rider. Wygand v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams., - N.C. App. - , 829 S.E.2d 681 (2019).
