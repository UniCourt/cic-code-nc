     NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    The North Carolina Uniform Custodial Trust Act (hereinafter "the North Carolina Act") is based upon the Uniform Custodial Trust Act (hereinafter "the Uniform Act"). The most significant differences between the North Carolina Act and the Uniform Act are (i) the deletion of references to multiple beneficiaries, (ii) changes made to be consistent with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, relating to guardianship, (iii) the addition of witness and acknowledgment requirements for writings or instruments designating someone other than the beneficiary's estate to receive the custodial trust property at the beneficiary's death, and (iv) the addition of a limitation on the aggregate value of transfers or declarations of property to the corpus of a custodial trust. The preference for single beneficiaries reflects a belief that the complexity raised by multiple beneficiaries is not justified by any competing benefit when the ease of creating a separate custodial trust for each individual beneficiary is considered. The drafters believed that although there is no absolute need for the North Carolina Act to be consistent with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite>, consistency in the various types of guardians, coordination of the use of the terms "incapacitated" and "incompetency," and the incorporation of the procedures and flexibility of Chapter 35A are all desirable goals.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is believed that the North Carolina Act will be used for two main purposes. The first will be for the creation of a statutory trust with a built-in set of principles and forms that can be used for providing support to an incapacitated person. The second purpose is to allow an individual, while competent, to designate a person to act as the individual's trustee in the event of the individual's incapacity.
   </p>
   <p>
    The North Carolina Commentary reflects changes to the Uniform Act that were made by the drafters. The Commentary discusses most but not all changes made by the General Assembly.

     OFFICIAL COMMENT
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    (1) "Adult" is a person 18 years of age for the purpose of custodial trusts. The result of this is that a person 18 years of age will be eligible to be a custodial trustee under this Act, although he or she may not be eligible under UTMA since minor custodianships under UTMA may run to age 21 and the minor could in some cases be older than the custodian. As the Comments under Section 1 of UTMA explain, the age of 21 was retained under that Act because the Internal Revenue Code continues to permit a "minority trust" under Section 2053(c), to continue in effect until age 21 and because it was believed that most transferors creating trusts or custodianships for minors would prefer to retain the property under management for the benefit of the young person as long as possible. The difference has little or no practical consequence and serves the purpose of each Act.
   </p>
   <p>
    (3) "Conservator" is defined broadly to permit identification of a person functioning as a conservator.
   </p>
   <p>
    (4) "Court" means ____________ court. Here the likelihood is that most states would utilize the same court, e.g., the probate court, that deals with conservators and estates.
   </p>
   <p>
    (5 and 6) The terms, "custodial trust property" and "custodial trustee," are used throughout to identify clearly the statutory trust property and trustee under this Act. The statutory trust concept is used throughout the Act.
   </p>
   <p>
    (7) A definition of guardian has been included and is based on the Uniform Probate Code Section 5-103(6).
   </p>
   <p>
    (8) A definition of incapacitated has been included, for the purpose of this Act, because incapacity of the beneficiary converts the trust from a revocable trust to a discretionary trust. The definition is taken from the Uniform Probate Code Section 5-401(c) relating to the person who is unable to manage property. Compare Uniform Probate Code Section 5-103(7). Note that Section 10(a)(ii) permits a transferor to direct that the trust shall be administered as one for an incapacitated person. Section 10 deals specifically with the determination of incapacity.
   </p>
   <p>
    (10) The beneficiary's family is broadly defined to identify persons who may have standing to seek judicial intervention or accounting (Sections 13 and 15).
   </p>
   <p>
    (11) The definition of a person is taken from the Uniform Probate Code Section 1-201(29).
   </p>
   <p>
    (12) Personal representative is broadly defined and the definition reflects that in the Uniform Probate Code Section 1-201(30).

    The definition of "adult" is modified to mean an individual who is at least 21 rather than 18 years of age. The term "conservator" and its definition are replaced with the term "guardian of the estate" and its definition from the guardianship statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The term "guardian" and its definition are replaced with the term "guardian of the person" and its definition from the guardianship statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The definitions of "guardian of the estate" and "guardian of the person" are modified to include a general guardian or guardian of the estate whose powers are limited in accordance with an order of the court concerning the extent of incompetence under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html#t35As0Ia01s35A-1112ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 35A-1112(d)</a></cite>. The term "general guardian" is added and defined to be a guardian of both the estate and the person. The term "court" is defined to mean the clerk of superior court of this State. The definition of "incapacitated" is modified to substitute "being under 21 years of age" for "minority." The definition of "legal representative" is modified to substitute "guardian of the estate" for "conservator." The definition of "member of the beneficiary's family" is modified to delete the references to "stepchild" and "stepparent," paralleling a change in the North Carolina Uniform Transfers to Minors Act and reflecting the drafters' belief that the inclusion of the references in the definition is undesirable. The definition of "trust company" is modified to refer to a legal entity authorized to exercise general trust powers in North Carolina.

    <b>
     OFFICIAL COMMENT
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Section 2 is the principal provision authorizing the creation of a custodial trust and utilizes the concept of incorporation by reference when the transferee or titleholder of property is designated as custodial trustee under the Act. Section 2 sets forth the general effect of such a transfer. Section 18 provides forms which satisfy the requirements of this section and identifies customary methods of transferring assets to create a custodial trust.
   </p>
   <p>
    Section 2(a) provides that a trust may be created by transfer to another for the benefit of the transferor or another. This is expected to be the most common way in which a custodial trust would be created. However, a custodial trust may also be created by declaration of trust by the owner of property to hold it for the benefit of another as is provided in Section 2(b). A declaration in trust by the owner of property for the sole benefit of the owner is not contemplated by this Act because such an attempt may be considered ineffective as a trust due to the total identity of the trustee and beneficiary. However, the doctrine of merger would not preclude an effective transfer under this Act for the benefit of the transferor and one or more other beneficiaries. See Section 6.
   </p>
   <p>
    A custodial trust could be created by the exercise of a valid power of attorney or power of appointment given by the owner of property as one of the transfers "consistent with law."
   </p>
   <p>
    These alternatives permit the major uses of the custodial trust to be accomplished expeditiously. For example, an older person, wishing to be relieved of management of property may transfer property to another for benefit of the transferor or of the transferor's spouse or child. The declaration may be used to establish a trust of which the owner is trustee to continue management of the property for benefit of another, such as a spouse or child. The trust may include a provision for distribution of assets remaining at the beneficiary's death directly to a named distributee.
   </p>
   <p>
    This Act does not preclude the creation of trusts under other existing law, statutory or nonstatutory, but is designed to facilitate the creation of simple trusts incorporating the provisions of this Act. The written transfer or declaration "consistent with law" requires that the formalities of the transfer of particular property necessary under other law will be observed, e.g., if land is involved, the requirements of a proper deed and recording must be satisfied.
   </p>
   <p>
    Section 2(c) provides for the retention of the beneficial interest in the custodial trust property in the beneficiary and, of course, not in the custodial trustee. The extensive control and benefit in the beneficiary who is not incapacitated maintains the simplicity of the trust and avoids tax complexity. The custodial trustee is given the title to the property and authority to act with regard to the property only as is authorized by the statute. The custodial trustee's powers are enumerated in Section 8.
   </p>
   <p>
    Section 2(e) gives the adult beneficiary, who is not incapacitated, the power to terminate the custodial trust at any time during his or her lifetime. This power of termination exists in any beneficiary who is not incapacitated whether the beneficiary was or was not the transferor. A beneficiary may be determined to be incapacitated or the transferor may designate that the trust is to be administered as a trust for an incapacitated beneficiary under Section 10, in which event the beneficiary does not have the power to terminate. However, the designation of incapacity by the transferor can be modified by the trustee or the court by reason of changed circumstances pursuant to Section 10. The Act precludes termination by exercise of a durable power of attorney if the beneficiary is incompetent (Section 7(f)). If the donor prefers not to permit the beneficiary the power to terminate or to designate the beneficiary as incapacitated under Section 10, an individually drafted trust outside the scope of this Act would seem appropriate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon termination of a custodial trust, the custodial trust property must be distributed as provided in Section 17.
   </p>
   <p>
    A transfer under this Act is irrevocable except to the extent the beneficiary may terminate it. Hence, a transfer to a trustee for benefit of a person other than the transferor is not revocable by the transferor. If a power of revocation were retained by the transferor, that would be a trust outside the scope of this Act and enforceable under general law pursuant to subsection 2(h).
   </p>
   <p>
    This Act does not provide for protection of the custodial trust assets from the claims of creditors of the beneficiary, whether those are general or governmental creditors. Other laws of the state remain unaffected. In this regard, unusual problems of handicapped persons and the coordination of resources and state or federal services call for special provision and planning outside the scope of this Act.

     NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY

   </p>
   <p>
    This section is modified for clarification and to conform to the decision not to authorize multiple beneficiaries. See comments to G.S. 33B-6.

    This section permits a future custodial trustee to be designated to receive property for the beneficiary of a custodial trust to be effective upon the occurrence of a future event or transfer. To accommodate changes in circumstances during the passage of time, one or more successors or substitute custodial trustees can also be designated. The designation of the future custodial trustee and the beneficiary can be made in an instrument which is revocable or irrevocable depending upon the nature of the transaction or transfer. Any person designated as a future custodial trustee may decline to serve before the transfer occurs or may resign under Section 13 after the transfer.

    The source of this section is Section 3 of UTMA.
   </p>
   <p>
    The enacting state's rule against perpetuities may limit or affect the creation of a custodial trust upon the occurrence of a future event, but because the use of a custodial trust usually contemplates dispositions for the benefit of living persons, perpetuity problems should rarely arise.

     NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY

   </p>
   <p>
    The designation of a future custodial trustee under this section is revocable or irrevocable depending upon the nature of the transaction or transfer. For example, the designation of a future custodial trustee in a will ordinarily would be revocable until the death of the testator, because wills are freely revocable. On the other hand, the designation of a future custodial trustee in a deed ordinarily would become irrevocable upon delivery of the deed, because deeds usually are irrevocable.
   </p>
   <p>
    In order to avoid confusion between revocable and irrevocable transfers, this section is rewritten to list separately the types of transactions or transfers to which it applies. New subsection (a) deletes some ambiguous language about "property payable or transferable upon a future event . . ." in favor of a simpler concept of "a custodial trust to begin in the future." To aid in this restructuring, former subsection (c) is incorporated into new subsection (a).
   </p>
   <p>
    The list of transactions deletes the term "multiple party account" in favor of the term "payable-on-death account." The term "multiple party account" is a Uniform Probate Code term that has no statutory use in North Carolina. Further, certain types of multiple party accounts are not properly within the scope of this section; for example, a depositor's establishing a joint account between the depositor and a custodian would be a present transfer governed by G.S. 33B-2.
   </p>
   <p>
    The list of transactions adds the term "pension or profit sharing plan" as a specific example of payments pursuant to contract. This term appears also in G.S. 36A-6 (which exempts employee trusts from the Rule Against Perpetuities). The requirement of registration or delivery of the writing under subdivision (a)(7) is mentioned in this subdivision but not in others because the law applicable to the other kinds of transactions is well settled. This organization avoids an ambiguity in the Uniform Act as to whether the registration or delivery requirement applies to all kinds of transactions.
   </p>
   <p>
    The catchline of this section is changed from "Custodial trustee for future payment or delivery" to "Custodial trust to begin in the future" to clarify the concept of the section.

    Although a custodial trust is created by a transfer that satisfies Section 2 of the Act, the responsibility and obligations upon the trustee do not arise until the trustee has accepted the transfer. This detailed section is included to call the attention of the parties to the effective receipt and acceptance by the custodial trustee. Once a custodial trustee accepts the transfer of the custodial trust property, the custodial trustee assumes the obligation of a custodial trustee under this Act. The acceptance can be expressed or implied, but it is recommended that the written acceptance provided for in Section 4(b) be utilized. By the acceptance the custodial trustee submits to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the enacting state for the purpose of the custodial trust, despite subsequent relocation of the parties or of the custodial trust property. The principal sources of these provisions are Sections 8 and 9 of UTMA and the analogous provisions under the Uniform Probate Code, Sections 3-602, 5-208, 5-307, 7-103.

    This section is in the nature of a facility-of-payment provision that permits persons owing money to an incapacitated individual to discharge a fixed obligation by a payment to a custodial trustee under this Act. The section does not authorize the custodial trustee to settle claims for disputed amounts but only to acknowledge an effective receipt of property paid or delivered. It is based primarily on Sections 6 and 7 of UTMA and includes the protections of Section 8 of UTMA as well. It permits a custodial trust to be established as a substitute for a conservatorship to receive payments due an incapacitated individual. Also, see Section 11, which protects transferors and other third parties dealing with the custodial trustee.

    This Act, unlike UTMA, does not preclude a custodial trust for more than one beneficiary. Adult persons creating custodial trusts are likely to set up custodial trusts in various forms, e.g., parents may wish to set up a custodial trust for their children or for themselves, then for a spouse, etc. However, the interests of each beneficiary are separate and the custodial trustee is obligated under subsection (c) to account separately to each beneficiary for administration of the beneficiary's interest in the custodial trust.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subsection (b) allows a custodial trustee who is administering multiple custodial trusts for the same beneficiary to administer the custodial trusts as a single custodial trust. For example, if multiple trusts are created for an incapacitated beneficiary, the custodial trustee can administer them as a single custodial trust.

    This section is modified to eliminate references to multiple beneficiaries of a custodial trust. While there are benefits to allowing multiple beneficiaries, the complexities arising from joint beneficiaries raise questions that are unnecessary in light of the ease of creating more than one custodial trust. The drafters believed that allowing multiple beneficiaries and a right of survivorship in the custodial trust property would raise a host of questions that are inconsistent with the overall goal of a mechanically simple statutory trust, the main incidents of which are designed to be practicable.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under the provisions of G.S. 33B-17(a)(3)a. and b., a successor to the property following a termination of the custodial trust can be designated by either the creating instrument or a competent beneficiary. The drafters believed that no additional survivorship provisions are warranted.

    Subsection (b) restates and confirms the control by the beneficiary who is not incapacitated. However, the trustee has a reasonable obligation to act when the beneficiary has not directed him. Under Sections 9 and 10, when a beneficiary becomes incapacitated, the custodial trust becomes a discretionary trust and the trustee is subject to the control of the statute and not the beneficiary's direction. The custodial trustee is subject to the usual trustee's standard as taken from Section 7-302 of the Uniform Probate Code. The statute also imposes a slightly higher standard on professional fiduciaries acting under the statute. Otherwise, much of this section is taken from Section 12 of UTMA. Whenever recordable assets, such as land, are in the custodial trust, the trustee would be expected to record title to the asset. The section is entitled "general duties" because there are additional specific duties identified in other sections such as Section 9.

    This section provides that the custodial trustee is obligated to follow the directions of the beneficiary who is not incapacitated in paying over or expending custodial trust property. If the beneficiary is incapacitated, this section imposes duties on the custodial trustee to apply funds for the beneficiary similar to those imposed on custodians for minors under Section 14 of UTMA. In addition, however, subsection (b) authorizes a custodial trustee to pay over or expend custodial trust property for the use and benefit of the incapacitated beneficiary's dependents who were supported by the beneficiary at the time the beneficiary became incapacitated or for whom there is a legal obligation to support.
   </p>
   <p>
    The use-and-benefits standard for the expenditure of custodial property is intended to avoid any implication that the custodial trust property can be used only for the required support of the incapacitated beneficiary.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subsection (c) allows a custodial trustee to maintain a bank account, of an amount reasonable under the circumstances, with the beneficiary whereby both the beneficiary and the custodial trustee may write checks on the account. This may be used as one method of making money available for the beneficiary's personal needs. Many incapacitated persons, unable to manage business affairs, are still competent to pay personal expenses. This type of arrangement would be important to them. A custodial trustee should maintain, of course, a separate bank account for use in managing the custodial trust property and investments.

    An alternative approach might be taken to this section that refers to the distributive powers of a conservator under the laws of the enacting state, in the event that state should prefer that incorporation by reference.

    The drafters were concerned with the broad discretion provided by this section to the custodial trustee when the beneficiary is incompetent. The concern focused on the provisions of subsection (b) stating that the custodial trustee may expend so much of the custodial trust property as the custodial trustee "considers advisable" and may do so "in the manner, when, and to the extent that the custodial trustee determines suitable and proper." There was also concern with the indefiniteness of the phrase "individuals who were supported by the beneficiary," which appears in the Uniform Act. The words "the spouse and children, and other dependents of the beneficiary" are substituted for the words "individuals who were supported by the beneficiary when the beneficiary became incapacitated, or who are legally entitled to support by the beneficiary." The drafters thought it would rarely be desirable to have the custodial trust property used for a person who did not fall within the substituted language (which has been taken from G.S. 32A-2(a) relating to durable powers of attorney). Also, by limiting the custodial trustee's discretion regarding which individuals may receive the custodial trust property, the concerns over the broad discretion granted to the custodial trustee in the administration of the custodial trust are lessened.

    This is one of the more important sections of the Act under which the custodial trustee may determine that the beneficiary is incapacitated so the trust will change from one subject to the control of the beneficiary to a discretionary trust for the beneficiary. Subsection (b) allows the custodial trustee to determine that the beneficiary is incapacitated provided the determination is based upon the certificate of the beneficiary's physician, the prior direction or authority of the beneficiary, or other reasonable evidence. That authority could be evidenced, for example, by a durable power of attorney executed by the beneficiary prior to becoming incapacitated even though that power of attorney is not otherwise effective to control management or termination of the custodial trust. Such a durable power of attorney could be given to a child, spouse, friend, or other trusted individual. In addition, specific authority is provided in subsection (d) for the beneficiary, the custodial trustee, or other interested person to seek a declaration from the court as to the capacity of the beneficiary for the purposes of this Act. This is important to the custodial trustee, as his duties and responsibilities change on the event of the beneficiary's incapacity.
   </p>
   <p>
    This section is not a proceeding for the appointment of a conservator, and it is not contemplated that such a declaration would lead to court appointment of a conservator or guardian unless other factors would warrant such appointment. The existence of a comprehensive and well-managed custodial trust would be one factor that would tend to avoid the necessity for the appointment of a conservator or guardian of the estate.
   </p>
   <p>
    This section also does not provide a proceeding to attack the legal competence of a transferor in setting up a trust under Section 2. Rather, Section 10 relates to a management matter in a validly established custodial trust.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subsection (f) provides that the incapacity of the beneficiary does not terminate the custodial trust. If the beneficiary becomes incapacitated, the authority of the custodial trustee continues and the custodial trustee must follow the statutory provisions of the Act relating to managing custodial trusts for incapacitated individuals.

    Subdivision (a)(iii) is added to permit a custodial trustee to administer the custodial trust as for an incapacitated beneficiary if a determination of incompetency has been made under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, including a determination of limited incompetence under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html#t35As0Ia01s35A-1112ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 35A-1112(d)</a></cite>. For clarification, a reference to subsection (b) is inserted in subdivision (a)(iv), thereby eliminating any interpretation that subdivision (a)(iv) provides additional independent authority for a custodial trustee to make a determination of incapacity. Subdivision (b)(iii) is added to permit a custodial trustee to determine that the beneficiary is incapacitated in reliance upon authority given to the custodial trustee in the instrument creating the custodial trust. In subdivision (b)(iv), "reasonable" is substituted for "persuasive" because "reasonable" has more object connotation. Subsection (c) is modified by substituting "determines" for "reasonably concludes" to conform the language of the subsection to the language of the new subsection (f). Subsection (d) is modified to clarify that when the petition for a determination of incapacity is filed under the provisions of subsection (d), the procedures of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> regarding the determination of incompetency are to be used, but that the substantive criteria set out in the definition of "incapacitated" contain in G.S. 33B-1(8) are the criteria to be used in the proceedings. Subsection (e) of the Uniform Act is deleted because the drafters believed that the subsection would be interpreted as expanding the authority of the custodial trustee under subsection (b) to determine that the beneficiary is incapacitated in reliance upon other reasonable evidence. The drafters believed that subsection (e) would expose the custodial trustee to liability to a greater degree than subsection (a) or (b) and that subsection (e) would in effect defeat what the drafters tried to accomplish in modifying subsections (a) and (b). Subsection (f) has no counterpart in the Uniform Act and states what is believed to be implicit in the Uniform Act.

    This section is patterned after Section 17 of the UTMA and that section in turn was based upon Sections 5-428 and 7-306 of the Uniform Probate Code limiting the liability of conservators and trustees. See also Restatement of Trusts, 2d Sections 265 and 277. The effect of this section is to limit the claims of third parties to recourse against custodial trust property as both the custodial trustee and the beneficiary are protected from personal liability absent personal fault on their part. This section does not alter the obligations between the custodial trustee and the beneficiary arising out of the administration of the estate and the accounting for that administration.
   </p>
   <p>
    There may be cases in which a custodial trustee or beneficiary may have a right to possession of custodial trust property and may insure against liability arising out of possession or control of the property as a named insured, e.g., under homeowner's or automobile liability insurance. In such a case, the beneficiary should be permitted as a party defendant under subsection (d) but only to the extent of the protection of the liability insurance.

   <p>
    This section follows many of the provisions of Section 18 of UTMA with some substantive changes. It is designed to accommodate in a single section the circumstances in which a custodial trustee would be replaced by another custodial trustee. Under subsection (b), if the beneficiary is incapacitated, a custodial trustee who resigns must give written notice to both the beneficiary and the beneficiary's conservator if one exists. Under subsection (c), a beneficiary who is not incapacitated may designate, without limitation, a successor custodial trustee. If, however, the beneficiary fails to act or is incapacitated, the procedure to be followed is very similar to that found in UTMA except that the nonincapacitated beneficiary has 90 days to act and if the beneficiary has no conservator or if the conservator declines to act, the custodial trustee may eventually designate a successor custodial trustee.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under subsection (f), the beneficiary, whether or not incapacitated, can petition the court to remove the custodial trustee for cause and to designate a successor trustee, or the court may require the custodial trustee to give bond or other appropriate relief.
   </p>
   <p>
    This section, unlike Section 18 of UTMA, does not give the custodial trustee the general power to designate a successor custodial trustee but rather limits that power to the situation in which the procedure for designating successor custodial trustees by others has been exhausted.

    This section follows the pattern of Section 15 of the UTMA except it does subject the arrangements for payment of expenses, compensation, and bond to provisions in the custodial trust instrument or agreement of the beneficiary or court order.
   </p>
   <p>
    As in UTMA, the provisions with regard to compensation are designed to avoid imputed compensation to the custodian who waives compensation and also to avoid the accumulation of claims for compensation until the termination of the custodial trust. Although the ability to control these matters by the trust instrument or agreement of the beneficiary seems to be implied, as was assumed in UTMA, it is here expressly stated because of the possibility of informal arrangements with persons as trustees.

    This section requires that the custodial trustee inform the beneficiary of the initiation of the trust and provide reasonably current reports of the administration of the custodial trust to the beneficiary or the beneficiary's legal representative. Even though some custodial trustees may act informally, it seems appropriate that both the trustee and the beneficiary be expected to exchange complete information concerning the administration of the trust at least once each year. In some cases, more frequent exchanges of information between the custodial trustee and beneficiary would be expected, e.g., when they use a bank account to which both have access. This is particularly true with regard to necessary information for tax reporting by the parties involved. This section assumes the usual minimum components of an account, i.e., assets and values at the beginning of the accounting period, receipts, and disbursements during the accounting period and assets and their values on hand or available for distribution at the close of the accounting period.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subsection (a) identifies the necessary reports and accountings for the parties, and subsection (b) identifies a broad group of persons who may petition the court for an accounting by the custodial trustee or the custodial trustee's legal representative. Much of the section is drawn from Section 19 of the UTMA modified to fit the custodial trust. Subsection (f) recognizes the inherent power of the court to instruct trustees and review their actions. This paragraph is patterned after Uniform Probate Code Section 7-205.

   <p>
    In an effort to provide as comprehensive a statute as possible to inform the parties of substantially all of their obligations and rights, statutes of limitation are provided in this section. The limitations provided in this section are derived from the Uniform Probate Code, Sections 1-106 and 7-307, and from the Missouri Custodial Act.
   </p>
   <p>
    The nature of the limitations imposed by the section are illustrated by the situation in which a custodial trustee is removed, resigns, or dies. If the former custodial trustee accounts as required under Section 13 on removal or resignation, or the deceased custodial trustee's personal representative accounts, the two-year limitation of subsection (a)(1) applies. Should the former custodial trustee or the personal representative fail to account, then, subsection (a)(2) would apply to limit the time in which a proceeding to assert the claim could be commenced. This time would begin to run on the date the trust terminated. Of course, if the claim is one for fraud or concealment, the longer time limitation of subsection (b) would apply. In any event, should the beneficiary become incapacitated or die before the applicable time limitation had expired, the tolling provision of subsection (c) could postpone the time bar until two years after removal of the disability or death.

The language "if the claim was not barred by adjudication, consent, or limitation prior to the claimant's death" is inserted in subdivision (c)(3) to eliminate the possibility that the subdivision might be interpreted to revive a claim barred prior to the death of the claimant.

   <p>
    This section controls distribution of the custodial trust property when the custodial trust is terminated under Section 2(e). It is designed to provide for efficient and certain distribution without judicial proceedings. Subsection (a)(3) is an important provision for avoiding complications on distribution and provides that distribution may be controlled first, by the direction of the deceased beneficiary or second, by the custodial trust instrument (see Sections 2, 6 and 18) and, only if no effective prior designation for the payment or distribution of the property on the death of the beneficiary has been made, shall it pass through the beneficiary's estate.
   </p>
   <p>
    The direction to the custodial trustee by the beneficiary, who is not incapacitated, for distribution on termination of the custodial trust may be in any written form clearly identifying the distributee. For example, the following direction would be adequate under the statute:
   </p>
   <p>
    I, ________ (name of beneficiary) hereby direct ______________ (name of trustee) as custodial trustee, to transfer and pay the unexpended balance of the custodial trust property of which I am beneficiary to ________ as distributee on the termination of the trust at my death. In the event of the prior death of ________ above named as distributee, I designate ________ as distributee of the custodial trust property.

    Subdivision (a)(3)(ii) of the Uniform Act, relating to the concept of multiple beneficiaries, is deleted.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subsection (d), which has no counterpart in the Uniform Act, was added by the General Assembly to require a writing or instrument designating someone other than the beneficiary's estate to receive the custodial trust property at the beneficiary's death (i) to be signed by at least two witnesses, neither of whom is the custodial trustee or the distributee of the custodial trust property and (ii) to be acknowledged by the beneficiary or transferor before an individual authorized to administer oaths or take acknowledgments. These requirements apply only where someone other than the beneficiary's estate is designated to receive the custodial trust property at the beneficiary's death.

    (6) Irrevocable exercise of a power of appointment, pursuant to its terms, in favor of a trust company, an adult other than the donee of the power, or the donee who holds the power if the beneficiary is other than the donee, designated in the appointment in substance "as custodial trustee for ______________ (name of beneficiary) under the North Carolina Uniform Custodial Trust Act";
    (7) Delivery of a written notification or assignment of a right to future payment under a contract to an obligor which transfers the right under the contract to a trust company, an adult other than the transferor, or the transferor if the beneficiary is other than the transferor, designated in the notification or assignment in substance "as custodial trustee for ______________ (name of beneficiary) under the North Carolina Uniform Custodial Trust Act";

    This section largely follows Section 9 of UTMA. It provides instructional detail for forms and methods of transferring assets that satisfy the requirements of the statute. Although many of the customary methods of transferring assets are identified, these methods are not intended to be exclusive since any type of property that can be transferred by any legal means is intended to be within the scope of the statute, provided the requirements of Section 2 are met. The method of transfer or conveyance appropriate to the asset should be used, e.g., if land is involved, a deed or conveyance that satisfies the local requirements would be appropriate. In the effort to make the statute as self-contained and as fully explanatory as possible, these provisions for implementation are included in the statute rather than being appended or inserted in the Comments.

     NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY

   <p>
    The forms in subsection (a) were modified by the General Assembly to conform to the witness and acknowledgment requirements of G.S. 33B-17(d). The witness and acknowledgment provisions in the forms are necessary only where someone other than the beneficiary's estate is designated to receive the custodial trust property at the beneficiary's death. As provided in G.S. 33B-17(d), failure to comply with the witness or acknowledge requirement shall not affect the validity of the custodial trust during the life of the beneficiary.
   </p>
   <p>
    The phrase ", but not limited to," is inserted in the introductory language to subsection (b) to clarify that the list of methods of transferring property is illustrative and nonexclusive. Clarifying stylistic changes are made to the Uniform Act's language in subdivisions (b)(5), (6) and (7) by changing "whose name in the assignment is designated," "whose name in the appointment is designated," and "whose name in the notification or assignment is designated" to "designated in the assignment," "designated in the appointment," and "designated in the notification or assignment," respectively. Subdivision (b)(8) is modified by deleting the reference to recordation because recordation (as opposed to delivery of the deed) generally is technically unnecessary for the validity of a conveyance or transfer of an interest in real property in North Carolina. G.S. 47-26 however requires deeds of gift, which would include deeds of gift to a custodial trustee, to be recorded within two years; therefore, under most circumstances the custodial trustee has a duty to record the deed. A change similar to the change made in subdivision (b)(8) was made in the North Carolina Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.
