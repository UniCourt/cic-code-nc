            The Governor of North Carolina is hereby authorized to appoint two competent commissioners and a surveyor and a sufficient number of chainbearers, on the part of the State of North Carolina, to act with the commissioners or surveyors appointed or to be
            appointed by any of the contiguous states of Virginia, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia, to return and remark, by some permanent monuments at convenient intervals, not greater than five miles, the boundary lines between this State and
            any of the said states.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Governor is also authorized, whenever in his judgment it shall be deemed necessary to protect or establish the boundary lines between this State and any other state, to institute and prosecute in the name of the State of North Carolina any and all
            such actions, suits, or proceedings at law or in equity, and to direct the Attorney General or such other person as he may designate to conduct and prosecute such actions, suits, or proceedings.

     Line Between North Carolina and Tennessee.
    </b> - Under the Acts of 1821 of the States of North Carolina and Tennessee confirming the boundary line between the two states "as run and marked" by the joint commission, when it is clearly shown where the line between two known points
            but a few miles apart was run and marked by the commission, such line must be accepted by the courts, in a suit between private persons, as the true and ancient boundary, even though it now appears that a different line between such points
            might more accurately conform to a general call in the act of cession for "the extreme height" of a certain mountain for a distance of 100 miles. Stevenson v. Fain, 116 F. 147 (6th Cir. 1902), appeal dismissed, 195 U.S. 165, 25 S. Ct. 6, 49

     Ambulatory Seaward Boundary Consistent with Constitution.

            <span class="s1">
     §

            erosion, accretion or fill deposition, would be consistent with the constitution and not require amendment of this section; a reading of the State constitutional provision together with this section and the case law reveal them to require
            that the eastern boundary always remain at a distance of three geographical miles from the extreme low water mark (ELWM). See opinion of Attorney General to Gary W. Thompson, Chief, North Carolina Geodetic Survey, 1998 N.C.A.G. 7 (2/11/98).
