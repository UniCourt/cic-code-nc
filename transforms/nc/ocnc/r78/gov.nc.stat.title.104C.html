    Editor's Note.
   
   - This Chapter was rewritten by Session Laws 1975, c. 718, s. 1, effective July 1, 1975, and has been recodified as <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.104E.html" target="_blank">Chapter 104E</a></cite>. Session Laws 1975, c. 718, s. 8, had provided that s. 1 of the act would expire June 30, 1981. However, Session Laws 1975, c. 718, s. 8, was amended by Session Laws 1981, c. 393, so as to delete the provision for expiration of the act.
