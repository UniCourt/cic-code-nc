       § 53-159.1. Power of fiduciary or custodian to deposit securities in a clearing corporation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any fiduciary holding securities in its fiduciary capacity, any trust institution holding securities in a fiduciary capacity or as a custodian or agent is authorized to deposit or arrange for the deposit of such securities with a securities intermediary as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.025.html#t25a08s25-8-102" target="_blank">G.S. 25-8-102</a></cite>. When such securities are so deposited, certificates representing securities of the same class of the same issuer may be merged and held in bulk in the name of the nominee of such securities intermediary with any other such securities deposited in such securities intermediary by any person regardless of the ownership of such securities, and certificates of small denomination may be merged into one or more certificates of larger denomination. The records of such fiduciary and the records of such trust institution acting as a fiduciary or as a custodian or managing agent shall at all times show the name of the party for whose account the securities are so deposited. Title to such securities may be transferred by bookkeeping entry on the books of such securities intermediary without physical delivery of certificates representing such securities. A trust institution so depositing securities pursuant to this section shall be subject to such rules as, in the case of State-chartered institutions, the State Banking Commission and, in the case of other institutions, their regulators may from time to time issue. A trust institution acting as custodian or agent for a fiduciary shall, on demand by the fiduciary, certify in writing to the fiduciary the securities so deposited by such

A fiduciary shall, on demand by any party to a judicial proceeding for the settlement of such fiduciary's account or on demand by the attorney for such party, certify in writing to such party the securities deposited by such fiduciary in such securities intermediary for its account as such fiduciary. This section shall apply to any fiduciary holding securities in its fiduciary capacity, and to any trust institution holding securities as a fiduciary or as a custodian or managing agent acting on May 15, 1973, or who thereafter may act regardless of the date of the agreement, instrument or court order by which it is appointed and regardless of whether or not such fiduciary, custodian or agent owns capital stock of such securities intermediary. The fiduciary shall personally be liable for any loss to the trust resulting from an act of such nominee in connection with such securities so deposited.

       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 2006-243, s. 1, provides "The General Assembly makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Consumer loans in North Carolina are regulated by the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act, Article 15 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.053.html" target="_blank">Chapter 53</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The North Carolina Consumer Finance Act requires consumer finance lenders to be licensed and, under G.S. 53-173, authorizes interest rates of up to thirty-six percent (36%) on loans of three thousand dollars ($3,000) or less.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Some lenders have attempted to evade the restrictions of the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act by offering cash advances in the form of instant cash rebates or other guises. These cash advance transactions are typically offered in conjunction with the sale of Internet access, telephone time units, catalog certificates, or the use of office equipment, when in fact the sale of the goods or services is a pretext for the making of a loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) North Carolina courts have declared some of these transactions to be unlawful, but new schemes continue to be devised in order to circumvent the lending laws of North Carolina and to avoid regulation by the Commissioner of Banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) It is the intent of the General Assembly that G.S. 53-166(a) should be construed broadly to prohibit illicit lending schemes and to clarify the devices, subterfuges, and pretenses that are prohibited under G.S. 53-166(b), as amended by Section 2 of this act."
     </p>
     <p>
      This section, as amended by Session Laws 2006-243, s. 2, effective October 1, 2006, is applicable to transactions that are investigated on or after that date under the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act, Article 15 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.053.html" target="_blank">Chapter 53</a></cite> of the General Statutes, and to transactions that are subject to enforcement actions under the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act that are filed on or after that date.

     <p>
      Effect of Amendments.
   
   - Session Laws 2006-243, s. 2, effective October 1, 2006, and applicable to transactions that are investigated on or after that date under the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act, Article 15 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.053.html" target="_blank">Chapter 53</a></cite> of the General Statutes, and to transactions that are subject to enforcement actions under the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act that are filed on or after that date, rewrote the section.

       Construed With Mortgage Lending Act.
   
   - Had the General Assembly intended to impose the same penalty for violations of the Mortgage Lending Act (MLA) that it did in the Consumer Financing Act, namely, voiding of the transaction under G.S. 53-166(d), it could have included language in the MLA leading to the same result. Instead, in G.S. 53-243.12(j) [repealed; see now G.S. 53-244.116], the MLA provided a limited remedy. In re Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust Executed by Bradburn, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C.

       Deterring Presentment of a Check.
   
   - The Consumer Finance Act applies to a check cashing company which cashes a check, and for a fee, agrees to defer presentment of the check until sufficient funds are deposited into the customer's bank account to cover the amount of the check, if the amount of the loan is $10,000 or less and if the fee charged by the company exceeds the charges permitted under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.024.html" target="_blank">Chapter 24</a></cite>. In this event, the company will be subject to all provisions of the Act, including the penal provisions of subsection (c) of this section. It also appears that these transactions violate G.S. 14-107, and may violate Truth-in-Lending requirements regarding disclosure. See opinion of the Attorney General to Mr. George J. Franks, Attorney at Law, Cumberland County Sheriff's Office, Fayetteville, 60 N.C.A.G. 86 (1992).

        Editor's Note.
       </b>
       - Session Laws 2006-243, s. 1, provides "The General Assembly makes the following findings:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) Consumer loans in North Carolina are regulated by the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act, Article 15 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.053.html" target="_blank">Chapter 53</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The North Carolina Consumer Finance Act requires consumer finance lenders to be licensed and, under G.S. 53-173, authorizes interest rates of up to thirty-six percent (36%) on loans of three thousand dollars ($3,000) or less.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) Some lenders have attempted to evade the restrictions of the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act by offering cash advances in the form of instant cash rebates or other guises. These cash advance transactions are typically offered in conjunction with the sale of Internet access, telephone time units, catalog certificates, or the use of office equipment, when in fact the sale of the goods or services is a pretext for the making of a loan.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) North Carolina courts have declared some of these transactions to be unlawful, but new schemes continue to be devised in order to circumvent the lending laws of North Carolina and to avoid regulation by the Commissioner of Banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4) It is the intent of the General Assembly that G.S. 53-166(a) should be construed broadly to prohibit illicit lending schemes and to clarify the devices, subterfuges, and pretenses that are prohibited under G.S. 53-166(b), as amended by Section 2 of this act."

       This section, as amended by Session Laws 2006-243, s. 2, effective October 1, 2006, is applicable to transactions that are investigated on or after that date under the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act, Article 15 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.053.html" target="_blank">Chapter 53</a></cite> of the General Statutes, and to transactions that are subject to enforcement actions under the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act that are filed on or after that date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Session Laws 2021-84, s. 12, made the amendments to this section by Session Laws 2021-84, s. 1, effective December 1, 2021, and applicable to offenses committed on or after that date. Session Laws 2021-84, s. 12, further provides: "Prosecutions for offenses committed before the effective date of this act are not abated or affected by this act, and the statutes that would be applicable but for this act remain applicable to those prosecutions."

     <p>
      For the purpose of defraying necessary expenses of the Office of Commissioner of Banks for supervision, each licensee shall pay to the Commissioner an assessment not to exceed eighteen dollars ($18.00) per one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of assets, or fraction thereof, plus a fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00) per office; provided, however, a consumer finance licensee shall pay a minimum annual assessment of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00). The assessment shall be determined on a consumer finance licensee's total assets as shown on its report of condition made to the Commissioner as of December 31 of each year, or the date most nearly approximating that date. If the Commissioner determines that the financial condition or manner of operation of a consumer finance licensee warrants further examination or an increased level of supervision, the licensee may be subject to assessment not to exceed the amount determined in accordance with the schedule set forth in this section.

       Time and Payment Limitation. - Every loan contract shall provide for repayment of the amount loaned in substantially equal installments, either of principal or of principal and charges in the aggregate, at approximately equal periodic intervals of time. Nothing contained herein shall prevent a loan being considered a new loan because the proceeds of the loan are used to pay an existing contract.

      <li id="t53a15s53-180ol1b">
       No Assignment of Earnings. - A licensee may not take an assignment of earnings of the borrower for payment or as security for payment of a loan. An assignment of earnings in violation of this section is unenforceable by the assignee of the earnings and is revocable by the borrower. A sale of unpaid earnings made in consideration of the payment of money to or for the account of the seller of the earnings is deemed to be a loan to the seller by an assignment of earnings.

       Prohibitions on Discrimination. - No licensee shall deny any extension of credit or discriminate in the fixing of the amount, duration, application procedures or other terms or conditions of such extension of credit because of the race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status of the applicant or any other person connected with the transaction.

      <li id="t53a15s53-180ol1h">
       Limitations on Home Loans. - No affiliate operating in the same office or subsidiary operating in the same office of a licensee shall make any home loan as defined in G.S. 24-1.1A(e) in a principal amount of less than three thousand dollars ($3,000).

        <li id="t53a15s53-180.1ol1b1">
         The licensee notifies the borrower's commanding officer or executive officer before the loan is consummated.

        Federal Preemption.
       </b>
       - Bankruptcy court held that the disputed issues of fact regarding tracing were immaterial, and that summary judgment was appropriate because the former North Carolina Money Transmitters Act (NCMTA), former G.S. 53-208.1 et seq., eliminated the need for a tracing analysis by creating a floating trust; however, the North Carolina legislature could not alter a federal tracing requirement. Even if the NCMTA established a floating trust as the bankruptcy court held, the floating nature of the trust conflicted with federal law and was preempted. Callaway v. Memo Money Order Co., 381 B.R. 650 (E.D.N.C. 2008).

       The surety bond amount required subsequent to initial licensure shall consist of a base amount of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) for money transmission volumes in this State of no more than one million dollars ($1,000,000). However, if a licensee has transmission volume in North Carolina in a 12-month period ending December 31 in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000) but less than five million dollars ($5,000,000), then the licensee's bond amount shall be one hundred seventy five thousand dollars ($175,000); if a licensee has transmission volume in North Carolina in a 12-month period ending December 31 in excess of five million dollars ($5,000,000) but less than ten million dollars ($10,000,000), then the licensee's bond amount shall be two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000); if a licensee has transmission volume in North Carolina in a 12-month period ending December 31 in excess of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) but less than fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), then the licensee's bond amount shall be two hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($225,000); and if a licensee has transmission volume in North Carolina in a 12-month period ending December 31 in excess of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), then the licensee's bond amount shall be two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).

      Upon a finding that any action of an international banking corporation or its international banking agency, international banking branch, or international representative office subject to this Article may be in violation of any North Carolina banking law, the Commissioner, after a reasonable notice to the international banking corporation, international bank agency, international bank branch, or international representative office and an opportunity for it to be heard, may order it to cease and desist from the action.

       Jurisdiction.
   
   - Wisconsin limited liability companies' (LLCs') actions of registering as a mortgage banker in North Carolina and accepting payments on loans it sold to a bank from the bank's North Carolina offices were sufficient to satisfy the due process requirement for minimum contacts in North Carolina, and the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying the LLCs' motion to dismiss the bank's action for lack of personal jurisdiction. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Bankers Wholesale Mortg., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 570 S.E.2d 217 (2002).

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of Application Upheld.
   
   - North Carolina State Banking Commission's decision denying the applications for licensure for two mortgage loan officers was upheld on appeal and the lower court did not err by relying upon a previously entered default judgment against the two since the applicants' prior mortgage company had been awarded that default judgment for engaging in a pattern of business operations regarding false and misleading representations and they were not exempt from the qualifications of G.S. 53-243.05 (see now 53-244.050) pursuant to a grandfather provision, because that grandfather provision only exempted already licensed persons from taking the three-year training requirement.

   - Had the General Assembly intended to impose the same penalty for violations of the Mortgage Lending Act (MLA) that it did in the Consumer Financing Act, namely, voiding of the transaction under G.S. 53-166(d), it could have included language in the MLA leading to the same result. Instead, in G.S. 53-243.12(j) [now repealed], the MLA provided a limited remedy. In re Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust Executed by Bradburn, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the General Assembly that reverse mortgage loans be available so that elderly homeowners may use the equity in their homes to meet their financial needs.
   The General Assembly recognizes that there may be restrictions and requirements governing traditional mortgage transactions that should not apply to reverse mortgages.
   The purpose of this Article is to authorize reverse mortgage transactions and to clarify other provisions of North Carolina law that might otherwise apply to reverse mortgage loans, and to provide protection for elderly homeowners who enter into reverse mortgage transactions.

   A reverse mortgage loan contract shall state that if a borrower fails to pay property taxes, insurance premiums, or assessments, the lender may choose, at the lender's option, to pay the amounts due, charge them to the reverse mortgage loan, and recalculate regularly scheduled payments under the loan to account for the increased outstanding loan balance.

Affidavit of the mailing of the notice herein required and of the newspaper as to the publication shall be conclusive evidence of notice hereunder. At the meeting, any shareholders may be represented by proxy and the shareholders shall elect, by a majority vote of the shares present, an agent or agents who shall be authorized to receive from the Commissioner all the remaining assets of the State trust company. The shareholders also may specify the means of resolving disputes between multiple agents and appointing successors to the agent or agents. The Commissioner shall cause to be transferred and delivered to the agent, or agents, all the remaining assets of the State trust company. The Commissioner shall thereupon cause to be filed in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the action is pending a full and complete report of all transactions showing the assets of the State trust company so transferred together with the name of the agent or agents giving receipt for the assets; and the filing of the report shall act as a full and complete discharge of the Commissioner from all further liabilities to the shareholders of the State trust company by reason of the liquidation of the State trust company. The agent shall convert the assets coming into the agent's hands into cash, except as otherwise provided by the court upon motion in the cause made by a shareholder of the State trust company, and shall make distribution to the shareholders of the State trust company as herein provided. The agent shall file semiannually a report of all transactions with the superior court of the county in which the State trust company is located, and with the Commissioner, and shall be allowed for the services such fees, not in excess of five percent (5%) of receipts and disbursements, as may be fixed by the court. In case of death, removal, or refusal to act of any agent or agents elected by the shareholders, the Commissioner or any interested person may seek an order from the resident or presiding judge in the county in which the action is pending appointing a successor to the agent or agents as determined by the shareholders or, if no method was set forth by the shareholders, as determined by the court to be in the best interests of the shareholders. The court in its discretion may either appoint a successor or order the call of a further meeting of shareholders for the election of a successor and make any orders that are appropriate.

The conservator, under the direction of the Commissioner, shall take possession of the fiduciary records and other books, records, and assets of every description of the State trust company placed under conservatorship and take actions necessary to conserve those assets pending further disposition of its business as provided by law. Except as provided in G.S. 53-405, the conservator shall have all rights, powers, and privileges, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, now possessed by or given to the Commissioner under the provisions of Subpart B and Subpart D of this Part.
