        </p>
        <p>
            The "common law" to be applied in North Carolina is the common law of England to the extent it was in force and use within this State at the time of the Declaration of Independence; is not otherwise contrary to the independence of this State or the form
            of government established therefor; and is not abrogated, repealed, or obsolete. Gwathmey v. State ex rel. Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 287</cite>, 464 S.E.2d 674 (1995); Conley
            v. Emerald Isle Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 293</cite>, 513 S.E.2d 556 (1999).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court properly denied a defendant's motion to refer the matter to a three-judge panel because he did not show that exclusive jurisdiction was vested in a three-judge panel or that the deprivation of a substantial right would potentially work injury
            to him if not corrected before an appeal from a final judgment where, while common law torts were statutorily codified, the plaintiff's claims - alienation of affection and criminal conversation - did not arise under acts of the General Assembly,
            but were torts arising under common law, the trial court did not certify the order for appeal, and the defendant's motion alleged no specific basis, only the facial unconstitutionality of the torts. Estes v. Battiston, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d
            - (Oct. 20, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
            Extent to Which Common Law May Be Modified. - So much of the common law as is in force by virtue of this section may be modified or repealed, but those parts of the common law which are imbedded in the Constitution are not subject to control. State v.
            Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 439</cite>, 163 S.E. 581 (1932).
            <br />

        <p>
            <b>
     Effect of Legislation with Respect to Subject Matter of Common-Law Rule.
    </b> - Where the North Carolina General Assembly has legislated with respect to the subject matter of a common-law rule, the statute supplants the common law with respect to the particular rule, but so much of the common law as has not
            been abrogated or repealed by statute is in full force and effect. Allen v. Standard Crankshaft &amp; Hydraulic Co., 210 F. Supp. 844 (W.D.N.C. 1962), aff'd, 323 F.2d 29 (4th Cir. 1963).
        </p>
        <p>
            When the General Assembly legislates in respect to the subject matter of a common law rule, the statute supplants the common law rule in regard to that matter. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 269, 477 S.E.2d 182
            (1996), cert. denied and appeal denied, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 644</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 714 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 588</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 819 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1111, 119 S. Ct. 883, 142 L. Ed. 2d 783
            (1999).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Statutes Construed According to Common-Law Definition. - When a statute punishes an act, giving it a name known to the common law without otherwise defining it, the statute is construed according to the common-law definition. State v. Ingland,
            <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 42</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 577 (1971); State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 265</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 396 (1974).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Presumption as to Common Law in Sister States. - Where there is no evidence to the contrary, the presumption is that the common law is in force in a sister state. Hipps v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 472</cite>, 99 S.E. 335
            (1919).

            Because the historical purposes underlying the separation exception to the necessaries doctrine are incompatible with current mores and laws governing modern marital relationships in North Carolina, the separation exception as previously applied in the
            courts is "obsolete" within the meaning of this section. Being obsolete, that exception has no place in the common law and must be modified. Forsyth Mem. Hosp. v. Chisholm, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 616</cite>, 467 S.E.2d

            Obligation of Father to Support Child. - At common law it is the duty of a father to support his minor children. The common-law obligation of a father to support his child is not a debt in the legal sense, but an obligation imposed by law. It is not a
            property right of the child, but is a personal duty of the father, which is terminated by his death. These common-law principles have not been abrogated or modified by statute and are in full force and effect in this jurisdiction. Mullen v.

     Common Law Fraud.
    </b> - Because plaintiff's legal fees and other costs were not recoverable as independent damages on a fraud claim, and he did not allege that he suffered any other damage, he failed to prove that he suffered legally cognizable damages
            as a result of a misrepresentation by defendant. Under North Carolina law, a successful litigant could not recover attorneys' fees, whether as costs or as an item of damages, unless such a recovery was expressly authorized by statute, and
            costs were recoverable only in certain listed types of cases, none of which applied, or at the discretion of the court to a prevailing party, which necessarily meant establishing a prima facie case that, in the context of fraud, had to include
            independent damages aside from costs. Hoch v. Hoch (In re Hoch), - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Jan. 25, 2018).

            The failure of G.S. 14-39, prior to its 1975 amendment, to define kidnapping did not render the statute vague or uncertain, and the common-law definition of the offense was incorporated into the statute by construction. State v. Ingland,

            Common law attempted murder was not abrogated by G.S. 14-32(a), prohibiting assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, because while a person could attempt to murder another person by assaulting that person, with the intent
            to kill, using a deadly weapon and thereby inflict serious injury, a person did not have to do so to commit attempted murder, and attempted murder could occur through a multitude of circumstances, requiring simply (1) intent to kill and (2)
            an overt act which was more than mere preparation and committed with malice, premeditation, and deliberation. State v. Ramirez, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 576 S.E.2d 714 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 255</cite>,

            Barratry. - The common-law offense of barratry obtains in this State, since it has never been the subject of legislation in North Carolina and is not repugnant to nor inconsistent with our form of government. State v. Batson, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 411</cite>,

            49 S.E.2d 749 (1948), it does not appear that authority for the issuance of the writ, long recognized as an available common-law writ, was derived from the supervisory powers granted in the Constitution, but rather from this section, which,
            with certain exceptions, adopted the common law as the law of this State. Dantzic v. State, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 212</cite>, 182 S.E.2d 563, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 619</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 113 (1971).

            Forfeiture for felony, which was the established rule at common law, has had no force in this State since 1778. White v. Fort, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. 251</cite> (1824).
