                        <p>
                            Various Statutes Harmonized. - While the various statutes for the drainage of swamplands in eastern North Carolina have not the same provisions in all respects, they have been collected and are to be found in this Chapter, and should be construed to harmonize,
                            and constitute, with such variations, a system of drainage laws for the State. Adams v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 77</cite>, 60 S.E. 725 (1908); Sawyer Canal Co. v. Keys, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 360</cite>,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Foundation of Right to Condemn. - The right of the State to condemn land for drains rests on the same foundation as its right in cases of public roads, mills, railroads, schoolhouses, etc. Norfleet v. Cromwell, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. 634</cite>                            (1874).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The right to drain through the banks of a natural watercourse is exactly similar in character to the right to construct dykes or levees to keep their excessive waters from overflowing the adjacent lands, a right which has been recognized in the legislation
                            of all countries from the most ancient times. Sanderlin v. Luken, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 738</cite>, 68 S.E. 225 (1910).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Flexible Procedure Provided. - The statutes authorizing the creation, maintenance and improvements of drainage districts provide flexible procedure which may be modified and molded by decrees from time to time to promote the beneficial objects sought
                            by the creation of the district, subject to the restrictions that there should be no material change nor any change that would impose additional costs upon landowners except to the extent of benefits to them. In re Lyon Swamp
                            Drainage &amp; Levee Dist., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 248</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 130 (1947).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The correct procedure to secure additional authority for proper maintenance and improvements in a drainage district is by motion or petition in the original cause. In re Lyon Swamp Drainage &amp; Levee Dist., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 248</cite>,
                            45 S.E.2d 130 (1947).

                            Power to Issue Bonds and Make Assessments Applicable Only to Section of District Benefited. - Where proposed improvements and repairs will primarily benefit lands embraced in one section of a drainage district and would be of no substantial benefit to
                            landowners in another section thereof, the drainage commissioners have power under statutory authority to issue bonds and make assessments applicable only to the section benefited. In re Lyon Swamp Drainage &amp; Levee Dist.,

                            Readjustment. - When the rights and duties of adjoining landowners as to drainage in a certain canal have been determined under this Chapter, and judgment entered, proceedings subsequently brought for the purpose of readjustment, owing to change of ownership
                            and partition, etc., are in effect a motion in the cause, in which the judgment, unlike a final judgment, is not conclusive; and the cause can be brought forward from time to time, upon notice to the parties, and further decrees
                            made to conform to the exigencies and changes which may arise. Staton v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. 490</cite>, 62 S.E. 596 (1908); Sawyer Canal Co. v. Keys, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 360</cite>,

                            his land, upon the petition of other parties, filed under the provisions of this Chapter, is void, unless said landowner is made a party to the petition. Gamble v. McCrady, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 509</cite>                            (1876).

                            Where separate owners have derived their lands subject to a drainage system placed upon the entire tract by the original owner, each one using the system must bear the costs of maintenance and repair required by the portion of the system on his own premises.

                            is increased and accelerated so that the water is discharged on the land of an abutting owner. Mizell v. McGowan, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 134</cite>, 26 S.E. 783 (1897).

                            Prerequisites to Establishment of Drainage Corporation. - In order to establish a drainage corporation, it is necessary that a petition in conformity with G.S. 156-37 be filed, that commissioners be appointed and that they file a report in conformity
                            with G.S. 156-38, and that there be an adjudication and confirmation of the report. It is only after such confirmation that the corporation may be declared to exist and may proceed to organize and levy assessments. In re Atkinson-Clark

                        quantity of land tributary thereto. And upon filing the petition, summons shall issue to all parties having an easement in the canal, returnable as in other special proceedings; upon the return thereof, or upon a day fixed by the
                        clerk for hearing same, all owners of the canal may become corporators therein, and upon failure of any to avail themselves of that right, they shall not be entitled to become corporators, except under such bylaws and regulations

                        the amount of damages assessed shall be a first lien on the land of the owner against whom judgment shall be rendered.

                            assessments is one of benefit increasing the value of the land and justifying its assessment. In re Westover Canal, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 91</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 225 (1949).

                            Meaning of "Land Tributary to the Canal". - As used in this section, the phrases "land tributary thereto" and "land tributary to the canal" mean land from which water drains or flows into the canal. In re Westover Canal,

                            Burden of Proof on Appeal. - This section gives to any person dissatisfied with an assessment the right to appeal to a jury at a regular term of the superior court of the county. In such event, it would seem that the authority undertaking to establish
                            the assessment would still have the burden of proving the provisions of the statute essential to the creation of a valid assessment. It may be that the order of the clerk of the superior court approving and confirming the assessment
                            as proposed by the commissioners and the board of directors of the corporation creates a prima facie case. But a prima facie case, or prima facie evidence, does not change the burden of proof. In re Westover Canal,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">230 N.C. 91</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 225 (1949).

                        <p>
                            In order to constitute a valid drainage assessment, it is necessary that the land assessed drain or flow into the canal, and therefore on appeal to the superior court on a landowner's exceptions to the order of the clerk confirming assessments as proposed
                            by the commissioners, the drainage district has the burden of proving the number of acres of land owned by the exceptor which drain into the canal, and what amount said land should be assessed per acre. The fact that the exceptor
                            first introduced evidence, presumably on the theory that the order of the clerk made out a prima facie case, does not alter the rule as to the burden of proof. In re Westover Canal, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 91</cite>,

                            Finality of Judgment of Clerk of Superior Court. - A judgment entered by a clerk of the superior court in a special proceeding under this section will stand as a judgment of the court, if not excepted to and reversed or modified on appeal, as allowed
                            by law. In re Atkinson-Clark Canal Co., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 374</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 276 (1951).

                            clerk of the superior court was as final and effective as if no appeal therefrom had been attempted. In re Atkinson-Clark Canal Co., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 374</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 276 (1951).

                            In an action to compel corporate defendant to purchase property from plaintiffs in accordance with purchase contract, where defendant alleged that a judgment creating a canal corporation created a lien on the subject property which constituted an encumbrance
                            unsatisfactory to it and rendered plaintiffs' title unmarketable, the trial court erred in directing a verdict in defendant's favor on this ground, since the judgment creating a canal corporation was not entered into evidence
                            at trial; there was no indication in the record on appeal that the trial court took judicial notice of the judgment; a copy of the judgment was not included in the record on appeal; and there was thus no evidence of a canal
                            constituting an encumbrance on the subject property. Waters v. North Carolina Phosphate Corp., <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 273 S.E.2d 517, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 402</cite>,

                        Applicability of Section. - The provisions of this section providing for a penalty for nonpayment of assessments relate only to the remedy available where incorporators fail and refuse to pay assessments duly levied. Sawyer Canal Co. v. Keys,

                        In a proceeding by drainage corporations to have lands of respondents assessed for improvements, upon allegations that respondents were not members of the corporation but that nevertheless their lands drained into the canals and would be materially benefited
                        by the improvements, it was held that respondents' contention that the sole remedy of petitioners was under the provisions of this section to construct dams to prevent water from draining from respondents' lands into the canals
                        was untenable, since the provisions of this section were inapplicable to such proceeding, being applicable solely as a remedy where incorporators fail and refuse to pay assessments duly levied. Sawyer Canal Co. v. Keys,

                        The clerk of the superior court of any county in the State of North Carolina shall have jurisdiction, power and authority to establish levee or drainage districts either wholly or partly located in his county, and which shall constitute a political subdivision
                        of the State, and to locate and establish levees, drains or canals, and cause to be constructed, straightened, widened or deepened, any ditch, drain or watercourse, and to build levees or embankments and erect tidal gates and pumping
                        plants for the purpose of draining and reclaiming wet, swamp or overflowed land; and it is hereby declared that the drainage of swamplands and the drainage of surface water from agricultural lands and the reclamation of tidal marshes
                        shall be considered a public use and benefit and conducive to the public health, convenience and welfare, and that the districts heretofore and hereafter created under the law shall be and constitute political subdivisions of the
                        State, with authority to provide by law to levy taxes and assessments for the construction and maintenance of said public works.

                            Public Purposes of Subchapter Recognized. - This Subchapter, authorizing the establishment of certain levee or drainage districts, which presents a scheme for the drainage of lowlands in which the public of the locality is generally interested, which
                            is at once comprehensive, adequate and efficient, and in which the rights of all persons to be affected have been fully considered and protected, is not objectionable on the ground that it is for the benefit of private landowners

                            This Subchapter adopts a system for the cooperation of landowners in the drainage of lands by forming drainage districts, which are to become quasi-public corporations, for the purpose of improving the health of the district and the fertility of the lands,
                            under which the lands are assessed in proportion to the benefits derived and an organization is effected in each district to execute and maintain a system of drainage. In re Big Cold Water Creek Drainage Dist.,

                            Basis of Legislative Authority. - The authority of the legislature to provide for the creation of levee and drainage districts is based upon the police power, the right of eminent domain and the taxing power. Shelton v. White,

                            The drainage of swamps and of surface water from agricultural lands in a drainage district is of public benefit and conducive to the public health, etc., thus falling within the police power; and proceedings thereunder are in the exercise of the right
                            of eminent domain. Taylor v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 217</cite>, 96 S.E. 1027 (1918).

                            by the Constitution, the powers and duties conferred being of a judicial nature in relation to the prescribed proceedings to be instituted for the establishment of drainage districts. Sanderlin v. Luken,

                            Map Held Sufficient Notice to Subsequent Purchasers. - Where, in a proceeding in Beaufort County, a drainage district comprising lands in both Beaufort and Craven Counties was duly created and organized under this and the following sections, and assessment
                            rolls, showing assessments against each tract of land in the district, were made and filed in each county, such assessments, as they became due, constituted liens upon the lands within the district to which they related, and
                            it was error for the court to dismiss an action in the nature of a mortgage foreclosure, for the collection of such drainage assessments against lands in Craven County, even where the assessment rolls for Craven County had
                            been removed and there was left in that county no other record relating to the drainage district except a map on which were shown the boundaries of the several tracts of land within the district in Craven County, as the map
                            itself was sufficient notice to a subsequent purchaser of the proceedings, including the assessment rolls filed in Beaufort County. Nesbit v. Kafer, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 48</cite>, 21 S.E.2d

                            court holding that they were still pending, and because of the fact that the engineer and viewers did not file a profile map showing the surface of the ground, bottom grades, etc., at the time of the final report, as required
                            by G.S. 156-69, where this was later done upon order of the board of drainage commissioners, and otherwise the provisions of the statutes had been strictly followed. Oden v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 403</cite>,

                    <p>
                        A petition signed by a majority of the resident landowners in a proposed drainage district or by the owners of three fifths of all the land which will be affected or assessed for the expense of the proposed improvements may be filed in the office of the
                        clerk of the superior court of any county in which a part of the lands is located, setting forth that any specific body or district of land in the county and adjoining counties, described in such a way as to convey an intelligent
                        idea as to the location of such land, is subject to overflow or too wet for cultivation, and the public benefit or utility or the public health, convenience or welfare will be promoted by draining, ditching, or leveeing the same
                        or by changing or improving the natural watercourses, and setting forth therein, as far as practicable, the starting point, route, and terminus and lateral branches, if necessary, of the proposed improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The petition will also show whether or not the proposed drainage is for the reclamation of lands not then fit for cultivation or for the improvement of land already under cultivation. It shall also state that, if a reclamation district is proposed to
                        be established, such lands so reclaimed will be of such value as to justify the reclamation.

                            It is sufficient that summons is served upon the parties in possession under an apparent legal title, and that before final adjudication notice is given in the manner prescribed, in order that parties claiming liens by mortgage

                        The clerk shall, on the filing of petition and bond, appoint a disinterested and competent civil and drainage engineer and two resident freeholders of the county or counties in which the lands are located as a board of viewers to examine the lands described
                        in the petition and make a preliminary report thereon. The drainage engineer shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the Department of Environmental Quality; and no member of the board of viewers so appointed shall own any
                        land within the boundaries of the proposed district. In the selection of the two members of the board of viewers, other than the engineer, the clerk before making the appointment shall make careful inquiry into the character and
                        qualifications of the proposed members, to the end that the members so appointed shall possess the necessary character, capacity, fitness, and impartiality for the discharge of their important duties.

                        The clerk may make an estimate of the aggregate sum of money which shall appear to be necessary to pay all the expenses incident to the performance of the duties by the board of viewers, including the compensation of the drainage engineer and his necessary
                        assistants, and also including the sum for the compensation of the attorney for the district, and such court costs as may probably accrue, which estimates shall embrace the period of services up to and including the establishment
                        of the drainage district and the selection and appointment of the board of drainage commissioners. The clerk shall then estimate the number of acres of land owned or represented by the petitioners, as nearly so as may be practicable
                        without actual survey, and shall assess each acre so represented a level rate per acre, to the end that such assessment will realize the sum of money which he has estimated as necessary to pay all necessary costs of the drainage
                        proceeding up to the time of the appointment of the drainage commissioners, as above provided. The assessment above provided for which has been or may hereafter be levied shall constitute a first and paramount lien, second only
                        to State and county taxes, upon the lands so assessed, and shall be collected in the same manner and by the same officers as county taxes are collected. The board of viewers, including the drainage engineer, shall not be required
                        to enter upon the further discharge of their duties until the amount so estimated and assessed shall be paid in cash to the clerk of the court, which shall be retained by him as a court fund, and for which he shall be liable in
                        his official capacity, and he shall be authorized to disburse the same in the prosecution of the drainage proceeding. Unless all the assessments shall be paid within a time to be fixed by the court, which may be extended from time
                        to time, no further proceedings shall be had, and the proceeding shall be dismissed at the cost of the petitioners. If the entire sum so estimated and assessed shall not be paid to the clerk within the time limited, the amounts
                        so paid shall be refunded to the petitioners pro rata after paying the necessary costs accrued. Nothing herein contained shall prevent one or more of the petitioners from subscribing and paying any sum in addition to their assessment
                        in order to make up any deficiency arising from the delinquency of one or more of the petitioners. When the sum of money so estimated shall be paid, the board of viewers shall proceed with the discharge of their duties, and in
                        all other respects the proceeding shall be prosecuted according to the law. After the district shall have been established and the board of drainage commissioners appointed, it shall be the duty of the board of drainage commissioners
                        to refund to each of the petitioners the amount so paid by them as above provided, out of the first moneys which shall come into the hands of the board from the sale of bonds or otherwise, and the same shall be included in ascertaining
                        the total cost of improvement.

                        In lieu of the procedures set forth in the preceding paragraph, the board of county commissioners may advance funds, or any part thereof, for the purposes set forth in the preceding paragraph. Such advances shall be made to a county official designated
                        by the commissioners, and shall be disbursed upon such terms as the county commissioners may direct. If the district shall be organized, the funds advanced shall be repaid from assessments thereafter levied.

                    <p>
                        At the date appointed for the hearing the court shall hear and determine any objections that may be offered to the report of the viewers. If it appear that there is any land within the proposed levee or drainage district that will not be affected by the
                        leveeing or drainage thereof, such lands shall be excluded and the names of the owners withdrawn from such proceeding; and if it shall be shown that there is any land not within the proposed district that will be affected by the
                        construction of the proposed levee or drain, the boundary of the district shall be so changed as to include such land, and such additional landowners shall be made parties plaintiff or defendant, respectively, and summons shall
                        issue accordingly, as hereinbefore provided. After such change in the boundary is made, the sufficiency of the petition shall be verified, to determine whether or not it conforms to the requirements hereinbefore provided. The efficiency
                        of the drainage or levees may also be determined, and if it appears that the location of any levee or drain can be changed so as to make it more effective, or that other branches or spurs should be constructed, or that any branch
                        or spur projected may be eliminated or other changes made that will tend to increase the benefits of the proposed work, such modification and changes shall be made by the board. The engineer and the other two viewers may attend
                        this meeting and give any information or evidence that may be sought to verify and substantiate their report. If necessary, the petition, as amended, shall be referred by the court to the engineer and two viewers for further report.
                        The above facts having been determined to the satisfaction of the court, and the boundaries of the proposed district so determined, it shall declare the establishment of the drainage or levee district, which shall be designated
                        by a name or number, for the object and purpose as herein set forth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If any lands shall be excluded from the district because of the court having found that such lands will not be affected or benefited, and the names of the owners of such lands have been withdrawn from such proceeding, but such lands are so situated as
                        necessarily to be located within the outer boundaries of the district, such fact shall not prevent the establishment of the district, and such lands shall not be assessed for any drainage tax; but this shall not prevent the district
                        from acquiring a right-of-way across such lands for constructing a canal or ditch or for any other necessary purpose authorized by law.

                            Reason for Conferring Power to Include Lands of Opposing Owners. - It is because of the benefits which accrue to the public from the establishment of a drainage district under the statute that power conferred thereby upon the court to include lands of
                            owners who are unwilling to sign the petition or who oppose the establishment of the district is sustained. O'Neal v. Mann, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 153</cite>, 136 S.E. 379 (1927).

                            What Issues May Be Raised by Minority Landowner. - A minority landowner included in a proposed drainage district to be laid out may not contest the formation of the district, but may only raise the issue as to his benefits therefrom. Shelton v. White,
                            <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 90</cite>, 79 S.E. 427 (1913).

                            Right of Signer of Original Petition to Object. - Upon the report of the viewers at the final hearing in proceedings to lay off a drainage district, one who signed the original petition and may have ascertained from the information contained in the report,
                            contrary to his previous opinion, that the cost of the improvements and damages would amount to more than the benefits to his land, may then file his objections, and the same procedure is then open to him as if he had not signed
                            the petition. Shelton v. White, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 90</cite>, 79 S.E. 427 (1913).

                            Boundaries Must Include All Lands Benefited. - The court has no authority to decree the establishment of a drainage district which does not include within its boundaries all lands benefited by the work to be done. It must enlarge the boundaries to include
                            all such land. In re Albemarle Drainage Dist., Beaufort County No. 5, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 338</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 599 (1961).

                            a majority owner to raise only the issue of fact for the jury to determine as to the benefit to his lands; and should the jury find in favor of the objector, he is not entitled as a matter of right to have his land excluded,
                            but it is for the judge to decide whether this may be done without injury to the district, and if not, he may order that such land be retained upon payment of damages to be awarded by the jury, as in condemnation of lands;

        § 156-71. Classification of lands and benefits.
       </b>
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        It shall be the further duty of the engineer and viewers to personally examine the land in the district and classify it with reference to the benefit it will receive from the construction of the levee, ditch, drain, or watercourse or other improvement.
                        In the case of drainage, the degree of wetness on the land, its proximity to the ditch or a natural outlet, and the fertility of the soil shall be considered in determining the amount of benefit it will receive by the construction
                        of the ditch. The land benefited shall be separated in five classes. The land receiving the highest benefit shall be marked "Class A"; that receiving the next highest benefit, "Class B"; that receiving the next highest benefit,
                        "Class C"; that receiving the next highest benefit, "Class D," and that receiving the smallest benefit, "Class E." The holdings of any one landowner need not be all in one class, but the number of acres in each class shall be ascertained,
                        though its boundary need not be marked on the ground or shown on the map. The total number of acres owned by one person in each class and the total number of acres benefited shall be determined. The total number of acres of each
                        class in the entire district shall be obtained and presented in tabulated form. The scale of assessment upon the several classes of land returned by the engineer and viewers shall be in the ratio of five, four, three, two, and
                        one; that is to say, as often as five mills per acre is assessed against the land in "Class A," four mills per acre shall be assessed against the land in "Class B," three mills per acre in "Class C," two mills per acre in "Class
                        D," and one mill per acre in "Class E." This shall form the basis of the assessment of benefits to the lands for drainage purposes. In any district lands may be included which are not benefited for the agriculture or crop production,
                        or slightly so, but which will receive benefit by improvement in health conditions, and as to such lands the engineer and viewers may assess each tract of land without regard to the ratio and at such a sum per acre as will fairly
                        represent the benefit of such lands. Villages or towns or parts thereof and small parcels of land located outside thereof and used primarily for residence or other specific purposes, and which require drainage, may also be included
                        in any drainage district which by reason of their improved conditions and the limited area in each parcel under individual ownership, it is impracticable to fairly assess the benefits to each separated parcel of land by the ratio
                        herein provided, and as to such parcels of land the engineer and viewers may assess each parcel of land without regard to the ratio and at a higher rate per acre respectively by reason of the greater benefits. If the streets or
                        other property owned by any incorporated town or village are likewise benefited by such drainage works, the corporation may be assessed in proportion to such benefits, which assessment shall constitute a liability against the corporation
                        and may be enforced as provided by law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The board of viewers may determine that some areas of the district will receive more benefits than other areas and if such is determined, the varying benefits shall be reflected in the manner of classification of benefits to each area and the tracts of
                        land therein.

                            Discretion of Commissioners as to Classification Under Local Act. - The legislature, in authorizing the establishment of a drainage district, may very largely commit to the commissioners the exercise of their judgment as to what should be done in carrying
                            out the general provisions specified by the statute; and the special act of the legislature creating the Gaston County Drainage Commission, c. 427, Public-Local Laws of 1911, thus construed, does not relieve a landowner therein
                            from paying his authorized assessments for benefits solely because the commission failed to strictly and literally divide the lands into the number of classes therein set out. Mitchem v. Gaston County Drainage Comm'n,

                            Final Decree as Adjudication That Benefits Exceed Burdens. - A final decree in proceedings to lay off a statutory drainage district is an adjudication that the benefits to the land within the district are more than the burdens assessed against it for
                            such purpose. Banks v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 14</cite>, 86 S.E. 713 (1915), petition for rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 505</cite>, 88 S.E. 754 (1916).

                            Failure to Object as Waiver. - Where a drainage district has been duly laid off in conformity with the statute, and a landowner therein has not excepted to either the preliminary or final report, he may not, after appointment of the commissioners, be
                            heard to complain that the benefits he is to receive are not as great as those he had contemplated. Griffin v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 642</cite>, 86 S.E. 575 (1915).

                            The question as to whether an owner of land within a drainage district has realized the benefits anticipated is eliminated when the district is established upon the report; and where such owner remains silent or makes no objection or exception at the
                            proper time as to the proceedings of the board, his silence is a waiver of any right he may have had therein, and an independent remedy by injunction is not open to him. Mitchem v. Gaston County Drainage Comm'n,

                        Subchapter. In an appeal to the superior court taken under this section or any other section or provision of the drainage laws of the State, general or local, the appeal has precedence in consideration and trial by the court. If
                        other issues also have precedence in the superior court under existing law, the court, in its discretion, determines the order in which they are heard.

                    The name of such drainage district shall constitute a part of its corporate name; for illustration, the board of drainage commissioners of Mecklenburg Drainage District, No. 1. In the naming of a drainage district the clerk of the court, notwithstanding
                    the name given in the petition, shall so change the name as to make it conform to the county within which the district, or the main portion of the district, is located, and such district shall also be designated by number, the number
                    to indicate the number of districts petitioned for in the county. For illustration, the first district organized in Mecklenburg County would be Mecklenburg County Drainage District, No. 1; the name of the second would be Mecklenburg
                    County Drainage District, No. 2; the fifth one organized would be Mecklenburg County Drainage District, No. 5: Provided, that so much of this section as provides for numbering the districts in each county shall not apply to districts

                    The board of drainage commissioners shall cause notice to be given of the letting of the contract. The notice shall be posted at the courthouse door in the county wherein the district was organized. Notice shall be posted no less than 15 days prior to
                    the opening of the bids and shall be published at least once a week for two consecutive weeks immediately prior to the opening of the bids, in some newspaper published in the county wherein such improvement is located, if such there
                    be, and such additional publication elsewhere as they may deem expedient, of the time and place of letting the work of construction of such improvement, and in such notice they shall specify the approximate amount of work to be done
                    and the time fixed for the completion thereof; and on the date appointed for the letting they, together with the superintendent of construction, shall convene and let to the lowest responsible bidder, either as a whole or in sections,
                    as they may deem most advantageous for the district, the proposed work. No bid shall be entertained that exceeds the estimated cost, except for good and satisfactory reasons it shall be shown that the original estimate was erroneous.
                    They shall have the right to reject all bids and advertise again the work, if in their judgment the interest of the district will be subserved by doing so. The successful bidder shall be required to enter into a contract with the board
                    of drainage commissioners and to execute a bond for the faithful performance of such contract, with sufficient sureties, in favor of the board of drainage commissioners for the use and benefit of the levee or drainage district, in
                    an amount equal to no less than 25 nor more than one hundred per centum (100%) of the estimated cost of the work awarded to him. In canvassing bids and letting the contract, the superintendent of construction shall act only in an advisory
                    capacity to the board of drainage commissioners. The contract shall be based on the plans and specifications submitted by the viewers in their final report as confirmed by the court, the original of which shall remain on file in the
                    office of the clerk of the superior court and shall be open to the inspection of all prospective bidders. All bids shall be sealed and shall not be opened except under the authority of the board of drainage commissioners and on the
                    day theretofore appointed for opening the bids. The drainage commissioners shall have power to correct errors and modify the details of the report of the engineer and viewers if, in their judgment, they can increase the efficiency
                    of the drainage plan and afford better drainage to the lands in the district without increasing the estimated cost submitted by the engineer and viewers and confirmed by the court.

                    to repair or remove any old bridge and/or build any new bridge to provide the minimum drainage space determined by the court; whereupon the court shall hear all evidence pertaining thereto and shall determine whether the Department
                    of Transportation shall be required to do such work, and whether at its own expense or whether the cost thereof should be prorated between the Department of Transportation and the drainage district. Either party shall have the right

                    Whenever the Department of Transportation is required to repair or remove any old bridge and/or build any new bridge as hereinbefore provided, the same may be done in such manner and according to such specifications as it deems best, and no assessment
                    shall be charged the Department of Transportation for any benefits to the highway affected by the drain under the same, and such bridge shall thereafter be maintained by and at the expense of the Department of Transportation.

                    Where any public ditch, drain, or watercourse established under the provisions of this Subchapter crosses a public highway or road, not under the supervision of the Department of Transportation, the actual cost of constructing the same across the highway
                    or removing old bridges or building new ones shall be paid for from the funds of the drainage district. Whenever any highway within the levee or drainage district shall be beneficially affected by the construction of any improvement

                    of the owner in charge of the work to notify the railroad company, by serving written notice upon the agent of such company or its lessee or receiver, that they will meet the company at the place where the proposed ditch, drain, or
                    watercourse crosses the right-of-way of such company, the notice fixing the time of such meeting, which shall not be less than 10 days after the service of the same, for the purpose of conferring with the railroad company with relation
                    to the place where and the manner in which such improvement shall cross such right-of-way. When the time fixed for such conference shall arrive, unless for good cause more time is agreed upon, it shall be the duty of the viewers in
                    charge and the railroad company to agree, if possible, upon the place where and the manner and method in which such improvement shall cross such right-of-way. If the viewers in charge and the railroad company cannot agree, or if the
                    railroad company shall fail, neglect, or refuse to confer with the viewers, they shall determine the place and manner of crossing the right-of-way of the railroad company, and shall specify the number and size of openings required,
                    and the damages, if any, to the railroad company, and so specify in their report. The fact that the railroad company is required by the construction of the improvement to build a new bridge or culvert or to enlarge or strengthen an
                    old one shall not be considered as damages to the railroad company. The engineer and viewers shall also assess the benefits that will accrue to the right-of-way, roadbed, and other property of the company by affording better drainage
                    or a better outlet for drainage, but no benefits shall be assessed because of the increase in business that may come to the road because of the construction of the improvement. The benefits shall be assessed as a fixed sum, determined
                    solely by the physical benefit that its property will receive by the construction of the improvement, and it shall be reported by the viewers as a special assessment, due personally from the railroad company as a special assessment;
                    it may be collected in the manner of an ordinary debt in any court having jurisdiction.

                    Whenever any improvement constructed under this Subchapter is completed it shall be under the control and supervision of the board of drainage commissioners. It shall be the duty of the board to keep the levee, ditch, drain, or watercourse in good repair,
                    and for this purpose they may levy an assessment on the lands benefited by the maintenance or repair of such improvement in the same manner and in the same proportion as the original assessments were made, and the fund that is collected
                    shall be used for repairing and maintaining the ditch, drain, or watercourse in perfect order: Provided, however, that if any repairs are made necessary by the act or negligence of the owner of any land through which such improvement
                    is constructed or by the act or negligence of his agent or employee, or if the same is caused by the cattle, hogs, or other stock of such owner, employee, or agent, then the cost thereof shall be assessed and levied against the lands
                    of the owner alone, to be collected by proper suit instituted by the drainage commissioners. It shall be unlawful for any person to injure or damage or obstruct or build any bridge, fence, or floodgate in such a way as to injure or
                    damage any levee, ditch, drain, or watercourse constructed or improved under the provisions of this Subchapter, and any person causing such injury shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof may only be fined
                    in any sum not exceeding twice the damage or injury done or caused.

                        Amendment by Implication. - Public Laws 1923, c. 231, which added former G.S. 156-118 and G.S. 156-123, had the effect of amending this section. This section authorizes the drainage commissioners to levy an assessment upon the lands in the district for
                        the purpose of keeping up the drainage. The amending statutes provided that the commissioners could issue bonds instead of levying an assessment. In re Perquimans County Drainage Dist. No. Four, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 155</cite>,

                        Under the statute creating the Mattamuskeet Drainage District, control thereof, after its completion, is continued in the board of drainage commissioners for the purpose of its maintenance, and authority is given it to levy assessments therefor on the
                        lands benefited in the same manner and in the same proportion as the "original assessments" were made, and collected by the same officers as those by whom the State and county taxes are collected. It was held that the term "original
                        assessments" refers to those made for construction work on bonds issued therefor, and the assessments for maintenance should be collected by the sheriff of the county for the purpose of maintenance, as taxes for general county

                        The land clause of the Constitution of North Carolina is violated insofar as G.S. 156-138.3 dispenses with notice and an opportunity to be heard before imposing maintenance assessments on landowners within the drainage district; the imposition of these
                        assessments was not a matter of mathematical computation, but rather, it involved some discretion on the part of the commissioners. Northampton County Drainage Dist. Number One v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 742</cite>,

                        Purpose of Article. - The legislature, when it enacted Subchapter III, authorizing the establishment of drainage districts, made no provision for an alteration and enlargement of the boundaries subsequent to the date of creation, for the simple reason
                        that the boundaries as finally determined had to include all lands benefited by the improvement, and the lands so benefited were required to be assessed for the benefits accruing, and hence no assessment could be levied either
                        for original construction or for cost of maintenance on lands beyond the boundaries. However, the 1961 legislature, recognizing that lands not originally expected to receive benefit from works to be performed by a drainage district
                        might, by changing conditions and the modification or enlargement and maintenance of the drains, receive benefits from work subsequently proposed to be done, made provision for the enlargement of the boundaries of drainage districts.

                        Assessments Are Not "Taxes." - Assessments made for the maintenance of a drainage district, incorporated under the provisions of the statute, are not "taxes," even though they may be so incorrectly denominated therein; they are only assessments made for
                        the special benefits to the land within the district, and are not imposed for the purpose of general revenue. Drainage Comm'rs v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 140</cite>, 108 S.E. 506 (1921).

                        Assessments upon lands in a drainage district are liens in rem, resting upon the lands, into whosesoever hands they may be at the time they accrue, and do not come within the terms of a warranty against encumbrances by deed. Taylor v. Commissioners of
                        Moseley Creek Drainage Dist., <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 217</cite>, 96 S.E. 1027 (1918).

                        Grantee of Timber Interest Not Liable for Assessment. - A conveyance of the timber, under the usual deed, providing for its cutting and removal from the land within a stated period, is regarded as a severance thereof from the land, and the grantee in
                        the deed is not liable for an assessment for drainage purposes laid thereon. Dover Lumber Co. v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 117</cite>, 91 S.E. 714 (1917).

                        Liability for Additional Assessments. - The land of the owner who has paid his assessments, as provided by this section, is subject to additional assessments, the lands in the district being liable until the original bond issue for making the improvements
                        or indebtedness incurred therefor is paid in full. Virginia-Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank v. Watt, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 577</cite>, 178 S.E. 228 (1935).

                    <p>
                        Power of Courts to Enjoin Collection of Assessments. - The courts, in proper instances, have the power to interfere and stay amounts assessed against the owner of lands within an established drainage district, when it appears that the commissioners, in
                        carrying out the ministerial duties imposed on them, endeavored to collect from him a sum in excess of their own assessment, or that they had made out the rolls in utter disregard of the classifications and ratio of assessments
                        established by the final report, or that they had made such changes in the plans and specifications thereof as to exceed their powers and to work substantial wrong and hardship upon the landowner, if he was not guilty of laches
                        and had not unduly delayed asserting his rights. Griffin v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 642</cite>, 86 S.E. 575 (1915).

                    <p>
                        Where a drainage district has been fully and lawfully established in accordance with the statute, the commissioners have been duly appointed, and bonds have been issued in furtherance of the scheme, an injunction restraining the collection of the assessment
                        against the landowners therein, at the suit of one of them, will not issue, as against the interest of the holder of the bonds, unless it clearly appears that the commissioners have substantially departed, to the injury of the
                        claimant, from the scheme set forth in the final report of the viewers, etc. Griffin v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 642</cite>, 86 S.E. 575 (1915).

                        Purchaser Takes with Notice of Assessments. - The purchaser of lands within a drainage district formed under the provisions of this Chapter is fixed by the statute with notice of the assessments and the time thereof, whether a resident of another state
                        or not. Pate v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 139</cite>, 100 S.E. 251 (1919).

                        Presumption as to Notice. - The presumption is in favor of the regularity of the official proceedings of the commissioners of a drainage district, and applies to landowners within the district as to the sufficiency of notice of a meeting duly had to assess
                        such owners according to benefits received from the improvements therein. Mitchem v. Gaston County Drainage Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 511</cite>, 109 S.E. 551 (1921).

                        Waiver of Notice. - Where the owner of land in a drainage district, formed under the provisions of the statute, appears at a meeting of the commissioners held for the purpose and is silent, making no objection or exception to the assessment imposed upon
                        his land, the question as to whether he had been sufficiently served with notice of the meeting becomes immaterial, his appearance being construed as a waiver thereof, or rather as dispensing with formal notice, and he cannot collaterally,
                        by injunction, restrain the collection of these assessments by sheriff's sale. This also applies to his grantee who knew that the lands were situate within the district and subject to the assessments. Mitchem v. Gaston County Drainage

                    In lieu of the bonds provided for in G.S. 156-97, the board of drainage commissioners may issue assessment anticipation notes of the district for an amount not to exceed the assessment levied by the commissioners and approved by the clerk of the superior

                    not more than fourteen percent (14%) interest from the date of issue, payable semiannually. The first annual installment of principal shall be due not less than one year nor more than two years after date thereof, and each annual installment
                    of principal shall not be less than two percent (2%) nor more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total amount of notes authorized and issued.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such assessment anticipation notes, when issued, shall have the same force and effect of bonds issued under the provisions of this Article and shall be collectible in the same manner.

                <p>
                    The commissioners may issue either serial notes or an amortized note.

                    of the secretary, and both the principal and interest coupons shall be payable at some bank or trust company to be designated by the board of drainage commissioners and incorporated in the body of the bond. The form of the bond shall
                    be authorized by the board of drainage commissioners or by the board and the purchaser of the bonds jointly, at the option of the board.

                    All bonds of reclamation districts shall have that fact noted upon the face of the bond, either by stamping or printing the same thereon. All bonds of improvement districts shall also have that fact noted upon their face.

                    For the purpose of meeting any possible deficit in the collection of annual drainage assessments or any deficit arising out of unforeseen contingencies there shall be levied, assessed and collected during each year when either the interest or principal
                    or both interest and principal on the outstanding bonds shall be due, an assessment as will yield ten percent (10%) more than the total of interest and principal due in such years; that is to say, for every one hundred dollars ($100.00)
                    of principal and interest, or either, due in any one year, there shall be levied, assessed and collected a sufficient drainage assessment to yield one hundred and ten dollars ($110.00) for such year. When this excess of drainage tax
                    so levied, assessed and collected shall accumulate so that the aggregate surplus in the hands of the treasurer of the district shall amount to more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total principal of the bonds of the district outstanding
                    and unpaid, then such surplus above fifteen percent (15%) thereof may be available for expenditure by the board of drainage commissioners in the maintenance and upkeep of the drainage work in such district in the manner provided by
                    law: After all the drainage assessments have been collected except the last assessment, if the surplus which has accumulated amounts to more than five percent (5%) of the total issue of bonds of the district, then and in such event
                    the board of drainage commissioners may in their discretion apply such excess above five percent (5%) toward the reduction of the total amount embraced in the last assessment, reducing the same pro rata as to each tract of land embraced
                    in the district, and having regard to the classification, to the end that such reduction shall be fairly and justly made. As to such surplus as shall accumulate in the hands of the treasurer of the district over and above all obligations
                    of the district which may be due, the treasurer is hereby directed to deposit same in some solvent bank or banks at the highest rate of interest obtainable therefor, and the said treasurer shall be authorized, if he deems it necessary,
                    to demand satisfactory security for such deposits; but the said treasurer shall reserve the right to demand a repayment at any time upon giving not exceeding 30 days' notice thereof. Whereas the proceeds of the first drainage assessment
                    may not be collected and in the hands of the treasurer of the district prior to the maturity of the first and second semiannual installments of interest upon the issue of bonds, the treasurer of the district is hereby directed to pay
                    the interest coupons first maturing and also the interest coupons next maturing, if necessary, out of funds in his hands for the purpose of maintaining the improvement for the period of three years after the completion of the work
                    or construction. As a surplus fund with the treasurer arising out of the annual additional assessment of ten per centum (10%) shall accumulate in any one year in excess of fifteen per centum (15%) of the total principal of the bonds
                    of the district outstanding and unpaid, as herein provided, the treasurer shall transfer in each of such years such surplus fund to the fund for maintaining the improvement after completion, as a reimbursement of the fund formerly
                    withdrawn therefrom for the payment of the first and second installments of interest coupons until such reimbursement shall be fully made. The treasurer shall thereafter keep separate accounts of the proceeds of such additional ten
                    percent (10%) assessment remaining each year after the payment of all maturing obligations, and also a separate account of the funds provided for maintaining the improvement for the period of three years after completion of improvement
                    and all payments therefrom and reimbursements thereto.

                        The remedy provided by statute to the holders of drainage bonds to enforce payment of their obligations is by action against the drainage district and its commissioners and the tax collector and treasurer to compel these officers to perform their legal
                        duties in pursuing the statutory procedure for the collection and application of drainage assessments, which remedy is adequate and exclusive, and the holder of past-due bonds may not maintain an action against the owner of land

                    The board of drainage commissioners shall immediately prepare the assessment rolls or drainage tax lists, giving thereon the names of the owners of land in the district and a brief description of the several tracts of land assessed and the amount of assessment
                    against each tract of land. The first of these assessment rolls shall be due and payable on the first Monday in September following the date of such bonds, and shall provide funds sufficient for the payment of interest on such bonds
                    for one year. The second assessment roll shall make like provision for the payment of the interest for one year. Annual assessment rolls shall thereafter provide funds sufficient to meet the interest for one year on the issue of bonds
                    outstanding. During the year previous to maturity of any annual installment due upon the principal of said bonds there shall be an assessment roll sufficient to provide funds for the payment of both the interest for one year and for
                    the payment of the annual installment due upon the principal of the bonds. Such annual assessments shall be made from year to year to provide funds to meet the interest for one year and the annual installment of the principal due upon
                    the bonds outstanding, until the whole principal due upon the outstanding bonds and the interest thereon shall be fully paid. In making up such assessment rolls there shall be included ten percent (10%) additional as provided in G.S.
                    156-98. Each of the assessment rolls shall specify the time when collectible and be numbered in their order, and the amounts assessed against the several tracts of land shall be in accordance with the benefits received, as shown by
                    the classification and ratio of assessments made by the viewers. These assessment rolls shall be signed by the chairman of the board of drainage commissioners and by the secretary of the board. There shall be four copies of each of
                    the assessment rolls, one of which shall be filed with the drainage record, one shall be filed with the chairman of the board of drainage commissioners, who shall carefully preserve the same, one shall be preserved by the clerk of
                    the court, without change or mutilation, for the purposes of reference or comparison, and one shall be delivered to the sheriff, or other county tax collector, after the clerk of the superior court has appended thereto an order directing
                    the collection of such assessments, and the assessments, shall thereupon have the force and effect of a judgment as in the case of State and county taxes. If the drainage commission which has assessed the lands of a drainage district
                    prior to March 11, 1919, shall file the aforesaid four copies of assessment rolls within six months from April 1, 1919, the filing of such assessment rolls shall have the same legal effect as if filed strictly in accordance with this
                    section immediately after the preparation of such assessment rolls. The State having authorized the creation of drainage districts and having delegated thereto the power to levy a valid tax in furtherance of the public purposes thereof,
                    it is hereby declared that drainage districts heretofore or hereafter organized under existing law or any subsequent amendments thereto are created for a public use and are political subdivisions of the State.

                    shall be the duty of the sheriff or tax collector to sell the lands so delinquent. The sale of lands for failure to pay such assessments shall be made at the courthouse door of the county in which the lands are situated, between the

                    commissioners of the district shall be deemed the purchaser in its corporate capacity at a sum sufficient to pay all assessments which are due and costs as above stated, and shall be entitled to receive a certificate of purchase and
                    deed in the manner provided by law for purchasers at tax sales. The board of drainage commissioners shall only be required to pay to the sheriff the costs and expenses of sale before receiving a certificate of purchase. The board of
                    drainage commissioners of the district in their corporate capacity shall be in like position and have the same rights and be subject to the same duties as the purchaser of lands at any tax sale under the general law. If the board of
                    drainage commissioners shall have been the purchaser of lands so sold, the amount paid in redemption by the owner, or any person having an estate therein or lien thereon, shall include the sum bid therefor plus the penalty. The board
                    of drainage commissioners shall pay to the sheriff or tax collector the amount representing their bid at the sale of said lands before they shall be entitled to receive a deed therefor, which the sheriff shall pay to the treasurer
                    of the drainage district in the same manner as other funds received by him. The board of drainage commissioners, after acquiring a deed for said lands, may hold the same as an asset of the district, and shall be liable for the payment
                    of all drainage assessments and State and county taxes accruing after the sale at which the district was a bidder, and in all respects be deemed the owner of said lands and subject to the same privileges and liabilities as any other
                    landowner, including the right to convey the said lands for a consideration and pay the proceeds of said sale to the treasurer of the district, which may be distributed by the drainage commissioners for the benefit of the district
                    in the same manner as other district funds.

                <p>
                    If any sheriff or tax collector failed for any reason to collect drainage assessments upon lands in any drainage districts due in 1917, or any subsequent years, and further failed to make valid sales of the lands so delinquent in the payment of such assessments,
                    then and in such event the existing sheriff or tax collector is hereby authorized and directed to proceed to collect such unpaid drainage assessments, with interest thereon from the dates when such assessments respectively became due,
                    and in default of payment being made he is further authorized to make sales of such lands as may be in default at any time hereafter, at the times and in the manner authorized by law as amended herein; and the purchaser at said sales
                    shall acquire title to such lands in the manner provided by law. If the sheriff or tax collector in office at the time such assessments were in default has since died or gone out of office, the powers herein given shall be exercised
                    by the existing sheriff or tax collector.

                        Due Process of Law Not Denied. - The statute under which a drainage district is formed does not deny the district due process of law by providing for the collection and security of the assessments as other county taxes are collected, kept, etc. Commissioners
                        of Robeson County v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 528</cite>, 94 S.E. 8 (1917).

                    <p>
                        Assessments upon lands in a drainage district are a lien in rem on the lands of the owner for the payment of the bonds issued by the district in accordance with the statute, the district being a geographical quasi-public corporation, and the benefits
                        annually accruing to the advantage of successive owners. Such assessments are due and payable at stated intervals. Pate v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 139</cite>, 100 S.E. 251 (1919).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The legislature intended that the assessments as shown on the assessment rolls which the board of drainage commissioners is required to prepare immediately upon the sale of the bonds become liens as they become due, affecting all of the lands on the assessment
                        rolls, which relate to the entire district for the entire period over which the payment of the assessments is spread. Nesbit v. Kafer, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 48</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 903 (1942).

                    <p>
                        Lien Not a Debt of the Landowner. - The lien of the charges for drainage is not a debt of the owner of the land therein, but is a charge solely upon the land, and accrues, pari passu, with the benefits as they shall accrue thereafter. They are not liens
                        until they successfully fall due, and are presumed to be paid out of the increased productiveness and other benefits as they accrue from time to time. These assessments are to be levied from time to time to pay, not the indebtedness
                        of the owner of any tract, but to pay the bonded indebtedness of the district, in that they are exactly like bonds issued by the township, county or State for public benefits and which become liens on property in futuro only to
                        the extent of the taxes falling due each year to pay the interest, and such part of the principal as may become due. One who purchases land in a township, county or State cannot complain that these successive tax liens will, from
                        time to time, be collectible out of his realty. Whether he knew of the existence of such indebtedness or not makes no difference. They are not encumbrances within the sense of the warranty clause of a deed. The assessment in a
                        drainage district to take the water off the land is simply an annual tax for that purpose. Pate v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 139</cite>, 100 S.E. 251 (1919).

                        Liens Do Not Fall Within a Warranty Against Encumbrances Until Due and Payable. - Liens on lands within a statutory drainage district for assessment charges for its maintenance and upkeep do not fall within a warranty or covenant against encumbrances
                        contained in a deed until they are due and payable. Branch v. Saunders, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 176</cite>, 141 S.E. 583 (1928).

                        Failure to Levy Annual Assessments No Bar to Later Collection. - This section provides that assessments shall be collected "in the same manner and by the same officers as the state and county taxes are collected," and G.S. 105-394(3) provides that "[t]he
                        failure to list, appraise, or assess any property for taxation or to levy any tax within the time prescribed by law" is an immaterial irregularity that does not affect the validity of the assessment; therefore, plaintiff drainage
                        district's failure to levy annual assessments for 1974 and 1983 by the first Monday in September of those years did not bar later collection of the assessments. Northampton County Drainage Dist. No. 1 v. Bailey,

                        The drainage assessments collected are public funds although they are to be used solely for the purpose of paying principal and interest on drainage bonds. Wilkinson v. Boomer, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 217</cite>, 7 S.E.2d

                        Assessments are public money of county. - This and the following sections impress the moneys derived from the assessments as public money of the county, to be kept in the depository designated under the statute for such funds, although the funds in question
                        are devoted to a particular or defined use. Commissioners of Robeson County v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 528</cite>, 94 S.E. 8 (1917).

                        Remedy for Collection Is Adequate. - It is provided by this section that drainage assessments shall be collected in the same manner as taxes are collected. Such liens may be collected by sale of the land by the sheriff, with issue of certificates of sale,
                        with right in the holder of the certificates to foreclose in due time, or by foreclosure of the lien in a suit instituted by the district or the holder of a tax deed or certificate, in the nature of an action to foreclose a mortgage.
                        This remedy for the collection of such assessments is adequate. Wilkinson v. Boomer, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 217</cite>, 7 S.E.2d 491 (1940).

                <p>
                    Where any drainage district which has been established contains lands located in a county or counties other than the county in which the district was established, the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the district was established shall
                    have prepared annually during the month of August a form of tax bills or receipts, with appropriate stubs attached, covering all the lands in the drainage district located in such other county or counties, and in the form herein provided
                    for the county in which the district has been established, and have the same substantially bound in book form. He shall also fill in the blanks of such tax receipts ready for the signature of the collector. On a page in such bound

                    - County of ____________. The Sheriff or Tax Collector of ______________ County: This is to certify that the foregoing tax bills or blank receipts embrace the drainage assessments made on certain lands in the county of __________________,
                    which are located in and are a part of (here insert the name of the drainage district), which district was established in the county of __________________.These assessments are due on the first Monday of September, ________, and must
                    be paid and collected within the time required by law. You will make monthly settlements of your collections with the treasurer of __________________ County, being the county in which the district was established, and in all other
                    respects you will discharge your duties as sheriff or tax collector as required by law. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and official seal, this ________ day of ____________, ________.

                    the county in which the district was established. The auditor for drainage districts herein authorized shall also examine the records and accounts of the sheriff of such county. In the establishment and administration of the drainage

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Section 156-81.1, as enacted by Session Laws 1963, c. 767, s. 4, provided that all references in Subchapter III of this Chapter to "treasurer", "county treasurer" or "county auditor" were amended to refer exclusively to
                    the treasurer appointed as provided in that section. Pursuant to G.S. 156-81.1, the word "county" has been deleted preceding "treasurer" near the beginning of the third sentence of the last paragraph of this section. However, there
                    was no practicable method of changing the proviso at the end of this section to give effect to G.S. 156-81.1.

                        The first sentence of the second paragraph must be read in connection with the provisions of G.S. 156-105 that "the assessments shall constitute a first and paramount lien, second only to State and county taxes upon the lands assessed for the payment
                        of bonds and interest thereon as they become due, and shall be collected in the same manner and by the same officers as State and county taxes are collected;" when so considered, it is clear that this section is not in conflict
                        with G.S. 156-105, but is intended to implement collection of the assessment by the sheriff. Nesbit v. Kafer, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 48</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 903 (1942).

                        County and substituted therefor a depositary and financial agent, to perform the duties of treasurer in disbursement of the county funds. The act further provided that the sheriff, as such, or ex officio treasurer, should turn

                        each class, together with a description of that part of the land as to which the ownership has changed, with the number of acres in each class, and pray the court to order that the assessment roll be amended in accordance with
                        the title and interest of the several owners. At the time of filing the petition a summons shall issue to the other parties interested in the tract of land to show cause, on a day certain, why the prayer of the petition should
                        not be granted. Upon the return day the clerk of the court shall hear all the evidence, find the facts, and enter up a judgment directing the appropriate amendment to the assessment roll. It shall be the duty of the clerk to amend
                        the assessment roll in accordance with his judgment.

                    was made, when the original assessment upon said property has been paid, or shall be paid prior to such general reassessment, nor to the extent that the original assessment has been paid.

                    The auditor for the drainage district will be required to examine the assessment roll and the records and accounts of the sheriff or tax collector as to the assessment roll which went into his hands on the previous first Monday in September and for all
                    previous years as to which the records and accounts of the sheriff or tax collector have not been audited.

                <p>
                    The auditor shall for each of such years make a report as to each drainage district, showing the total amount of drainage assessments due for each year, the amount collected by the sheriff up to the fifteenth day of May of the following year, the names
                    of the owners of land, and a brief description of the lands on which the drainage assessments have not been paid, and the total amount of unpaid drainage assessments, with any further data or information which the auditor may regard

                </p>
                <p>
                    The auditor shall also examine the books of the treasurer for similar years, and he shall report the amount of drainage assessments paid to the treasurer by the sheriff or tax collector for each year, and the amounts paid out by the treasurer during such
                    years, and for what purposes paid. It shall be the duty of the sheriff and treasurer to permit the auditor to examine their official books and records and to furnish all necessary information, and to assist the auditor in the discharge
                    of his duties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The auditor shall make a report to the board of county commissioners on or before the first Monday in July following his appointment, and he shall deliver a duplicate of such report to the chairman of the board of drainage commissioners of each drainage
                    district established in the county.

                    If the sheriff has not collected all of the drainage assessments, or has not paid over all collections to the treasurer, or if the treasurer has not made disbursements of the drainage funds as required by law, or has not in his hands the funds not so
                    disbursed by him, it shall be the duty of the auditor to so report, and to prepare two certified copies of his report, one of which shall be delivered to the judge holding a session of superior court in the county following the first
                    Monday in July, and a copy to the district attorney of the prosecutorial district as defined in G.S. 7A-60 in which the county is located, and it shall be the duty of such district attorney to examine carefully such report and to institute
                    such action, civil or criminal, against the sheriff or tax collector or the treasurer, as the facts contained in the report may justify, or as may be required by law.
