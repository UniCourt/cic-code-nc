        </p>
        <p>
            This Chapter is based upon the Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (hereinafter "Uniform Act") and is the result of a study performed by the General Statutes Commission, partly due to S.L. 2004-161, s. 7.1. The Commission filed its report
            with the General Assembly on May 11, 2006.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     Editor's Note.
    </b> - Session Laws 2006-226, s. 34, makes this Chapter effective January 1, 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
            Session Laws 2006-226, s. 5 is a severability clause.
        </p>
        <p>
            Session Laws 2006-226, s. 6, provides: "This act does not affect an action or proceeding commenced or right accrued before this act takes effect."
        </p>
        <p>
            Session Laws 2006-226, s. 7, provides: "The Revisor of Statutes shall cause to be printed along with this act all relevant portions of the official comments to the Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act and all explanatory comments of the drafters
            of this act as the Revisor deems appropriate."
        </p>
        <p>
            Permission to include the Official Comments was granted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and The American Law Institute. It is believed that the Official Comments will prove of value to the practitioner in understanding
            and applying the text of this Chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Official Comments appearing under individual sections in this Chapter have been printed by the publisher as received, without editorial change, and relate to the Chapter as originally enacted. However, not all sections in this Chapter may carry Official
            Comments. Furthermore, Official Comments may or may not have been received or updated in conjunction with subsequent amendments to this Chapter and, therefore, may not reflect all changes to the sections under which they appear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where they appear in this Chapter, "Amended Comment" usually means that an error in the original comment has been corrected by a subsequent amendment, and "Supplemental Comment" pertains to a later development, such as an amendment to the statute text.
            North Carolina Comments explain where the General Assembly has enacted variations to the text of the Uniform Act.

            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol11">
                With respect to relations external to a nonprofit association, whether a person is a member of the organization determines principally a member's responsibility to third parties. Internally, whether a person is a member might determine specified rights
                and responsibilities, including access to facilities, voting, and obligation to pay dues. This Act is concerned only with determining whether a person is a member for purposes of external relations, such as liabilities to third parties
                on a contract of the nonprofit association. Therefore, "member" is defined in terms appropriate to these purposes. "Member" includes a person who has sufficient right to participate in the affairs of a nonprofit association so that under
                common law the person would be considered a co-principal and so liable for contract and tort obligations of the nonprofit association.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol12">
                A fund-raising device commonly used by many nonprofit organizations is the membership drive. In most cases the contributors are not members for purposes of this Act. They are not authorized to "participate in the selection of persons authorized to manage
                the affairs of the nonprofit association or in the development of policy." Simply because an association calls a person a member does not make the person a member under this Act.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol13">
                The role of a member in the affairs of an association is described as "may participate in the selection" instead of "may select or elect" the governing board and officers and 'may participate ... in the development of policy" instead of "may determine"
                policy. This accommodates the Act to a great variation in practices and organizational structures. For example, some nonprofit associations permit the president or chair to name some members of the governing board, such as by naming the
                chairs of principal committees who are designated ex officio members of the governing board. Similarly, the role in determination of policy is described in general terms. "Persons authorized to manage the affairs of the association" is
                used in the definition instead of president, executive director, officer, member of governing board, and the like. Given the wide variety of organizational structures of nonprofit associations to which this Act applies and the informality
                of some of them the more generic term is more appropriate.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol14">
                "Person" instead of individual is used to make it clear that associations covered by this Act may have individuals, corporations, and other legal entities as members. Unincorporated nonprofit trade associations, for example, commonly have corporations
                as members. Some national and regional associations of local government officials and agencies have governmental units or agencies as members.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol15">
                Paragraph (2) defines "nonprofit association." The model American Bar Association acts deal with both for-profit and nonprofit corporations. Unincorporated, for-profit organizations are largely covered by the uniform partnership acts. The differences
                between for-profit and nonprofit unincorporated organizations are so significant that it would be impractical to cover both in a single act. Therefore, this Act deals only with nonprofit organizations.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol16">
                A charitable trust is a form of an unincorporated nonprofit legal organization. It is, however, not a nonprofit association within this Act. To the extent that trust law does not supply an answer to a legal problem concerning a charitable trust, a court
                could look to this Act to develop by analogy a common law answer.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol17">
                The term "nonprofit association" is used instead of "association" for several reasons. The risk that this Act when placed in a state's code would be construed to apply to both nonprofit and for-profit associations should thus be avoided. Acts dealing
                with one kind of association when placed in a code have sometimes lost their identification and been inadvertently applied to the other kind where the term "association" alone was used. For example, the New York Joint-Stock Association
                Act of 1894 used the term "association," which it defined to include only for-profit organizations. "Association" was held in 1938 to include an unincorporated political party and the act applied to it. Richmond County v. Democratic Organization
                of Richmond County, 1 NYS 2d 349 (1938). Subsequent decisions applied the act to other unincorporated nonprofit organizations. The use of "nonprofit association" instead of merely "association" should also avoid the risk of this Act being
                improperly used to develop a common law rule by analogy from this Act to apply in a case involving a for-profit association. Roscoe Pound, Common Law and Legislation, 21 Harv. L. Rev. 383 (1908); Robert F. Williams, Statutes as Sources
                of Law Beyond their Terms in Common Law Cases, 50 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 554 (1982).Legal issues concerning unincorporated for-profit associations that are not partnerships and so not controlled by a partnership act would be governed by a
                State's other statutory or common law. Resort to one of the two partnership acts for the purposes of developing a common law rule by analogy would be appropriate. Resort for this purpose to this Act in the case of an unincorporated for-profit
                association would not be appropriate.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol18">
                Two or more persons is the common statutory requirement to constitute an unincorporated nonprofit association. New Jersey, on the other hand, requires that there be seven or more members to be an association under its laws. This Act suggests the smaller
                number - two. Consideration was given to specifying "one" instead of "two." For example, the developer of a condominium may have created a condominium association as an unincorporated nonprofit association. Before any units are sold the
                developer as owner of all units has all of the memberships in the association. Should it be treated as a nonprofit association under this Act from the beginning? It should not. Can one person be "joined by mutual consent for a common purpose?"
                To ask the question would seem to be to answer it. If the concern is to give the developer the entity protections provided by this Act, it is very likely that it already has some protection because it is a business corporation. Nevertheless,
                the number is placed in brackets, in part, to raise the question whether the number should be one or two or even a larger number.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol19">
                "Nonprofit" is not defined. A common definition - it is an association whose net gains do not inure to the benefit of its members and which makes no distribution to its members, except on dissolution - does not work for all nonprofit associations. Consumer
                cooperatives, for example, make distributions to their members; but they are not for-profit organizations. Those consumer cooperatives not organized under specific state or federal laws need the benefits of this Act.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol110">
                The final sentence of paragraph (2) is adapted from Section 201(d)(1) of Uniform Partnership Act (1994). This stresses that more than common ownership and use is required. For example, that three families own a lake cottage and share its use does not
                make the three families a nonprofit association. Paragraph (2) precludes arrangements that are merely common ownership from being a nonprofit association under this Act.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol111">
                The definition of "person" in paragraph (3) is a standard NCCUSL definition.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-2-officialcommentol112">
                The definition of "State" in paragraph (4) is a standard NCCUSL definition.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The definition may reach somewhat beyond decisions of some courts. Either participation in the selection of the leadership or in the development of policy is enough. Both are not required. This broad definition of member ensures that the insulation from
            liability is provided in all cases in which the common law might have imposed liability on a person, simply because the person was a member.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 6 [G.S. 59B-7] nevertheless protects "a person considered to be a member by a nonprofit association" even though the person is not within the definition of member in paragraph (1) [see North Carolina Comment to G.S. 59B-7].
        </p>
        <p>
            The members must be joined together for a common purpose. Several States provide that they be "joined together for a
            <b>
     stated
    </b> common purpose" (emphasis added). Because of the informality of many ad hoc associations, it is prudent not to impose the requirement that the common purpose be "stated." Very probably, it is the small, informal, ad hoc associations
            and those third parties affected by them that most need this Act.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is instructive to note that the drafting committee for the ABA Model Nonprofit Corporation Act finally determined that it could not develop a satisfactory definition of nonprofit. Instead, the act contains rules, regulations, and procedures applicable
            separately to each of the three kinds of nonprofit corporation - public benefit, mutual benefit, and religious. It does not define the three kinds; it described what they can do and how they may function. Considering the corporation's intended
            activities and the rules, regulations, and procedures applicable to each of the three different kinds of corporations, a choice is made. Having made a choice, the corporation is bound by the rules, regulations, and procedures prescribed for
            the kind of nonprofit corporation chosen.

                This Act contains no rules concerning governance. However, recourse to rules of governance must be had to apply some of the Act's rules. For example, whether a nonprofit association is liable under a contract made for it by an individual depends on whether
                the individual had the necessary authority to act as agent. Was the individual given the authority by someone empowered by the nonprofit association to give the authority? To decide a case like this a court must resort to the rules of
                the nonprofit association or, if there are none applicable or none at all, to the common law or other statutory law of the jurisdiction.

                Efforts were made to develop default internal rules of governance - applicable if an association had none or none that were applicable. This effort demonstrated the complexity and difficulty of fashioning rules that would reasonably fit a wide variety
                of nonprofit associations - large and small, public benefit, mutual benefit, and religious, and of short and indefinite duration. It was thought best to leave this question to other law of the jurisdiction.

                Subsection (a) makes a nonprofit association a legal entity separate from its members for purposes of its dealing with real and personal property. This reverses the common law view that a non-profit association was not a legal entity.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-5-officialcommentol12">
                Subsection (b) is based on Section 3-102(8), Uniform Common Interest Act. It reverses the common law rule. Inasmuch as an unincorporated nonprofit association was not a legal entity at common law, it could not acquire, hold, or convey real or personal
                property. Harold J. Ford, Unincorporated Non-Profit Associations, 1-45 (Oxford Univ. Press (1959); 15 A.L.R. 2d 1451 (1951); Warburton, The Holding of Property by Unincorporated Associations, Conveyancer 318 (September-October 1985).
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-5-officialcommentol13">
                This strict common law rule has been modified in various ways in most jurisdictions by courts and statutes. For example, courts have held that a gift by will or inter vivos transfer of real property to a nonprofit association is not effective to vest
                title in the nonprofit association but is effective to vest title in the officers of the association to hold as trustees for the members of the association. Matter of Anderson's Estate, 571 P. 2d 880 (Okla. App. 1977).
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-5-officialcommentol14">
                Even if a nonprofit association's governing documents provide that it "may not acquire real property," subsection (b) makes effective a transfer of Blackacre to the association. A different result would obviously disrupt real estate titles. The remedy
                for this violation of internal rules lies not in preventing title from passing but, as with other organizations, in an action by members against their association and its appropriate officers to undo the transaction.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-5-officialcommentol15">
                Subsection (c) is a necessary corollary of subsection (b) and, thus, it may be unnecessary. However, several States expressly provide that an unincorporated, nonprofit association may be a legatee, devisee, or beneficiary. See, for example, Md. Estates
                &amp; Trusts Code Ann. Section 4-301 (1991). Therefore, it is desirable to continue this as an express rule. Subsection (c) applies to both trusts and contracts. Not all state statutes apply expressly to both.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            A New York statute specifies that a grant by will of real or personal property to an unincorporated association is effective if within three years after probate of the will the association incorporates. McKinney's N.Y. Estates, Powers, &amp; Trust Law,
            Section 3-1.3 (1981).
        </p>
        <p>
            California gives any "unincorporated society or association and every lodge or branch of any such association, and any labor organization" full right to acquire, hold, or transfer any "real estate and other property as may be necessary for the business
            purposes and objects of the society," and acquire and hold any property not so necessary for 10 years. California Corporations Code, Title 3, Unincorporated Associations, Section 20001 (West 1991).
        </p>
        <p>
            As is the case with many of the problems created by the view that an unincorporated association is not an entity the statutory solutions are often partial - limited to special circumstances and associations. Subsection (b) solves this problem for all
            nonprofit associations, for all kinds of transactions, and for both real and personal property.

                A statement of authority need not be filed to conclude an acquisition of or to hold real property. It is concerned only with the sale, lease, encumbrance, and other transfer of an estate or interest in real property. For this, it should, but need not,

                Inasmuch as the statement relates to the authority of a person to act for the association in transferring real property, subsection (b) requires that the statement be filed or recorded in the officer where a transfer of the real property would be filed
                or recorded. This is usually the county in which the real estate is situated. This is where a title search concerning the real estate would be conducted. Uniform Partnership Act (1994) Section 303 provides for central filing, such as with
                the Secretary of State, but its statement of partnership authority concerns authority of partners generally, not just with respect to real estate.

                Subsection (c)(2) [not enacted in North Carolina] deals with the problem caused by the similarity of names of small local nonprofit associations. There is no duplication of federal tax identification numbers. Therefore, any confusion of identity is avoided

                Subsection (c)(5) permits the statement to identify as the person who can act for the association one who holds a particular office, such as president. This designation relieves the association from the need to make additional filings on each change of
                officers. Under local title standards and practices the transferee and filing or recording office are likely to require a certificate of incumbency if the statement designates the holder of an office.

                Subsection (g) is based on Uniform Partnership Act (1994) Section 303(h). Its obvious purpose is to protect good faith purchasers for value without notice who rely on the statement, including those who acquire a security interest in the real property.
                If the required signatures on the statement, deed, or both are forgeries, the effect of them is not governed by Section 5(g). Instead, Section 2 applies and would invoke the other law of the State. In many States the deed would be a nullity.

        <p>
            The General Statutes Commission inserted "of the register of deeds" in subsection (b) to identify the office in which a transfer of real property would be recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Commission made several changes in subsection (c). To assist the registers of deeds, the Commission modified the introductory language of the subsection by requiring a statement of authority to be set out in a document entitled "affidavit." The Commission
            deleted subdivision (2) (the Uniform Act's requirement for a federal tax identification number) due to concerns over identity theft and the belief that the requirement was not useful in any event. In subdivision (3), the Commission conformed
            the requirement for an address, in part, to similar requirements in this State's statutes regulating other entities. In subdivision (5), the Commission changed "title" to "office" in light of the references to "officer" in subsection (g) and
            G.S. 59B-13. The Commission added subdivision (6).
        </p>
        <p>
            The Commission modified subsection (d) by requiring a statement of authority to be sworn to and subscribed in the same manner as an affidavit and by narrowing the subsection to specify execution by a "member or agent" rather than a "person."
        </p>
        <p>
            In subsection (e), the Commission identified the officer authorized to collect the fee for recording a statement of authority, made the collection of the fee mandatory rather than permissive, inserted the cross-reference to the recording fee "authorized
            by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.161.html#t161a01s161-10ol1a1" target="_blank">G.S. 161-10(a)(1)</a></cite>," and added indexing instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In subsection (f), the Commission replaced the Uniform Act's references to "cancellation," "cancelled," and "is cancelled" with "termination," "terminated," and "expires."
        </p>
        <p>
            In subsection (g), the Commission inserted the reference to the "register of deeds" to identify the office in which a transfer of real property would be recorded and added "or officer" for more precision.

            Controlling Effect of G.S. 1-69.1. - This section was enacted in 1939. The amendment to G.S. 1-69.1, which added the requirement of an allegation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.066.html#t66a14s66-68" target="_blank">G.S. 66-68</a></cite>            (repealed) recordation before suit may be brought by an unincorporated association in its common name, was enacted effective 1 October 1975. In the face of any irreconcilable conflict between the provisions of these two statutes, G.S. 1-69.1,
            being the later enactment, will control or be regarded as a qualification of the earlier statute. Cherokee Home Demonstration Club v. Oxendine, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 397 S.E.2d 643 (1990).

                At common law a nonprofit association was not a legal entity separate from its members. Borrowing from the law of partnership, the common law viewed a nonprofit association as an aggregate of its members. The members are co-principals. Subsection (a)
                changes that. It makes a nonprofit association a legal entity separate from its members for purposes of contract and tort.

            <li id="t59Bs59B-7-officialcommentol12">
                This Act does not deal with liability of members or other persons acting for a nonprofit association for their own conduct. With respect to contract and tort Section 6 leaves that to the other law of the jurisdiction enacting this Act.

            <li id="t59Bs59B-7-officialcommentol13">
                Subsections (b) through (e) are applications to common cases of the basic principle in subsection (a). Because a nonprofit association is made a separate legal entity, its members are not co-principals. Consequently they are not liable on contracts or
                for torts for which the association is liable. Subsection (b) specifies that result with respect to contracts.

                Subsections (a) and (b) eliminate a risk that existed under common law. An agent makes an implied warranty of authority to the other contracting party. If the purported principal does not exist, the agent obviously breaches the warranty. Because an unincorporated
                nonprofit association was not a legal entity; one purporting to act for it breached this implied warranty. Smith &amp; Edwards v. Golden Spike Little League, 577 P. 2d 132, 134 (Utah 1978). Subsection (b) treats a nonprofit association
                as a legal entity; therefore, an agent who acts for it within her authority does not breach the warranty.

            <b>
     "Merely"
    </b> because a person is a member does not make the person liable on an association's contract. This formulation means that there are special circumstances that may result in liability. For example, a member may expressly become a party
            to a contract with the nonprofit association. Subsection (b) relieves members only of their vicarious liability. Liability for one's own conduct is left to the other law of the jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
            An agent with authority from a nonprofit association who negotiates a contract without disclosing the agent's representative status is liable on the contract. Under agency law an agent acting within the agent's scope of authority for an undisclosed or
            partially disclosed principal is personally liable on the contract along with the principal, unless the other contracting party agrees not to hold the agent liable. Restatement (Second) Of Agency 320-322; Reuschlein and Gregory,

            Courts have pierced the corporate veil of nonprofit corporations. Comment, Piercing the Nonprofit Corporation Veil, 66 Marq. L. Rev. 134 (1984). Section 6 makes a nonprofit association a legal entity for these purposes. Therefore, as a matter of its other
            law a jurisdiction enacting this Act may appropriately apply this doctrine to a nonprofit association. In
            <i>
     Macaluso v. Jenkins
    </i> , 95 Ill. App. 3d 461, 420 N.E.2d 251 (1981), the president of a nonprofit corporation was found to have so commingled its funds and assets with his own and those of a business corporation he controlled and have treated them as his
            own for his benefit that the corporate veil must be pierced to promote justice. He was found liable for a debt contracted in the name of the nonprofit corporation. See also Harry G. Henn &amp; John R. Alexander,

            7. An example of a partial statutory solution of members' liability for contracts of a nonprofit association is California Corporations Code, Title 3, Nonprofit Associations, Section 21100 (West 1991). It relieves members from liability for "debts or
            liabilities contracted or incurred by the association in the acquisition of lands or leases or the purchase, leasing, designing, planning, architectural supervision, erection, contraction, repair, or furnishing of buildings or other structures,
            to be used for purposes of the association." As noted earlier, partial and uncoordinated statutory solutions of common law problems are typical.
        </p>
        <p>
            8. Subsection (c) [combined in this section into subsection (b)] applies the principle in subsection (a) to relieve members and others from liability for torts for which the nonprofit association is liable. Inasmuch as Section 6 [this section] provides
            that a member is not a co-principal, the member cannot be considered to be an employer of the employee who committed the tort. Again, only relief from vicarious liability is provided.
        </p>
        <p>
            Liability of a member or other person who acts for the nonprofit association is governed by other law of the jurisdiction. That an employer is liable for a tort committed by its employee does not excuse the employee.
        </p>
        <p>
            9. The immunity from vicarious liability provided by subsections (b) and (c) [combined in this section into subsection (b)] does not depend on the remedy sought. Whether it is for damages for breach of contract or tort, unjust enrichment, or the like
            the immunity is provided.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. Since the mid 1980's all States have enacted laws providing officers, board members, and other volunteers some protection from liability for their own negligence. The statutes vary greatly as to who is covered, for what conduct protection is given,
            and the conditions imposed for the freedom from liability. Some apply only to nonprofit corporations. State Liability Laws for Charitable Organizations and Volunteers (Nonprofit Risk Management &amp; Insurance Institute, 1990); Developments,
            Nonprofit Corporations, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 1578, 1685-1696 (1992). This means that members and volunteers involved with unincorporated nonprofit associations do not obtain protection under those state statutes."
        </p>
        <p>
            The 1987 Texas act, for example, relieves directors, officers, and other volunteers from liability for simple negligence that causes death, damage, or injury if the volunteer acted in the scope of her duties for a charitable organization exempt under
            Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) or (4). The act also limits the amounts that may be recovered from an employee or the organization if the organization carries requisite liability insurance. The constitutionality of the provision relieving
            volunteers from liability has been questioned under Article I, Section 13 of the Texas Constitution - the Open Courts provision. Note, The Constitutionality of the Charitable Immunity and Liability Act 1987, 40 Baylor L. Rev. 657 (1988). Some
            statutes premise all relief upon the organization having specified liability insurance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 6 [this section] does not affect these statutes. As noted earlier Section 6 [this section] deals only with vicarious liability. These statutes concern liability for one's own conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
            11. Although not a concern of Section 6 [this section], perhaps it should be noted that nonprofit organizations have been held liable for tortious acts and omissions not only of employees but also of members. In Guyton v. Howard, 525 So. 2d 918 (Fl. App.
            1988) a nonprofit organization was held liable for the negligence of members who acted for the organization in conducting an initiation that resulted in injury.
        </p>
        <p>
            12. Subsection (d) applies the principle in subsection (a) to reverse the common law rule that the negligence of an employee of an association is imputed to its members. A member as co-principal was vicariously responsible for an employee's conduct within
            the scope of the employee's duties. Section 6, however, makes the nonprofit association a legal entity. Thus, a member is not a co-principal and the employee's negligence is not imputed to a member.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because the employee's negligence is not imputed, the member's suit against the nonprofit association for negligence by the employee is not subject to the defense of contributory negligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some courts treated large nonprofit associations as entities for some purposes and so did not impute the negligence of an employee to a member. Therefore, a member could recover from the association.
            <i>
     Marshall v. International Longshoreman's and Warehouseman's Union
    </i> , 57 Cal. 2d 781, 371 p. 2d 987 (1962); Judson A. Crane,
            <i>
     Liability of an Unincorporated Association for Tortious Injury to a Member
    </i> , 16 Vand L Rev 319, 323 (1963).
        </p>
        <p>
            13. Subsection (e) applies the principle in subsection (a) to reverse the common law rule that a member may not sue the member's unincorporated nonprofit association. A member as co-principal is logically a defendant as well as a plaintiff in such an
            action. The logic is that one may not sue oneself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subsection (a) makes an unincorporated nonprofit a legal entity. Therefore, a member is separate from the nonprofit association. There is thus no logical obstacle to either suing the other. A nonprofit association may, for example, sue a member for delinquent
            dues. See, for example, Section 6.13 ABA Nonprofit Corporation Act (1987)
        </p>
        <p>
            14. The Texas Supreme Court recently overruled the common law rule and held that a member may sue the unincorporated nonprofit association of which the person is a member.
            <i>
     Cox v. Thee Evergreen Church
    </i> , 836 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. 1992). The court also overturned the Texas common law rule that the negligence of an employee is imputed to a member. The court referred to a statute authorizing a nonprofit association to sue and be sued and
            other Texas statutes giving entity status for limited purposes to unincorporated nonprofit associations. It did not, however, rely on them in overturning the historic common law rule. It simply found the old rule not suitable for present times.
            The court also followed recent developments in other courts.
        </p>
        <p>
            15. Section 6 [this section] relieves from vicarious liability not only members but also certain others. Persons who are "authorized to participate in the management of the affairs of the nonprofit association" are protected. Persons within this group
            - largely directors and officers, however denominated - are likely also to be members as defined in Section 1(1) [G.S. 59B-2(1)], and protected as such. If they are not members (i.e., not co-principals) they should not be found liable at common
            law. Section 6 [this section] extends protection to this group out of abundant caution. It is possible that a court might misapply the common law rationale for liability to hold a non-member manager vicariously liable. Section 6 [this section]
            prevents that somewhat remote possibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 6 [this section] also extends protection to a person who is not within the definition of "member" in Section 1(1) [G.S. 59B-2(1)] but is "considered to be a member by the nonprofit association." [see North Carolina Comment.] A person within this
            clause is one who does not have the relationship to the nonprofit association that would permit a finding under the common law that the person is a co-principal. Also the person is not a director, officer, or manager within the preceding phrase.
            That a person not within the two preceding phrases but within the third phrase might be found vicariously liable seems quite remote. Nevertheless, Section 6 [this section] accords this person protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            As noted earlier, Section 6 [this section] concerns vicarious liability only. Liability for one's own conduct is covered by other law of the enacting jurisdiction.
        </p>

     NORTH CAROLINA COMMENT
    </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Uniform Act in this section provides protection for a nonprofit association's members from tort and contract liability based solely on membership status. The General Statutes Commission extended this protection to cover liability based solely on membership
            status for the nonprofit association's other legal obligations, such as taxes and penalties. The Commission restructured the section in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout this section, the Commission substituted the phrase "person referred to as a member" for the Uniform Act's phrase "person considered to be a member" to eliminate possible ambiguity created by the use of the word "consider." As the Official
            Comment makes clear, the phrase was intended to refer to persons who do not meet the definition of "member" but are referred to by the nonprofit association as "members" to recognize their contributions (such as a financial donation) to the
            association.
        </p>
        <p>
            In subsection (e), the Commission expanded the Uniform Act's provision by changing "a claim against the nonprofit association" to "a claim against or on behalf of the nonprofit association."

                Subsection (a) broadly recognizes the right of a nonprofit association to participate as an entity in judicial, administrative, and governmental proceedings, and in arbitration and mediation on behalf of it and its members. It may sue and be sued. Many
                States have enacted statutes granting unincorporated associations these rights. Many have rejected the argument that these acts made an unincorporated nonprofit association a separate legal entity for other purposes.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-8-officialcommentol12">
                Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Section 1745.01 (Baldwin 1991) provides that an unincorporated association may "sue or be sued as an entity under the name by which it is commonly known and called." This formulation has an element that subsection (a) does not have
                - a description of the association name to be used. Maryland requires that the unincorporated association have a "group name." Md. Estates &amp; Trust Code Ann. Section 6-406(a) - (1991). As some of the informal nonprofit associations
                may not have fixed on a name but need the benefit of the rule, subsection (a) does not require that it have a name.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-8-officialcommentol13">
                Subsection (b) describes an association's standing to represent the interests of its members in the proceeding. It is the federal standing rule. Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commn, 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S. Ct. 2434, 53, L. Ed. 2d 383 (1977). A
                nonprofit association must meet the three requirements only if it seeks to represent the interest of its members. If the suit concerns only the nonprofit association's interests, subsection (b) does not apply.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-8-officialcommentol14">
                If participation of individual members is required, the nonprofit association does not have standing. If the injury for which a claim is made or the remedy sought is different for different members, their participation through testimony and presenting
                other evidence is required. The typical case in which a nonprofit association has standing is where it seeks only a declaration, injunction, or some form of prospective relief for injury to its members. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 515,
                95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975).

            <li id="t59Bs59B-8-officialcommentol15">
                Subsection (b) does not require the nonprofit association to show that it suffered harm or has some interest to protect to have standing to represent the interests of its members. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975).
                Some States require an association to have an interest to protect which is separate from that of its members. One court found that the probable loss of members if it did not take action on their behalf was a sufficient interest to protect
                to give it standing to represent its members. This approach certainly diminishes greatly the burden of satisfying the requirement. States have further modified the old standing rule. Recently many States have adopted the three-pronged
                federal rule, which is the rule in subsection (b).

                Section 9 [this section] is not a dissolution rule. An inactive nonprofit association may not be one that has dissolved. It may have just stopped functioning and have taken no formal steps to dissolve. It might possibly be revived.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-10-officialcommentol12">
                "Inactive" is not defined. A nonprofit association that has accomplished its purpose, such as seeking approval in a school bond election, is very likely inactive. A nonprofit association that has stopped pursuing its purposes, collecting dues, holding
                elections of officers and board members, and conducting meetings, and has no employees would seem to be inactive.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-10-officialcommentol13">
                Section 9 [this section] applies only to personal property - tangible and intangible. Unclaimed property acts also apply to both kinds of personal property. All States have some form of unclaimed property act. Therefore, the relationship of these acts
                to this Act must be examined.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-10-officialcommentol14">
                It is the custody of and not the title to the property that is transferred. To whatever purpose the property was dedicated while in the hands of the transferor, it remains so dedicated in the hands of the transferee. Identification of the persons to whom
                the property may be transferred and cy pres principles recognize that the purpose to which the transferee may put the property need not be precisely that to which it was initially dedicated. For example, the initial purpose may no longer
                be viable.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-10-officialcommentol15">
                Section 9 [this section] does not address what should be done with real property of an inactive nonprofit association. This seems justified. A nonprofit association owning real property of significant value is unlikely to become inactive. In the rare
                case that it does, the assistance of a court may be obtained in making appropriate disposition of the real property, primarily to ensure good title.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-10-officialcommentol16">
                To obtain a Section 501(c)(3) tax classification as a nonprofit association an association must specify a distribution of assets on dissolution that satisfies the Internal Revenue Code. To avoid the interpretation that Section 9 might be construed to
                override an approved distribution provision in an association's governing document the primacy of that distribution provision is expressly recognized in paragraph (1).
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-10-officialcommentol17">
                If there is no bylaw or other controlling document the person may transfer the custody of the personal property to another nonprofit organization or a government or governmental entity. The nonprofit organization need not have the same nonprofit purpose
                as the inactive one. It is enough that the transferee's purpose is "broadly similar." This requirement should not be construed narrowly. Otherwise, the risk of potential litigation over the transferor's choice will frustrate the section's
                purpose to provide a safe harbor.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-10-officialcommentol18">
                Inasmuch as the transfer is made without consideration and the association almost certainly rendered insolvent, creditors of a nonprofit association would be protected by the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act Sections 4(a) and 5 [G.S. 39-23.4(a) and G.S.
                39-23.5] and similar statutes. Whether they would also be protected if the transfer is made to the administrator of an unclaimed property statute depends on the terms of a jurisdiction's act. Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1981) Sections
                20 and 24 contemplate that a creditor may proceed against property in the hands of the administrator if the creditor claims an interest in the property, such as a security interest or judgment lien. It is less clear that Section 15 of
                the 1995 Act recognizes this action. However, a general creditor without some claim against the property would not be protected. It is unlikely that an inactive nonprofit association would have both unpaid creditors and a significant amount
                of property. Therefore, the two issues discussed above are unlikely to arise.
            </li>
            <li id="t59Bs59B-10-officialcommentol19">
                The person in possession or control is not required to give notice of the proposed transfer to anyone. An examination of to whom notice might reasonably be given reveals the difficulty with such a requirement. Almost by definition an inactive nonprofit
                association has no current members.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Section 9 [this section] gives a person in possession or control of personal property of a nonprofit association an opportunity to be relieved of responsibility for it. Compliance with the section provides a safe harbor.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Inactive" does not describe a nonprofit association whose sole purpose is to act should a specific problem arise. That there has been no activity because the problem has not arisen does not make the standby organization "inactive."
        </p>
        <p>
            A three year period of inactivity is suggested. It is unlikely that a nonprofit association that has been inactive for that period will begin functioning again. Thus, it is prudent to transfer custody of its assets to someone likely to make appropriate
            use of them. While it is unlikely that a nonprofit association would deal with this issue, if its document does provide a shorter or longer period, that period governs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) applies to certain intangible and tangible personal property. If the property has been unclaimed by the owner for five or more years it is presumed abandoned. Intangible property, such as checking and savings
            accounts and uncollected dividends, is the main concern of these Acts. The obligor, such as a bank or other financial institution and corporation, is directed to report and turn over the property to the state administrator.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only tangible personal property to which the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) applies, according to Section 3, is that in "a safe deposit box or any other safekeeping repository." Many States have additional statutes that apply to property abandoned
            in airport, bus, and railroad lockers and the like. Tangible personal property of an inactive nonprofit association in the control or possession of a member or other person is not likely to be in these places. Therefore, overlap of this Act
            with the other state acts with respect to tangible personal property is likely to be very limited.
        </p>
        <p>
            Property of an inactive nonprofit association is likely to be in the possession or control of a former member, board member, officer, or employee. Especially with respect to intangible property, their relation to the property is unlike that of those regulated
            by the unclaimed property acts. They are custodians or fiduciaries and not obligors. Those upon whom duties are imposed by the unclaimed property acts are obligors on such intangible property as bank accounts, money orders, life insurance
            policies, and utility deposits. The person acting under Section 9 is very unlikely to be in the position of an obligor on such intangible property. In summary, there appears to be limited overlap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other special statutes may apply, such as laws governing unexpended campaign funds. Texas, for example, permits a person to retain political contributions for six years after the person is no longer an office-holder or candidate. It gives the person six
            choices of transferees, including a "recognized tax exempt charitable organization formed for educational, religious or scientific purposes." Tex. Code Ann. Elections Section 251.012(d) and (e) (Vernon's 1986). Minnesota provides that if an
            unincorporated religious society "ceases to exist or to maintain its organization" title to its real and personal property vests in the "next higher governing or supervisory" body of the same denomination. Minn. Stat. Ann. Section 315.37 (West
            1992).
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no limitation with respect to the choice of a government or governmental entity.

            The General Statutes Commission modified this section in subsection (a) by adding the reference to "notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served on a nonprofit association." In subsection (b), the Commission deleted the Uniform Act's requirement
            for a federal tax identification number due to concerns over identity theft and the belief that the requirement was not useful in any event and conformed the requirement for an address, in part, to similar requirements for the statutes regulating
            other entities. The Commission modified subsection (c) by requiring that the agent give "written" notice of the agent's resignation to the nonprofit association "at its last known address." The Commission also added subsections (d) and (e)
            and substituted a fee schedule for the Uniform Act's fee provision. The filing fees in subsection (f) are the same as those for similar documents filed by nonprofit corporations and business entities.

        <p>
            This provision reverses the common law rule of partnerships, which courts often extended to unincorporated nonprofit associations. Uniform Partnership Act (1994) Sections 29 and 31(4). This Act's entity approach requires this change of the old common
            law rule. Similar provisions are found in many state statutes. See, for example, Ohio Rev. Code Ann., Corporations, Section 1745.04 (Baldwin 1991); Md. Ann. Code art. 6-406(a)(2); and 12 Vt. Stat. Ann. Section 815 (Equity Pub. 1973). Uniform
            Partnership Act (1994) adopts an entity approach and so changes the old rule. See Sections 603(a) 701, and 801 of 1994 Act.

     § 59B-13. Venue.

        </h3>
        <p>
            For purposes of venue, a nonprofit association is a resident of a county in which it has an office or maintains a place of operation or, if on due inquiry no office or place of operation can be found, in which any officer resides.

                Venue, unlike service of process, is treated by statute. See for example Mont. Code Ann. Section 25-2-118(1) (1991); 28 USCA1391. A criterion used by all States for fixing venue is the county of residence of the defendant. Most States specify as many
                as eight additional grounds for venue, including the county in which the real estate that is the subject of the suit is situated and the county in which the act causing, in whole or in part, the personal injury or other tort occurred.
                None of these additional criteria present a special problem with respect to an unincorporated nonprofit association.

                If an aggregate view of a nonprofit association were taken, the association is resident in any county in which a member resides. See Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper, 15 Federal Procedure &amp; Practice 3812 (1986). Conforming to the entity view of an association,
                Section 12 rejects the common law view.

            <li id="t59Bs59B-13-officialcommentol13">
                Section 12 [this section] makes a nonprofit association a resident of any county . . . in which it has an office. If it has an office in five counties, for example, it may be sued in any of the five counties.
            </li>

            This section is bracketed because some States have already satisfactorily solved this problem.

            States have by statute modified the common law rule. Illinois, for example, provides that "a voluntary unincorporated association sued in its own name is a resident of any county in which it has an office or if on due inquiry no office can be found, in
            which any officer resides." Ill. Code Civ. Prac. Section 2-102(c).
