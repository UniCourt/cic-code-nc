     CASE NOTES
    </b>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Harassment Could Not Support Civil No-Contact Order. - Finding that a blogger had harassed the victims under G.S. 50C-1(6) and (7) by knowingly publishing electronic or computerized transmissions directed at the victims that tormented, terrorized, or
            terrified the victims and served no legitimate purpose could not support a civil no-contact order, even though the correct definition of harassment under G.S. 14-277.3(c) [now G.S. 14-277.3A] was used. Ramsey v. Harman, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite>            146, 661 S.E.2d 924 (2008).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Harassment Supported No-Contact Order. - Neighbors' conduct in beating on the victim's door, following the victim in her car, and implicitly threatening vandalism to her carport after the victim reported the neighbor to the police constituted unlawful
            conduct sufficient for the issuance of a no-contact order under G.S. 50C-1 and G.S. 50C-5. Such behavior constituted intimidating a witness in a pending criminal case, in violation of G.S. 14-226(a). St. John v. Brantley,
            <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 558, 720 S.E.2d 754 (2011).
        </p>
        <p>
            trial court properly found that defendant has caused plaintiff substantial emotional distress under G.S. 50C-1(6) where over the course of five years, defendant made frequent contact with plaintiff in person, screaming derogatory language at her, he involved
            law enforcement by making false reports to the county sheriff's department, and physically threatened plaintiff by charging a moving vehicle at her. Norrell v. Keely, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 441, - S.E.2d - (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Civil No-Contact Order Improper. - Civil no-contact order was improperly entered for stalking under G.S. 50C-1(6) since there was no evidence that a blogger intended to cause and caused the victims to suffer substantial emotional distress as: (1) the
            trial court found that the messages on a website did not contain language "threatening to inflict bodily harm" or "physical injury"; (2) a claim that a child became "embarrassed" when the child had allegedly observed teachers viewing the blogger's
            website in the school library was implausible; (3) the blogger never had any communication with the victim or the child, and the child's name was not mentioned on the website; and (4) the blog was posted in retaliation for messages posted
            by the victim on a rival website, and an alleged threatening phone call from the victim's mother. Ramsey v. Harman, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 146, 661 S.E.2d 924 (2008).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court exceeded its authority because it had no authority to order defendant not to possess or purchase any firearms, to surrender his firearms, or to revoke his concealed carry permit; neither the complaint nor the ex parte no-contact order mentioned
            firearms, so defendant had no notice of the possibility of an order requiring surrender, and since the trial court imposed the provision after the hearing, sua sponte, neither party had an opportunity to address it at the hearing or to object.
            Russell v. Wofford, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 816 S.E.2d 909 (2018).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     Order Improperly Issued.
    </b> - Trial court erred in entering an ex parte Temporary No-Contact Order against defendant because it failed to make any finding that defendant specifically intended to cause any of the harm set forth in subsection (6), and such a finding
            had to be specifically made, not inferred; even if an intent finding could be inferred, it would still fail because two minor teenagers with learning and processing issues mutually exchanged disturbing communications during a volatile yet
            consensual relationship. Diprima v. Vann, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (May 18, 2021).

     CASE NOTES

        </h4>
        <p>
            Authority of Trial Court. - Trial court exceeded its authority because it had no authority to order defendant not to possess or purchase any firearms, to surrender his firearms, or to revoke his concealed carry permit; neither the complaint nor the ex
            parte no-contact order mentioned firearms, so defendant had no notice of the possibility of an order requiring surrender, and since the trial court imposed the provision after the hearing, sua sponte, neither party had an opportunity to address
            it at the hearing or to object. Russell v. Wofford, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 816 S.E.2d 909 (2018).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Fines. - When a contemnor was found in contempt for violating a no-contact order, a fine was an authorized sanction because, reading G.S. 5A-21, 50C-10, 5A-25, and 50C-5 together, the statutes supported the inference that fines were authorized. Tyll v.
            Berry, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 758 S.E.2d 411 (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Civil Contempt. - Proceedings to hold a contemnor in contempt for violating a no-contact order were in civil contempt because (1) the proceedings were initiated pursuant to civil contempt statutes, (2) the order finding the contemnor in contempt included
            civil contempt findings and a "purge" clause, and (3) construing the order as a civil contempt order was consistent with G.S. 50C-10 and G.S. 5A-25's default civil contempt rule. Tyll v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite>            96, 758 S.E.2d 411 (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Order Properly Issued. - Neighbors' conduct in beating on the victim's door, following the victim in her car, and implicitly threatening vandalism to her carport after the victim reported the neighbor to the police constituted unlawful conduct sufficient
            for the issuance of a no-contact order under G.S. 50C-1 and G.S. 50C-5. Such behavior constituted intimidating a witness in a pending criminal case, in violation of G.S. 14-226(a). St. John v. Brantley, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite>            558, 720 S.E.2d 754 (2011).

                be renewed. If the motion for extension is uncontested and the complainant seeks no modification of the order, the order may be extended if the complainant's motion or affidavit states that there has been no material change in relevant

            such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require.

            No-Contact Order Appeal Moot. - Appellate court determined that the first neighbor's appeal of the trial court's issuance of the civil no-contact order entered against the first neighbor had to be dismissed, as the order had expired five months before
            the appeal of it had been calendared to be heard before the appellate court, and thus the matter was moot because no effective relief could be granted. Williams v. Vonderau, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 638 S.E.2d

            Contempt Fine. - When a contemnor was found in contempt for violating a no-contact order, a fine was an authorized sanction because, reading G.S. 5A-21, 50C-10, 5A-25, and 50C-5 together, the statutes supported the inference that fines were authorized.

            Civil Contempt. - Proceedings to hold a contemnor in contempt for violating a no-contact order were in civil contempt because (1) the proceedings were initiated pursuant to civil contempt statutes, (2) the order finding the contemnor in contempt included
            civil contempt findings and a "purge" clause, and (3) construing the order as a civil contempt order was consistent with G.S. 50C-10 and G.S. 5A-25's default civil contempt rule. Tyll v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite>            96, 758 S.E.2d 411 (2014).

            Authority of Trial Court. - Trial court exceeded its authority because it had no authority to order defendant not to possess or purchase any firearms, to surrender his firearms, or to revoke his concealed carry permit; neither the complaint nor the ex
            parte no-contact order mentioned firearms, so defendant had no notice of the possibility of an order requiring surrender, and since the trial court imposed the provision after the hearing, sua sponte, neither party had an opportunity to address
            it at the hearing or to object. Russell v. Wofford, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 816 S.E.2d 909 (2018).
