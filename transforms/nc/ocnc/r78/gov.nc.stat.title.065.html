                <p>
                    Notwithstanding any conflicting provision of law or of the charter or bylaws of any corporation affected by this section, in the case of any nonprofit cemetery corporation chartered prior to the year 1900 whose charter has expired prior to May 18, 1955,
                    a quorum at any meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, or of amending the charter of such corporation, or both, shall consist of the holders of ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding shares of the
                    capital stock of such corporation having voting powers, present in person or represented by proxy; and a meeting of the stockholders of such corporation for such purpose or purposes may be called by any two stockholders after 10 days'
                    notice by registered mail to all stockholders of record at their last known addresses as shown by the stock book of such corporation. The concurrence of a majority of the shares represented at such meeting shall be sufficient to authorize
                    an amendment or amendments to the charter of such corporation in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 55-31.

                    A person who proposes to acquire control of an existing cemetery company, whether by purchasing the capital stock of the company, purchasing an owner's interest in the company, or otherwise acting to effectively change the control of the company, shall
                    first make application on a form supplied by the Commission for a certificate of approval of the proposed change of control. The application shall contain the name and address of each proposed new owner. The Commission shall issue
                    a certificate of approval only after it determines that the proposed new owners are qualified by character, experience, and financial responsibility to control and operate the cemetery company in a legal and proper manner, and that
                    the interest of the public generally will not be jeopardized by the proposed change in control. An application for approval of a change of control must be completed and accompanied by a filing fee to be set by the Commission in an
                    amount not to exceed one thousand six hundred dollars ($1,600). The Commission shall not approve any change of control until the applicant has provided sufficient evidence that any trust account required under

                        Abandonment. - In a declaratory judgment action that stemmed from a long-standing dispute concerning a family cemetery located on defendants' property, the appellate court concluded that plaintiffs were persons with legal right to the real property, notwithstanding
                        the fact that they did not hold a fee or leasehold interest in the real property and that plaintiffs had not "abandoned" the cemetery. The record contained evidence that plaintiffs had consistently maintained or attempted to maintain
                        the cemetery throughout the long history of this litigation and that plaintiffs intended to continue to maintain it in the future. King v. Pender County, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 90, 790

                        This section is much broader than the older C.S. 5030, and reflects a recognition of the need for broad authority by church authority to meet the needs of a growing membership in relocating graves which would restrict that growth. Singletary v. McCormick,

                        Relocation of Street to Enlarge Church Facility. - Though graves proposed to be relocated were within the area of a relocated street, the street was to be relocated "as the means to" expand or enlarge an existing church facility, and therefore relocation
                        of the graves was permissible. Singletary v. McCormick, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 597, 244 S.E.2d 731 (1978).

                        Section Not Exclusive Grounds for Disinterment. - This statute does not provide the exclusive grounds for the disinterment of a body. The statute speaks to the situation where a body had been properly interred, but for some reason justified by the public
                        interest or by some compelling private interests it is necessary to effect a disinterment, removal, and reinterment. This statute nowhere provides for the situation where there has been an improper interment. Strickland v. Tant,

                        Abandonment. - In a declaratory judgment action that stemmed from a long-standing dispute concerning a family cemetery located on defendants' property, the appellate court concluded that plaintiffs were persons with legal right to the real property, notwithstanding
                        the fact that they did not hold a fee or leasehold interest in the real property and that plaintiffs had not "abandoned" the cemetery. The record contained evidence that plaintiffs had consistently maintained or attempted to maintain
                        the cemetery throughout the long history of this litigation and that plaintiffs intended to continue to maintain it in the future. King v. Pender County, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 90, 790
