                The purpose of this Chapter is to protect the safety and welfare of students, faculty, and staff in institutions of higher education by fostering integrity, proficiency, and competence among campus police agencies and campus police officers. To achieve
                this purpose, the General Assembly finds that a Campus Police Program needs to be established. As part of the Campus Police Program, the Attorney General is given the authority to certify a private, nonprofit institution of higher education,
                other than those described by G.S. 116-15(d), as a campus police agency and to commission an individual as a campus police officer.

        <p>
            Statute Did Not Violate Establishment Clause. - Campus Police Act, G.S. 74G-1 to G.S. 74G-13, providing for secular and neutral police protection for the benefit of the students, faculty, and staff of a liberal arts college affiliated with the Presbyterian
            Church, as applied to defendant's conviction for driving while impaired, did not offend the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. State v. Yencer, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 292</cite>, 718 S.E.2d 615 (2011).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Stop and Seizure. - Denial of defendant's motion to suppress a college campus police officer's stop and seizure of defendant was improper, as the college was a religious institution and delegation of police power to the college under G.S. 74G-2 was a
            violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. State v. Yencer, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 696 S.E.2d 875 (2010).
        </p>
        <p>
            Because campus police officers, like municipal police officers, act pursuant to authority granted by the General Assembly under the Campus Police Act, and their duties involve the exercise of some portion of the sovereign power, the campus police officers
            were entitled to public official immunity for their acts in furtherance of their official duties so long as those acts were not corrupt, malicious, or outside of and beyond the scope of their duties. Mills v. Duke Univ.,
            <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 759 S.E.2d 341 (2014).

                An applicant for certification as a campus police agency must file with the Attorney General either a copy of a liability insurance policy that meets the requirements of this section or a certificate of self-insurance designating assets sufficient to
                satisfy the coverage requirements of this section if the applicant is a nonpublic entity. The policy or certificate of self-insurance must provide not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) of coverage per incident for personal injury
                or property damage resulting from a negligent act of the applicant or an agent or employee of the applicant operating in the course and scope of employment or under color of law. The form, execution, and terms of a liability insurance
                policy must meet the requirements of the Attorney General.

                An insurance carrier that issues a liability insurance policy required by this section may cancel the policy upon giving 30 days' written notice to both the campus police agency and the Attorney General. The written notice must be given by certified mail,
                return receipt requested. Cancellation of a liability insurance policy does not affect any liability on the policy that accrued prior to the effective cancellation date.

            <li id="t74Gs74G-3ol1c">
                A campus police agency that is a nonpublic entity must maintain the liability insurance policy or certificate of self-insurance required by this section in effect at all times. The Attorney General shall suspend the certification of a campus police agency
                that fails to maintain a liability insurance policy or certificate of self-insurance when required to do so by this section. A certification suspended for this reason may not be reinstated until the person whose certification was suspended
                files with the Attorney General an application for reinstatement and either the required liability insurance policy or certificate of self-insurance.

            were entitled to public official immunity for their acts in furtherance of their official duties so long as those acts were not corrupt, malicious, or outside of and beyond the scope of their duties. Mills v. Duke Univ.,

        <p>
            University Campus Police Departments. - Dismissal of the suit under the North Carolina Public Records Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 132, was proper, because the university campus police department was not subject to the Act, when campus police departments
            were not enumerated in the list of departments and agencies qualifying as a public law enforcement agency, and G.S. 74G-5(a) did not specifically charge the Attorney General with the custodianship of arrest or incident reports of campus police
            departments. Ochsner v. Elon Univ., <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 167, 725 S.E.2d 914 (2012).
