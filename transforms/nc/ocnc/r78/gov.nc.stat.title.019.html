        The North Carolina obscenity nuisance statute is directed to pictorial obscenity.
       </b> It does not apply to written material, and it regulates commercial trafficking in obscene pictorial material only if the exhibition of obscene films is "a predominant and regular course of business" and if other obscene
                        pictorial materials are "a principal or substantial part of the stock in trade." By such means, the legislature has confined its nuisance abatement authorization to theaters regularly showing pornographic films to adult audiences
                        and to "adult bookstores" with coin-operated film projectors explicitly showing sexual activity or photographs or pictorial magazines showing similar activity, or two or three of them. Fehlhaber v. North Carolina, 675 F.2d 1365

                        Nuisance Need Not Be Nucleus of Crime. - It is not essential to the nuisance defined by this section that the acts of the customers which impart that quality to the premises and the business conducted there should be violations of the criminal law, either
                        generally speaking or under the terms of the statute, nor is it necessary that the nuisance declared should have a nucleus of crime essential to its existence. While nuisance is frequently associated with criminal offenses, the
                        law is not under the necessity of predicating one crime upon another to make valid its denunciation of an act which it denominates a nuisance. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 301</cite>, 20

                        Establishing a Nuisance. - Based upon reading G.S. 19-1(a) and G.S. 19-1.2(6) together, in order to establish a nuisance, a plaintiff must show that a defendant has leased or used the defendant's property for the purpose of the illegal possession and
                        sale of drugs, and as a means of showing the defendant's purpose in leasing or operating the building, the plaintiff may present evidence that the sale of controlled substances has occurred regularly; the defendant will then be
                        permitted to offer evidence of a lawful business purpose in order to negate the inference that drug transactions are the sole purpose of the leasing or use of the property. State ex rel. City of Salisbury v. Campbell,

                        No Breach of Peace. - In city's nuisance action seeking to establish that 24 police trips to the landlords' property over the course of several years constituted a breach of the peace pursuant G.S. 19-1(b) and G.S. 19-1.1(1), seven of those police visits
                        related to domestic incidents and one visit involving a search warrant did not constitute breaches of the peace, because there was no evidence that these events involved any threats to other citizens or disturbed the public order.

                        Not every isolated obscene publication is a nuisance that can be abated under G.S. 19-5. First it must be found that the book or magazine is one of many, such that all together they make up a large part of the bookstore's inventory. Once this initial
                        determination is made, however, each individual obscene publication is a nuisance, and any and every one of them can be abated. State ex rel. Andrews v. Chateau X, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 251</cite>,

                        Establishing a Nuisance. - Based upon reading G.S. 19-1(a) and G.S. 19-1.2(6) together, in order to establish a nuisance, a plaintiff must show that a defendant has leased or used the defendant's property for the purpose of the illegal possession and
                        sale of drugs, and as a means of showing the defendant's purpose in leasing or operating the building, the plaintiff may present evidence that the sale of controlled substances has occurred regularly; the defendant will then be
                        permitted to offer evidence of a lawful business purpose in order to negate the inference that drug transactions are the sole purpose of the leasing or use of the property. State ex rel. City of Salisbury v. Campbell,

                    From and after service of a copy of the notice of hearing of the application for a preliminary injunction, provided for in G.S. 19-2.4 upon the place, or its manager, or acting manager, or person then in charge, all such parties are deemed to have knowledge
                    of the contents of the restraining order and the use of the place occurring thereafter. Where the circumstantial proof warrants a determination that a person had knowledge of the nuisance prior to such service of process, the court
                    may make such finding.

                    Wherever a nuisance is kept, maintained, or exists, as defined in this Article, the Attorney General, district attorney, county, municipality, or any private citizen of the county may maintain a civil action in the name of the State of North Carolina
                    to abate a nuisance under this Chapter, perpetually to enjoin all persons from maintaining the same, and to enjoin the use of any structure or thing adjudged to be a nuisance under this Chapter; provided, however, that no private citizen
                    may maintain such action where the alleged nuisance involves the illegal possession or sale of obscene or lewd matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon request from the Attorney General, district attorney, county or municipality, including the sheriff or chief of police of any county or municipality, the Alcohol Law Enforcement Division of the Department of Public Safety or any other law enforcement
                    agency with jurisdiction may investigate alleged public nuisances and make recommendations regarding actions to abate the public nuisances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an action is instituted by a private person, the complainant shall execute a bond prior to the issuance of a restraining order or a temporary injunction, with good and sufficient surety to be approved by the court or clerk thereof, in the sum of not
                    less than one thousand dollars ($1,000), to secure to the party enjoined the damages he may sustain if such action is wrongfully brought, not prosecuted to final judgment, or is dismissed, or is not maintained, or if it is finally
                    decided that the temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction ought not to have been granted. The party enjoined shall have recourse against said bond for all damages suffered, including damages to his property, person, or
                    character and including reasonable attorney's fees incurred by him in making defense to said action. No bond shall be required of the prosecuting attorney, the Attorney General, county, or municipality, and no action shall be maintained
                    against any public official or public entity, their employees, or agents for investigating or maintaining an action for abatement of a nuisance under the provisions of this Chapter.

                        An action to abate a public nuisance by injunction or otherwise must be maintained in the name of the State, and this section designates with particularity those who may become relators and prosecute the cause in the name of the State. Dare County v.

                        County Commissioners May Not Prosecute Action in Name of County. - While the members of a county board of commissioners may, as individuals, become relators under this section, they may not prosecute this action in the name of the county. Dare County
                        v. Mater, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 179</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 244 (1952).

                        Procedure Cannot Be Invoked against Alcoholic Control Board. - It was never intended that the procedure here invoked to abate a nuisance should be applied against the alcoholic control board set up under color of legislative authority, or against one
                        who rents a building to such a board for the purpose of operating a liquor control store. State ex rel. Amick v. Lancaster, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 157</cite>, 44 S.E.2d 733 (1947).

                        Proceeding Must Be Based on Specific Act Denounced by G.S. 19-1. - The proceeding by a citizen in the name of the State for injunction, the closing of a place of business and the seizure and sale of the personal property used therewith, must be based
                        upon allegation and proof of one or more of the specific acts denounced by G.S. 19-1. State ex rel. Dickey v. Alverson, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 29</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 135 (1945).

                        Allegation of Direct Injury to Citizen Bringing Action Not Required. - While ordinarily a resident and citizen may not enjoin public officials from putting into effect the provisions of a legislative enactment on the ground that the act is unconstitutional
                        unless he alleges and proves that he will suffer direct injury, such allegation is not necessary in an action in the name of the State under this section to enjoin the maintenance of a gambling nuisance. State ex rel. Summrell

                        Bond Requirement for Private Complainants is Constitutional. - The provision of this statute requiring a private citizen to post a bond, while the district attorney is not required to do so, is a valid distinction and does not thereby constitute arbitrary
                        and capricious State action. State ex rel. Gilchrist v. Hurley, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 433, 269 S.E.2d 646 (1980), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 720</cite>, 274 S.E.2d 233

                        Evidence Supporting Abatement. - The evidence disclosed that defendant operated a tourist camp with filling station, dining room and dance hall in front, and cabins in the rear, that the camp was on highway in a thickly settled rural community, that whiskey
                        and contraceptives were sold, that drunken men and women were seen nightly at the place, and seen to go in the cabins in pairs and stay for a short time, that the community was constantly awakened at night by loud and boisterous
                        conduct and profanity, that fighting occurred between drunken men and women, with many of both sexes nude or indecently clad, and that the general reputation of the place was bad, is held amply sufficient to be submitted to the
                        jury upon the issue of whether the place constituted a nuisance against public morals as defined by G.S. 19-1, and to support a judgment for its abatement in accordance with this section in an action brought by the solicitor (now
                        district attorney) as relator. Carpenter v. Boyles, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 432</cite>, 196 S.E. 850 (1938).

                        Lease Is Made in Contemplation of Statute. - A lease contract will be held to have been made in contemplation of the statute in effect at the time of the execution of the lease, providing for the abatement of nuisance against public morals, and the lessor
                        is subject to the rights of the State to padlock the premises in accordance with the statute if they are used in operating a nuisance as defined by the act. Barker v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 519</cite>,

                        from employing private counsel to assist in public nuisance actions. Whitfield v. Gilchrist, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 485 S.E.2d 61 (1997), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 39</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Compensation for Attorney. - Section 19-8 is the proper source of compensation for an attorney representing a prevailing party in a public nuisance action, at least when the State has not expressly entered into a valid contract for such legal services.
                        Whitfield v. Gilchrist, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 39</cite>, 497 S.E.2d 412 (1998).

                    <p>
                        The enactment of G.S. 19-8 indicates that the legislature contemplated only one noncontractural method of payment for attorneys who undertake to maintain, on behalf of anyone, a civil action to abate a nuisance as authorized by this section. Whitfield

                    Where such application for a preliminary injunction is made, the court may, on application of the complainant showing good cause, issue an ex parte temporary restraining order in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                    Rule 65(b), preserving the status quo and restraining the defendant and all other persons from removing or in any manner interfering with any evidence specifically described, or in any manner removing or interfering with the personal
                    property and contents of the place where such nuisance is alleged to exist, until the decision of the court granting or refusing such preliminary injunction and until further order of the court thereon. Nothing herein shall be interpreted
                    to allow the prior restraint of the distribution of any matter or the sale of the stock in trade, but an inventory and full accounting of all business transactions involving alleged obscene or lewd matter thereafter shall be required.
                    The inventory provisions provided by this section shall not apply to nuisances occurring at a private dwelling place unless the court finds the private dwelling place is used for profit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any person, firm, or corporation enjoined pursuant to this section may file with the court a motion to dissolve any temporary restraining order. Such a motion shall be heard within 24 hours of the time a copy of the motion is served on the complaining
                    party, or on the next day the superior courts are open in the district, whichever is later. At such hearing the complaining party shall have the burden of showing why the restraining order should be continued.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event a temporary restraining order is issued, it may be served in accordance with the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 4, or may be served
                    by handing to and leaving a copy of such order with any person in charge of such place or residing therein, or by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place at or upon one or more of the principal doors or entrances to such place,
                    or by such service under said Rule 4, delivery and posting. The officer serving such temporary restraining order shall forthwith enter upon the property and make and return into court an inventory of the personal property and contents
                    situated in and used in conducting or maintaining such nuisance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any violation of such temporary restraining order is a contempt of court, and where such order is posted, mutilation or removal thereof, while the same remains in force, is a contempt of court, provided such posted order contains therein a notice to that
                    effect.

        Temporary Restraining Order Does Not Operate as Prior Restraint.
       </b> - The temporary restraining order authorized to be issued following the filing of the complaint and application for a preliminary injunction does not operate as a prior restraint on the distribution of particular publications
                        and motion pictures presumptively protected by U.S. Const., Amend. I until an adversary hearing determines otherwise. Fehlhaber v. North Carolina, 445 F. Supp. 130 (E.D.N.C. 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 675 F.2d 1365 (4th Cir.

        Construction of Inventory and Full Accounting Provisions of Section.
       </b> - Reading this section as a whole, the apparent purpose of the inventory and accounting provision is to provide the factual basis for the determination of whether the business deals in obscene items as a "substantial"
                        portion of its stock in trade, in the case of bookstores, or "in the regular course of business," in the case of theaters. Such purpose could be accomplished by a full accounting that included no more than the date, item purchased,
                        and amount paid. Because a statute may be declared unconstitutional on its face only if it offers no plausible constitutional interpretation, the court adopts this construction of the full accounting provision and not a construction
                        which would require the recording of individual customers who purchase books or attend movies. Fehlhaber v. North Carolina, 445 F. Supp. 130 (E.D.N.C. 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 675 F.2d 1365 (4th Cir. 1982).

        The requirement of an inventory by an officer does not require a warrantless search in contravention of U.S. Const., Amend. IV,

                        Order Does Not Take Private Property Without Due Process or Equal Protection. - The fact that the district attorney, upon filing a nuisance complaint, can obtain a temporary restraining order pursuant to this section without posting bond and without notice
                        to the persons restrained does not constitute the taking of private property without due process or equal protection since the statute does not authorize the seizure or destruction of property but merely preserves the status quo
                        until a hearing can be held; the statute establishes a procedure for the owner of the property in question immediately to challenge the validity of the temporary restraining order and places the burden of its continuance on the
                        district attorney; and the procedure mandated by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 65(b) applies to the issuance of the temporary

        A defendant under an injunction need have no fear if he opens a traditional magazine stand

                <p>
                    Lewd matter is contraband, and there are no property rights therein. All personal property, including all money and other considerations, declared to be a nuisance under the provisions of G.S. 19-1.3 and other sections of this Article, are subject to
                    forfeiture to the local government and are recoverable as damages in the county wherein such matter is sold, exhibited or otherwise used. Such property including moneys may be traced to and shall be recoverable from persons who, under
                    G.S. 19-2.4, have knowledge of the nuisance at the time such moneys are received by them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon judgment against the defendant or defendants in legal proceedings brought pursuant to this Article, an accounting shall be made by such defendant or defendants of all moneys received by them which have been declared to be a nuisance under this Article.
                    An amount equal to the sum of all moneys estimated to have been taken in as gross income from such unlawful commercial activity shall be forfeited to the general funds of the city and county governments wherein such activity took place,
                    to be shared equally, as a forfeiture of the fruits of an unlawful enterprise, and as partial restitution for damages done to the public welfare; provided, however, that no provision of this Article shall authorize the recovery of
                    any moneys or gross income received from the sale of any book, magazine, or exhibition of any motion picture prior to the issuance of a preliminary injunction. Where the action is brought pursuant to this Article, special injury need
                    not be proven, and the costs of abatement are a lien on both the real and personal property used in maintaining the nuisance. Costs of abatement include, but are not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon the filing of the action, the plaintiff may file a notice of lis pendens in the official records of the county where the property is located.

                <p>
                    If it is judicially found after an adversary hearing pursuant to this Article that a tenant or occupant of a building or tenement, under a lawful title, uses such place for the purposes of lewdness, assignation, prostitution, gambling, sale or possession
                    of illegal alcoholic beverages or substances proscribed under the North Carolina Controlled Substances Act, or repeated acts which create and constitute a breach of the peace, such use makes void the lease or other title under which
                    he holds, at the option of the owner, and, without any act of the owner, causes the right of possession to revert and vest in such owner.

                    The clear proceeds of civil penalties and forfeitures provided for in this section, except for penalties and properties that accrue to local governments instead of the State, shall be remitted to the Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund in accordance with

                </h3>
                <p>
                    In all actions where a preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, or an order of abatement is issued pursuant to this Article in which the nuisance consists of or includes at least two prior occurrences within five years of the manufacture, possession
                    with intent to sell, or sale of controlled substances as defined by the North Carolina Controlled Substances Act, two prior occurrences of the possession of any controlled substance included within Schedule I or II of that Act, or
                    two prior convictions within five years of violation of G.S. 14-72.7, the real property on which the nuisance exists or is maintained is subject to forfeiture in accordance with this section. In the case of the two prior convictions
                    of G.S. 14-72.7, the convictions shall not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If all of the owners of the property are defendants in the action, the plaintiff, other than a plaintiff who is a private citizen, may request forfeiture of the real property as part of the relief sought. If forfeiture is requested, and if jurisdiction
                    over all defendant owners is established, upon judgment against the defendant or defendants, the court shall order forfeiture as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li id="t19a01s19-6.1ol11">
                        If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that all the owners either (i) have participated in maintaining the nuisance on the property, or (ii) prior to the action had written notice from the plaintiff, or any governmental agent or entity authorized
                        to bring an action pursuant to this Chapter, that the nuisance existed or was maintained on the property and have not made good faith efforts to stop the nuisance from occurring or recurring, the court shall order that the property
                        be forfeited;
                    </li>
                    <li id="t19a01s19-6.1ol12">
                        If the court finds that one or more of the owners did not participate in maintaining the nuisance on the property or did not have written notice from the plaintiff prior to the action that the nuisance existed or was maintained on the property, the court
                        shall not order forfeiture of the property immediately upon judgment. However, if after judgment and an order directing the defendants to abate the nuisance, the nuisance either continues, begins again, or otherwise recurs within
                        five years of the order and the defendants have not made good faith efforts to abate the nuisance, the plaintiff may petition the court for forfeiture. Upon such petition, the defendant owner or owners shall be given notice and
                        an opportunity to appear and be heard at a hearing to determine the continuation or recurrence of the nuisance. If, in this hearing (i) the plaintiff establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the nuisance, with the owner's
                        or owners' knowledge, has either continued, begun again, or otherwise recurred, and (ii) the defendants fail to establish that they have made and are continuing to make good faith efforts to abate the nuisance, the court shall
                        order that the property be forfeited.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    For the purposes of this section, factors which may evidence good faith by the defendant to abate the nuisance include but are not limited to (i) cooperation with law enforcement authorities to abate the nuisance; (ii) lease restrictions prohibiting the
                    illegal possession or sale of narcotic drugs and an action to evict a tenant for any violations of the lease provision; (iii) a criminal record check of prospective tenants; and (iv) reference checks of prior residency of prospective
                    tenants.

                <p>
                    Upon an order of forfeiture, title to the property shall vest in the school board of the county in which the property is located. If at the time of forfeiture the property is subject to a lien or security interest of a person not participating in the
                    maintenance of the nuisance, the school board shall either (i) pay an amount to that person satisfying the lien or security interest; or (ii) sell the property and satisfy the lien or security interest from the proceeds of the sale.
                    If the property is not subject to any lien or security interest at the time of forfeiture, the school board may hold, maintain, lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of the property as it sees fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon the filing of the action, the plaintiff may file a notice of lis pendens in the official records of the county where the property is located. If the plaintiff files a notice of lis pendens, any person purchasing or obtaining an interest in the property
                    thereafter shall be considered to have notice of the alleged nuisance, and shall forfeit his interest in the property upon a judgment of forfeiture in favor of the plaintiff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If in the same action in which real property is forfeited the court finds that a tenant or occupant of the property participated in or maintained the nuisance, the lease or other title under which the tenant or occupant holds is void, and the right of
                    possession vests in the new owner. Upon forfeiture, the rights of innocent tenants occupying separate units of the property who were not involved in the nuisance at the time the action was filed shall be in accordance with any relevant
                    lease provisions in effect at the time or, in the absence of relevant lease provisions, in accordance with the law applying to other tenants or occupants of property that is sold, foreclosed upon, or otherwise obtained by new owners.
