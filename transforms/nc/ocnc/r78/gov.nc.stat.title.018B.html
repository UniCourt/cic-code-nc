       § 18B-100. Purpose of Chapter.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      This Chapter is intended to establish a uniform system of control over the sale, purchase, transportation, manufacture, consumption, and possession of alcoholic beverages in North Carolina, and to provide procedures to insure the proper administration of the ABC laws under a uniform system throughout the State. This Chapter shall be liberally construed to the end that the sale, purchase, transportation, manufacture, consumption, and possession of alcoholic beverages shall be prohibited except as authorized in this Chapter. If any provision of this Chapter, or its application to any person or circumstance, is determined by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such provision shall be stricken and the remaining provisions shall be construed in accordance with the intent of the General Assembly to further limit rather than expand commerce in alcoholic beverages, and with respect to malt beverages, unfortified wine, and fortified wine, the remaining provisions shall be construed to enhance strict regulatory control over taxation, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages through the three-tier regulatory system and the franchise laws imposed by this Chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as provided in this Chapter, local ordinances establishing different rules on the manufacture, sale, purchase, transportation, possession, consumption, or other use of alcoholic beverages, or requiring additional permits or fees, are prohibited.

      Sessions Laws 2018-100, s. 8(a), is a severability clause.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2019-18 provides in its preamble: "Whereas, the General Assembly reaffirms its support of the Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system for the distribution of malt beverages and finds that the Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system does all of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Promotes consumer choice and product variety by providing a platform that enables new malt beverage products to come to market that might not otherwise be available to the consumer. These laws encourage wholesalers to make investments in their businesses necessary to expand distribution of new products and to allow large and small breweries alike an opportunity to enter the market through independent distribution. Wholesaler investments include adding resources such as warehouses, personnel, vehicles, equipment, merchandise, and marketing. Consumers have access to an exceedingly wide array of malt beverage products, unlike other industries that foster closed distribution networks and vertical integration.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Promotes the growth of the craft beer industry by providing suppliers with access to markets outside of the brewery. Brewers that use wholesalers are able to instantly access and utilize a wholesaler's established infrastructure in markets they may not otherwise be able to enter. Smaller breweries further benefit because wholesalers are able to act independently to carry all brands, from large and small suppliers. The goal of these laws is to allow brewers of all sizes to fairly compete in the marketplace and to access retailers of all sizes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Helps ensure that the industry, as a whole, complies with the alcohol laws of this State. A wholesaler must remain independent and free from unfair conduct to promote responsible sales and marketing practices. Wholesaler independence also promotes and maintains fair dealing among industry participants. Ultimately, these measures protect consumers and the public from abuses that might occur absent the three-tier system.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Promotes a vibrant marketplace that carefully balances fair competition with health and public safety concerns. The Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system ensure that all three tiers operate independently and on a level playing field so that no one participant or sector of the industry becomes too dominant over the others. These laws allow for fair checks and balances in the beer industry. Wholesaler independence further creates a transparent and accountable distribution system that assists in identifying improper marketing practices and potentially unsafe products when issues arise and provides brewers that engage a wholesaler with an established means to access new markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Prevents vertical integration of the manufacturing, distribution, and retail tiers. This still occurs in other countries today where adverse health and public safety effects are observed. The historical three-tier system model incorporated a deliberate regulatory structure that prevents monopolization. However, as the number of beer industry participants has grown substantially, it is necessary to make important adjustments to the three-tier system to promote the overall success of the beer manufacturing industry in North Carolina by recognizing the different stages of brewery development.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) Assists in collecting excise taxes, particularly from nonresident suppliers. While self-distributing resident breweries are required to remit excise taxes directly to the Department of Revenue, wholesalers collect and remit the excise tax on malt beverages on behalf of resident and nonresident suppliers to the Department of Revenue, totaling approximately $140 million in excise taxes each year to the State.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(7) Promotes local regulatory control, temperance, and moderate consumption of malt beverages. The three-tier system in particular incorporates features to promote healthy competition in the marketplace while minimizing overly-aggressive marketing practices, such as limits on quantity discounts, requirements of nondiscriminatory treatment among wholesalers and retailers, and limits on advertising and promotional materials. The three-tier system also provides clear chain of custody for products in distribution, which enables law enforcement to easily track products in the marketplace when issues arise.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(8) Provides a vital platform that promotes product safety for consumers. Malt beverage distributors invest heavily in infrastructure, such as modern warehouses and vehicles, that maintain product integrity during distribution. There are also strict record-keeping requirements, which enable wholesalers to readily track malt beverage products sold in the market for prompt return in the event of a product recall.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(9)
   Encourages wholesalers, under the Beer Franchise Law, to invest capital and labor for suppliers of all sizes, large and small, to expand into new markets with new products. Unfair or arbitrary termination is prohibited, but suppliers who are subject to the Beer Franchise Law are still afforded the ability to terminate a distribution agreement for good cause. The Beer Franchise Law inhibits forced consolidation among wholesalers. The three-tier system also affords small retailers the same market access opportunities to the same wide selection of brands that other large-scale retailers have, and on equal terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly also reaffirms its support of the craft beer industry and makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The current small-brewery provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite> of the General Statutes were intended to foster the growth of small craft breweries while simultaneously protecting wholesalers from the risk of economic uncertainty. Since the adoption of those provisions, however, the craft beer industry has seen exponential growth. The craft beer industry now provides a significant source of high-quality manufacturing and service employment and wages and generates significant tax revenue for the State. In addition, the growth of the craft beer industry has resulted in significant positive secondary impacts on the economy through increased business to a myriad of suppliers to the craft breweries, resulting in even greater employment and tax revenue for the State's citizens.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) It is in the best interest of the State to continue supporting the entrepreneurial spirit and economic growth driven by the craft beer industry. Yet it remains vital to preserve the integrity of the State's three-tier system. Today, mid-sized independent breweries possess only a fraction of the malt beverage market in light of increased consolidation and globalization of large suppliers. Consequently, the growth of these mid-sized independent breweries promotes economic development, employment and wages, and significant tax revenue without the same risks of harm that the three-tier system is designed to minimize.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) In view of these new market realities, the existing small brewery provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite> of the General Statutes warrant revision. Specifically, recognition for a new category of breweries, Mid-Sized Independent Breweries, is needed to reflect the market's evolution, foster the continued growth of the craft beer industry, promote consumer choice, ensure access to market, and promote stable and healthy competition in the malt beverage industry in this State. The following legislative enactments are expressly intended to further these purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that regulation of the malt beverage industry and the objectives sought to be achieved by this act fall squarely within the authority granted to the State by the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution and the inherent police powers of this State; Now, therefore,"

       ABC Permit Preempts Municipal Zoning Ordinance.
   
   - In case in which petitioner, without objection by respondent board, argued that the decision of the ABC Commission to grant him a permit preempted respondent's denial of his special exception use permit request since the zoning ordinance, upon which respondent's denial was based, attempted to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages, which is a violation of State law, the trial court did not err in concluding that petitioner, as the holder of a valid ABC permit issued by the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, was entitled to be issued a city beer license, and in ordering the tax collector of the city to issue any city license.

      <p>
       Alcoholic Content.
   
   - The State's evidence was sufficient for the jury in a prosecution of defendant for illegal possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale in violation of former G.S. 18A-7 where it tended to show that defendant had in his constructive possession more than four liters of liquor with an alcoholic content of greater than 21%. State v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 274 S.E.2d 353 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The General Assembly clearly intended to preempt the regulation of malt beverages
   
   in order to prevent local governments from enacting regulatory ordinances. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 550</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 756 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing local governments to regulate malt beverages contrary to State law would result in an intolerable situation whereby citizens lawfully possessing beer in one county would be violating a criminal law in another. The legislature preempted the field in order to avoid such confusion. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 550</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 756 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Malt Beverage Evidence Lacking.
   
   - State did not provide substantial evidence to show defendant's actual or constructive possession of a malt beverage to prove that defendant had been a person less than 21-years-old in possession of a malt beverage in violation of G.S. 18B-302(b)(1). In particular, the State did not have anyone testify that the alcohol that defendant consumed or which had been in the vehicle that defendant had been driving was a malt beverage, as defined by G.S. 18B-101(9) according to the percentage of alcohol present in a drink. State v. Hensley, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 661 S.E.2d 18 (2008).

       A permit grants a privilege.
   
   It does not convey either a constitutional right or a property right. Hursey v. Town of Gibsonville, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 522</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 161 (1974).

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Constitutionality.
       </b>
       - Provisions of North Carolina's alcoholic beverage code, which prohibited out-of-state wineries from selling wine directly to North Carolina residents but allowed North Carolina wineries to make direct sales, violated the Commerce Clause, and State officials were enjoined from enforcing those provisions. Beskind v. Easley, 197 F. Supp. 2d 464 (W.D.N.C. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       State's Regulations in Relation to Interstate Commerce Clause.
   
   - Both by the U.S. Const., Amend. XXI and this Chapter, liquor has been placed in a category somewhat different from other articles of commerce, and the State's regulations thereof should not be held obnoxious to the interstate commerce clause, unless clearly in conflict with granted federal powers and congressional action thereunder. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 314</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 158 (1944).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Classification of Offense.
   
   - Trial court did not err in assigning one point in defendant's prior record level calculation under G.S. 15A-1340.14(b)(5) for conviction of purchase or possession of beer or wine under G.S. 18B-302, as any person who violated any provision of the chapter at issue was guilty of a class one misdemeanor. State v. Frady, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 623 S.E.2d 346 (2006).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Guilty Knowledge.
   
   - This section must be interpreted in the light of the common-law principle that guilty knowledge is an essential element of crime, and therefore a person cannot be held guilty of illegally transporting alcoholic beverages if he has no knowledge of the nature of the goods transported. State v. Welch, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 77</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 199 (1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       A principal acts through its agents and employees and is responsible for their conduct. American Legion v. North Carolina State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 266, 218 S.E.2d 513 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession may be either actual or constructive.
   
   State v. Meyers, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 239</cite>, 129 S.E. 600 (1925). See also State v. Norris, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 191</cite>, 173 S.E. 14 (1934); State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 382</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 268 (1951); State v. Harrelson, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 604</cite>, 96 S.E.2d 867 (1957); State v. Glenn, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 156</cite>, 110 S.E.2d 791 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prima facie case of the unlawful sale of alcoholic beverages may be established by circumstances sufficient to show that the defendant had in his constructive possession large quantities of whiskey not on his premises, in the possession of others who held it for him. State v. Pierce, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 766</cite>, 136 S.E. 121 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       An accused has possession of alcoholic beverages when he has both the power and the intent to control its disposition or use. The requisite power to control may reside in the accused acting alone or in combination with others. State v. Fuqua, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 168</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 667 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a man procures another to obtain liquor for him and put it in a given place, and the other performs this agreement and places the liquor, then the possession is complete. A person may be in the possession of the article which he has not at the moment about his person. The constructive possession, as well as the actual possession, is in the contemplation of the statute. State v. Myers, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 239</cite>, 129 S.E. 600 (1925); State v. Pierce, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 766</cite>, 136 S.E. 121 (1926).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Held Sufficient.
   
   - Although defendant made no mention of the sale of alcohol, and there was no mention of a price to be paid or received for the liquor, the evidence was sufficient to show a sale under this section where defendant left the house with a request from the undercover officer that defendant provide her with liquor, complied with the request, and received money for the transfer of alcohol and marijuana. State v. Fletcher, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 373 S.E.2d 681 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden of Showing Right to Possess.
   
   - This section contemplates that no person shall transport or have in his possession for the purpose of sale any alcoholic beverages. There are exceptions and, ordinarily, the burden is on him who asserts that he comes within the exception to show by way of defense that he is one of that class authorized by law to have intoxicants in his possession. State v. Gordon, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 304</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 43 (1944); State v. Fletcher, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 373 S.E.2d 681 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession of Taxpaid Liquor at Unauthorized Place Unlawful.
   
   - Possession of taxpaid whiskey is illegal under this section if it is not at an authorized place. State v. Welborn, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 268</cite>, 106 S.E.2d 204 (1958).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The possession of nontaxpaid liquor
   
   in any quantity anywhere in the State is, without exception, unlawful. State v. Barnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 223</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 904 (1949).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of Possession Immaterial.
   
   - Upon the trial for transporting alcoholic beverages in violation of this Article, the purpose of the possession of the intoxicants, or that it was for the purpose of profit, is immaterial, and the fact that the person accused is carrying intoxicants from one place to another is sufficient. State v. Sigmon, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 684</cite>, 130 S.E. 854 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether the transportation of nontaxpaid whiskey is unlawful does not depend upon whether it is being transported for the purpose of sale. State v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 173</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 299 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "transport" means to carry or convey
   
   from one place to another, and therefore a person transports alcoholic beverages if he carries them on his person or conveys them in a vehicle under his control or in any other manner, regardless of whether they belong to him or are in his custody. State v. Welch, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 77</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 199 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A person is guilty of unlawfully transporting alcoholic beverages
   
   in violation of this section if he knowingly transports alcoholic beverages for any purpose other than those specified in this Chapter. State v. Welch, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 77</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 199 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Transportation as Including Possession.
   
   - Where the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of transporting whiskey under this section, the transportation of spiritous liquor included the possession. State v. Sigmon, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 684</cite>, 130 S.E. 854 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an indictment for violating the prohibition law contained a count as to the unlawful possession and also as to unlawfully transporting spirituous liquor, an acquittal upon the first was not inconsistent with a conviction on the second issue. They are two distinct offenses under the statute. State v. Sigmon, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 684</cite>, 130 S.E. 854 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only a person in the actual or constructive possession of nontaxpaid whiskey, absent conspiracy or aiding and abetting, could be guilty of the unlawful transportation thereof. State v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 173</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 299 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Receiving Alcoholic Beverages.
   
   - There is no provision in this Article which in express terms prohibits one from receiving alcoholic beverages. Except as embraced and included by the acts which are prohibited in the statute, the mere receiving of alcoholic beverages is not forbidden. State v. Hammond, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 602</cite>, 125 S.E. 402 (1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was bad pleading to make the mere receipt of liquor the subject of a separate and independent count; and the charge that the mere receipt of same, though only in the home of the recipient and kept there only for a lawful purpose, is forbidden was not warranted by any proper construction of the statute suggested to this court. State v. Hammond, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 602</cite>, 125 S.E. 402 (1924).
   <br />

       General Verdict Sufficient for Conviction.
   
   - A general verdict of guilty, under evidence tending to show that the defendant unlawfully had in his possession, when not in his private dwelling, alcoholic beverages, under an indictment therefor, as well as for the unlawful receiving and transportation, was sufficient to sustain a conviction upon the count of possession prohibited.

       Erroneous Charge as to Separate Count Harmless.
   
   - Where a general verdict of guilty had been rendered against the defendant, upon competent evidence tending to show that he unlawfully had spirituous liquor in his possession, an erroneous charge as to receiving and transporting it was harmless error.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Harmless Error.
   
   - When a defendant was charged in two counts in the bill of indictment with separate offenses of the same grade, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to both counts, error in the trial of one count was harmless and did not entitle defendant to a new trial when such error did not affect the verdict on the other count.

      <p>
       Distinct Charges Supporting Separate Sentences.
   
   - A charge of unlawful possession of alcoholic beverages for the purpose of sale and a charge of unlawful sale of alcoholic beverages are distinct charges of separate offenses and support separate sentences by the court on a general plea of guilty.

      <p>
       Separate Punishment for Different Counts.
   
   - Upon a general verdict of guilty to and indictment charging separately unlawful possession of alcoholic beverages and unlawful transportation of alcoholic beverages, the court is empowered to assign separate punishment for each count, notwithstanding that the possession was physically necessary to the act of transporting.

       Co-permittees did, as a matter of law, knowingly allow the use of their premises for an unlawful purpose where their employee sold heroin on the premises,
   
   even though there was no evidence, other than the physical proximity of one co-permittee, that either co-permittee had actual knowledge of the transaction, since all acts of employees were imputed to the permittee for the purposes of former similar section.

       Effect of Article.
   
   - This Article does not create a new cause of claim for loss of support or death from injury to the underage person; rather, the plain language of the statute has the effect of eliminating the underage person's contributory negligence as a bar to an aggrieved party's cause of action against the local ABC Board or the permittee. If the three requirements of G.S. 18B-121 are met, an aggrieved party may recover for the loss of support or death of the underage person. Clark v. Inn West, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 365 S.E.2d 682, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 415</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 23 (1989) (holding an underaged person does not qualify as an aggrieved party.)
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative Intent.
   
   - While the Dram Shop Act, G.S. 18B-121, does require that the injury arise from an underage driver's "negligent" operation of a motor vehicle, the specific language of the statute does not create a cause of action against the negligent driver, but rather, G.S. 18B-121 clearly and unambiguously creates a cause of action only against a permittee or local alcoholic beverage control board; the intent of the Act, G.S. 18B-120 et seq., is only to enable an injured party to seek compensation from a permittee or alcohol beverage control board, and nothing in G.S. 18B-120 et seq. suggests a legislative intent to create new theories of liability against the negligent driver who causes the injury. Green v. Fishing Piers, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 714 S.E.2d 510 (2011).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (2) of this section abolishes the common law defense of contributory negligence insofar as an aggrieved party is concerned
   
   and must be strictly construed. Clark v. Inn West, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 365 S.E.2d 682, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 415</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 23 (1989) (holding an underaged person does not qualify as an aggrieved party.)
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       To recover under the Dram Shop Act, an individual must be an "aggrieved party" as defined by statute.

      <p>
       Parents as Aggrieved Parties.
   
   - Parents of an underage drinker who died from injuries proximately resulting from his operation of a motor vehicle while impaired after consuming alcohol negligently sold by a permittee may be included within the class of "aggrieved parties" under subdivision (1) of G.S. 18B-120, and may recover damages, including damages pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa18s28A-18-2ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-18-2(b)</a></cite>.

       Aggrieved Party Not Shown.
   
   - Where passenger/owner aided and abetted driver in the purchase of beer from store, he was not an "aggrieved party" within the meaning of the Dram Shop Act and his estate could not recover against seller under the Dram Shop Act. Estate of Darby v. Monroe Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 488 S.E.2d 828 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 397</cite>, 494 S.E.2d 602 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although passenger/owner of car did not contribute any money towards the purchase of alcohol, as he drove the purchaser to the store in his car, waited for the purchaser to return and allowed the purchaser to drive his car the passenger/owner aided and abetted in the purchase of the beer. Therefore, the claim against the store by passenger/owner's estate was barred as a matter of law by the "aided and abetted" exception to the definition of an "aggrieved party". Estate of Darby v. Monroe Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 488 S.E.2d 828 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 397</cite>, 494 S.E.2d 602 (1997).

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      An aggrieved party has a claim for relief for damages against a permittee or local Alcoholic Beverage Control Board if:
     </p>
     <ol>

       The permittee or his agent or employee or the local board or its agent or employee negligently sold or furnished an alcoholic beverage to an underage person; and
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba1As18B-121ol12">
       The consumption of the alcoholic beverage that was sold or furnished to an underage person caused or contributed to, in whole or in part, an underage driver's being subject to an impairing substance within the meaning of G.S. 20-138.1 at the time of the injury; and
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba1As18B-121ol13">

       Effect of Article.
   
   - This Article does not create a new cause of claim for loss of support or death from injury to the underage person; rather, the plain language of the statute has the effect of eliminating the underage person's contributory negligence as a bar to an aggrieved party's cause of action against the local ABC Board or the permittee. If the three requirements of this section are met, an aggrieved party may recover for the loss of support or death of the underage person. Clark v. Inn West, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 365 S.E.2d 682, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 415</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 23 (1989) (holding an underaged person does not qualify as an aggrieved party).

       Act Did Not Create Liability On Part Of A Driver's Estate.
   
   - Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of a driver's estate as to alcohol providers' third-party complaint because the providers erroneously contended that the Dram Shop Act, G.S. 18B-124, created liability on the part of the estate, and although the providers contended the driver was negligent as a matter of law, they did not indicate to whom the driver would be liable; because the Act, G.S. 18B-121, creates a cause of action against the permittee or a local alcohol beverage control board only, the theory by which the liability of a negligent driver is determined must arise from some other context, be it common law negligence, the Wrongful Death Act, or otherwise. Green v. Fishing Piers, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 714 S.E.2d 510 (2011).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       To recover under the Dram Shop Act, an individual must be an "aggrieved party" as defined by statute.

       Against Whom Claim May Be Had.
   
   - This section only allows a claim for relief against the local ABC Board or a permittee. Clark v. Inn West, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 365 S.E.2d 682, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 415</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 23 (1989) (holding an underaged person does not qualify as an aggrieved party).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Dram Shop Act, G.S. 18B-121, does require that the injury arise from an underage driver's "negligent" operation of a motor vehicle, the specific language of the statute does not create a cause of action against the negligent driver, but rather, G.S. 18B-121 clearly and unambiguously creates a cause of action only against a permittee or local alcoholic beverage control board; the intent of the Act, G.S. 18B-120 et seq., is only to enable an injured party to seek compensation from a permittee or alcohol beverage control board, and nothing in G.S. 18B-120 et seq. suggests a legislative intent to create new theories of liability against the negligent driver who causes the injury. Green v. Fishing Piers, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 714 S.E.2d 510 (2011).

       Personal Representative Is Not Aggrieved Party.
   
   - Personal representative of the estate of a 19-year-old who consumed alcoholic beverages and died from injuries sustained in a single-car accident could not recover damages under this section; since the decedent could not have maintained an action for his own injuries because an underage person is excluded from the definition of an aggrieved party in G.S. 18B-120(1), no claim survived his death, and therefore, his personal representative could not maintain an action under the Dram Shop Act. Clark v. Inn W., <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 415</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 23 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Aggrieved Party Not Shown.
   
   - Where passenger/owner aided and abetted driver in the purchase of beer from store, he was not an "aggrieved party" within the meaning of the Dram Shop Act and his estate could not recover against seller under the Dram Shop Act. Estate of Darby v. Monroe Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 488 S.E.2d 828 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 397</cite>, 494 S.E.2d 602 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although passenger/owner of car did not contribute any money towards the purchase of alcohol, as he drove the purchaser to the store in his car, waited for the purchaser to return and allowed the purchaser to drive his car the passenger/owner aided and abetted in the purchase of the beer. Therefore, the claim against the store by passenger/owner's estate was barred as a matter of law by the "aided and abetted" exception to the definition of an "aggrieved party". Estate of Darby v. Monroe Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 488 S.E.2d 828 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 397</cite>, 494 S.E.2d 602 (1997).

       Partners of Permittee Partnership as Proper Parties.
   
   - Though the individual partners of permittee partnership were not necessary parties to dram shop claim, they were proper parties. Clark v. Inn West, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 365 S.E.2d 682, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 415</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 23 (1989) (holding an underaged person does not qualify as an aggrieved party.)

       Punitive damages
   
   may be recovered against impaired drivers in certain situations without regard to the drivers' motives or intent. Huff v. Chrismon, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 525, 315 S.E.2d 711, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 756</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 134 (1984).

      <p>
       Claim Barred by Negligence.
   
   - Plaintiff's wrongful death claim against a provider of alcohol alleging wilful and wanton negligence for serving the visibly intoxicated decedent alcohol after being requested to refrain from serving him was barred by the decedent's own actions in driving his vehicle while highly intoxicated. Sorrells v. M.Y.B. Hospitality Ventures, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 645</cite>, 423 S.E.2d 72 (1992).

      </p>
      <p>
       Jury Instruction and Proximate Cause.
   
   - In a wrongful death suit based on a restaurant's serving alcohol to a minor, the jury was properly instructed on the restaurant's theory that the minor's intentionally chasing another car was unforeseeable, and thus the restaurant's serving alcohol to him was not the proximate cause of the injuries.

         Many of the cases below were decided under similar provisions of former Chapters 18 and 18A.
        </b>
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Section Empowers Commission to Issue Permits.
   
   - This section provides for the issuance of permits by the Commission, and except as authorized by the legally issued permit, sales, etc., of alcoholic beverages are made unlawful. Hursey v. Town of Gibsonville, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 522</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 161 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless Permit Authorizes Violation of Restrictions Fixed by Chapter.
   
   - The Commission has no power to issue a permit which authorizes the holder to violate the restrictions fixed by this Chapter. Hursey v. Town of Gibsonville, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 522</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 161 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Power of Investigation.
   
   - The Commission can conduct, without traditional probable cause, an investigation of a distillery representative's books and records pertaining to promotional activities in North Carolina for his employer. Myers v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 214 S.E.2d 630, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 664</cite>, 216 S.E.2d 907 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The investigative demand must be reasonable and specific in directive so that compliance is not unreasonably burdensome. Myers v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 214 S.E.2d 630, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 664</cite>, 216 S.E.2d 907 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The information sought must be relevant to a lawful subject of investigation. Myers v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 214 S.E.2d 630, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 664</cite>, 216 S.E.2d 907 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of an administrative investigation is to protect the public; therefore, the public's interest in applying more relaxed criteria for administrative investigations is greater than the regulated person's, firm's or corporation's right to privacy. Myers v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 214 S.E.2d 630, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 664</cite>, 216 S.E.2d 907 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission is not required to have evidence that petitioner has violated its rules and regulations before it undertakes an investigation of him. Myers v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 214 S.E.2d 630, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 664</cite>, 216 S.E.2d 907 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       An administrative agency is empowered to conduct inquiries to whatever extent is reasonably necessary to make the power of investigation effective. Myers v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 214 S.E.2d 630, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 664</cite>, 216 S.E.2d 907 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission, even if it has no probable cause, may require a distillery representative to produce relevant business books and records without abridging his constitutional rights under U.S. Const., Amend. IV. Myers v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 214 S.E.2d 630, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 664</cite>, 216 S.E.2d 907 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Due Process Required for License Revocation.
   
   - A license to engage in a business or practice a profession is a property right that cannot be suspended or revoked without due process of law. Myers v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 214 S.E.2d 630, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 664</cite>, 216 S.E.2d 907 (1975).

       Authority to Set Standards. - The Commission may set standards and adopt rules for malt beverages, unfortified wine, fortified wine, and spirituous liquor to protect the public against beverages containing harmful or impure substances, beverages containing an improper balance of substances as determined by the Commission, spurious or imitation beverages, and beverages unfit for human consumption. In setting standards and in issuing rules relating to them, the Commission may follow federal guidelines for standards of identity, labeling and advertising contained in Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or may adopt more restrictive standards.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba02s18B-206ol1b">
       Effective Date of Standards. - A person possessing alcoholic beverages which do not meet a new standard set by the Commission shall have 60 days after the effective date of the standard to sell or otherwise dispose of those alcoholic beverages.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba02s18B-206ol1c">
       Testing. - The Commission may test malt beverages, unfortified wine, fortified wine, and spirituous liquor possessed or offered for sale in this State to determine whether they meet the standards set by the Commission. If the Commission chooses to test an alcoholic beverage, that test may be performed by the Commission, the Commission may arrange for the State Chemist to perform the testing, or the Commission may have the testing performed in some other manner. The manufacturer of tested alcoholic beverages shall pay the costs of the test. In lieu of testing an alcoholic beverage, the Commission may rely on testing by a federal agency or an agency of another state or may accept test results from a federal agency, an agency of another state, or the manufacturer of the alcoholic beverage or his authorized agent. A manufacturer who submits test results shall also submit a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for each test result to cover administrative costs.

     <p>
      Session Laws 2017-87, s. 19(a), (b), provides: "(a) Except as otherwise provided, the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Commission shall adopt temporary rules to implement the provisions of this act. Temporary rules adopted in accordance with this section shall remain in effect until permanent rules that replace the temporary rules become effective.

      <p>
       The statutory scheme as set out in the present <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite>
   
   prohibits any sale, possession or giving of alcohol or malt beverages to an underaged person or aiding and abetting the sale or possession whether by a legally licensed commercial vendor, the county bootlegger or a neighbor down the street. Hart v. Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 403 S.E.2d 914, modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 299</cite>, 420 S.E.2d 174 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumption Does Not Qualify as Possession.
   
   - State did not provide substantial evidence sufficient to convict defendant of possession of a malt beverage by a person less than 21-years-old and, thus, defendant could not be convicted of that offense. Too, although defendant was charged with consumption of a malt beverage by a person less than 21-years-old in violation of G.S. 18B-302(b)(3), it did not pursue that charge at trial and consumption, which meant "to drink," did not qualify as possession such that defendant could be convicted of possessing a malt beverage based on defendant's consumption of it. State v. Hensley, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 661 S.E.2d 18 (2008).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Classification of Offense.
   
   - Trial court did not err in assigning one point in defendant's prior record level calculation under G.S. 15A-1340.14(b)(5) for conviction of purchase or possession of beer or wine under G.S. 18B-302, as any person who violated any provision of the chapter at issue was guilty of a class one misdemeanor. State v. Frady, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 623 S.E.2d 346 (2006).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation Not Negligence Per Se.
   
   - This section is not a public safety statute; a violation is not negligence per se. Hart v. Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 299</cite>, 420 S.E.2d 174 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute is not a public safety statute; thus, a violation of this section is not negligence per se. Estate of Mullis v. Monroe Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 277, 488 S.E.2d 830 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 196</cite>, 505 S.E.2d 131 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       A negligence per se claim could not have been maintained by the decedent against the vendors of alcoholic beverages based on the vendors' violation of the statute prohibiting sale of such beverages to underage persons; thus, the estate could not maintain wrongful death action. Estate of Mullis v. Monroe Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 196</cite>, 505 S.E.2d 131 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any violation or conspiracy by defendant-minor to violate this section did not constitute negligence per se. Smith v. Winn-Dixie Charlotte, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 542 S.E.2d 288 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 452</cite>, 548 S.E.2d 528 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty of Social Hosts Not to Serve to Intoxicated Person.
   
   - Defendants were under a duty to the people who travel on the public highways not to serve alcohol to an intoxicated individual who was known to be driving, and automobile accident victim stated a claim for relief based on established negligence principles. Hart v. Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 299</cite>, 420 S.E.2d 174 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Estate of accident victim could not maintain a wrongful death action against vendors
   
   where the estate could not show that had victim lived, she could have maintained a negligence per se action based on a violation of this section, or an action under common law negligence based on the selling of alcohol to underage persons in violation of G.S. 18B-102. Estate of Mullis v. Monroe Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 277, 488 S.E.2d 830 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 196</cite>, 505 S.E.2d 131 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Insufficient for Conviction.
   
   - Trial court should have granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge against defendant of possession of a malt beverage by a person less than 21-years-old in violation of G.S. 18B-302(b)(1) as the State did not introduce substantial evidence that defendant had actual or constructive possession of a beverage that qualified as a malt beverage. State v. Hensley, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 661 S.E.2d 18 (2008).

   - See State v. Hammond, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 602</cite>, 125 S.E. 402 (1924).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Prima Facie Evidence."
   
   - The words "prima facie evidence" are defined in Webster's International Dictionary as meaning "evidence sufficient, in law, to raise a presumption of fact or establish the fact in question, unless rebutted." It must presume that the legislature had such meaning in mind when such words were used in the statute. State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 482</cite>, 80 S.E. 66 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prima facie evidence neither conclusively determines the guilt or innocence of the party who is accused nor withdraws from the jury the right and duty of passing upon and deciding the issue to be tried. The burden of proof remains continually upon the State to establish the accusation which it makes, as prima facie evidence does not change or shift the burden. State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 482</cite>, 80 S.E. 66 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the prima facie case, unexplained, is sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty, yet the defendant is not required to show, by the greater weight of evidence, that the whiskey was in his possession for lawful purposes, for such, in effect, would require him to establish his own innocence and relieve the State of the burden of the issue, which is placed upon it. State v. Wilkerson, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 431</cite>, 79 S.E. 888 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is evidence that the defendant indicted under this section had in his possession sufficient spirituous liquors to raise the prima facie presumption that it was for the purpose of sale, it was competent to show this intent, and in furtherance of the presumption, that soon thereafter, about two months later, he was found working on a copper still on his premises, and had copper enough to make two of them; and that, upon his premises being searched, he had falsely denied the possession and had attempted to shoot the officer making the search. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 679</cite>, 100 S.E. 239 (1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       The possession of more than one gallon (now eight liters) of intoxicating (now spirituous) liquor is prima facie evidence of possession for the purpose of sale under this section, and is sufficient to take the case to the jury on the issue. State v. Tate, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 168</cite>, 185 S.E. 665 (1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for the unlawful possession of intoxicating (now spirituous) liquor for the purpose of sale, evidence that defendant, who resided four miles from the still, came to the still and got one-half gallon of nontaxpaid whiskey and left with it, is sufficient to make out a prima facie case for the jury. State v. Graham, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 347</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 151 (1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       For evidence sufficient to make out prima facie case against defendant, see State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 477</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 549 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to carry the case to the jury on the charge of unlawful possession of whiskey and beer for the purpose of sale. State v. Mills, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 237</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 329 (1957).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Power of Legislature to Change Rule of Evidence.
   
   - See full discussion in State v. Wilkerson, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 431</cite>, 79 S.E. 888 (1913).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession may be either actual or constructive
   
   within the meaning of this section. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 236</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 907 (1951); State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 499</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 355 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section intends that the "possession" shall be construed as either actual or constructive; so that the possession by the agent will be deemed the possession of the principal for the purpose of the act. State v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 533</cite>, 80 S.E. 405 (1913); State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 477</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 549 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence tending to show that 96 gallons of liquor were found in the basement of the tenant house on defendant's farm and tending to show that he alone had key to the door to the basement is sufficient to support constructive possession. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 236</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 907 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the liquor was within the power of the defendant, in such a sense that he could and did command its use, the possession was as complete within the meaning of the statute as if his possession had been actual. State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 477</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 549 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       If nontaxpaid whiskey is on a person's premises with his knowledge and consent, he has constructive possession thereof while it remains on premises under his exclusive control. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 593</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 728, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 820, 83 S. Ct. 36, 9 L. Ed. 2d 60 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession as Evidence of Sale.
   
   - See State v. McAllister, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 400</cite>, 121 S.E. 739 (1924); State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 630</cite>, 125 S.E. 406 (1924); State v. Pierce, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 766</cite>, 136 S.E. 121 (1926); State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 236</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 907 (1951).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession for Use of Owner.
   
   - The mere possession of spirituous liquor in the home for the use of the owner, his family and their guests on the premises in the absence of a count in the indictment charging that it was for prohibited purposes is not made unlawful. State v. Mull, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 668</cite>, 137 S.E. 866 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       The law permits an individual to possess in his home an unlimited quantity of taxpaid intoxicating (now spirituous) liquor for his own use and that of his bona fide guests, but the possession of more than one gallon (now eight liters) is prima facie evidence that such liquor is for the purpose of sale. State v. Causby, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 747</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 467 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession of Nontaxpaid Liquor.
   
   - Possession of nontaxpaid liquor is prima facie evidence that such liquor is kept for the purpose of being sold. State v. Tessnear, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 319</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 43 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       From the mere possession of nontaxpaid whiskey, this section authorizes, but does not compel, the jury to infer that the possessor intended to sell the whiskey. State v. Tessnear, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 319</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 43 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden of Proof.
   
   - The possession of the specified quantity of spirituous liquors sufficient to make out prima facie evidence of an unlawful purpose is only sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty, and does not shift the burden upon the defendant to show his innocence, and an instruction to that effect is reversible error. State v. Helms, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 566</cite>, 107 S.E. 228 (1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the possession of the specified quantities of intoxicating liquors under a statutory provision has made out prima facie evidence of guilt, and the defendant has not introduced evidence, an instruction to the jury placing the burden on the defendant to establish his innocence is reversible error, being equivalent to directing a verdict, which is not permissible in a criminal case. State v. Helms, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 566</cite>, 107 S.E. 228 (1921).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Sufficient to Warrant Finding that Possession Was for Purpose of Sale.
   
   - See State v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 112</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 819 (1951).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of Possession.
   
   - In a prosecution for illegal possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale, testimony concerning beer and wine found at defendant's home was competent as tending to show that defendant's possession of the intoxicating liquor was for the purpose of sale. State v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 274 S.E.2d 353 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The State's evidence was sufficient
   
   for the jury in a prosecution of defendant for illegal possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale where it tended to show that defendant had in his constructive possession more than four liters of liquor with an alcoholic content of greater than 21%. State v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 274 S.E.2d 353 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Sufficient to Support Adverse Verdict.
   
   - See State v. Gordon, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 304</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 43 (1944).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Sufficient to Overrule Nonsuit.
   
   - Evidence tending to show that defendant was driving his automobile on a highway, that when officers attempted to stop him he attempted to elude them, threw a carton containing three gallons of nontaxpaid whiskey from the car, and drove in a reckless manner until struck from rear by the officers' car and run off the road, was held sufficient to overrule nonsuit upon each of the charges of illegal possession of whiskey for the purpose of sale and unlawful transportation of same. State v. Merritt, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 59</cite>, 55 S.E.2d 804 (1949).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Insufficient Evidence to Direct Verdict.
   
   - Evidence establishing defendant's possession of more than a gallon of intoxicating (now spirituous) liquor, without other incriminating evidence, is insufficient to support a directed verdict of guilty of possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale under this section. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 166</cite>, 185 S.E. 663 (1936).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no fatal variance
   
   between a citation charging defendant with "possession of tax-paid whiskey for the purpose of sale that whiskey being intoxicating liquor" and a verdict finding defendant guilty of "possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale," since the reference in the citation to "tax-paid whiskey" was merely surplusage, and it was obvious that the jury found defendant guilty as charged. State v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 274 S.E.2d 353 (1981).

       Proof Needed for Violation of This Section.
   
   - For purposes of imposing civil liability, before a violation of this statute may be found, the plaintiff must allege and prove (1) that the patron was intoxicated and (2) that the licensee or permittee knew or should have known that the patron was in an intoxicated condition at the time he or she was served.

       Contributory Negligence as Defense.
   
   - Contributory negligence of plaintiffs' decedent, who was operating his vehicle in an impaired condition in violation of G.S. 20-138.1, was a defense to wrongful death claim under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa18s28A-18-2" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-18-2</a></cite> based on defendants' alleged negligence in selling alcohol to an intoxicated person. Clark v. Inn W., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 365 S.E.2d 682, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 415</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 23 (1989).

       <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa18s28A-18-2" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-18-2</a></cite> provides for survivorship of only those claims that could have been brought by the decedent herself had she lived; when a wrongful death claim is being brought by the administrator of the decedent's estate, the claim is subject to the affirmative defense of contributory negligence. Because the factual allegations of plaintiff's complaint establish the decedent's contributory negligence, Plaintiff's dram shop liability claim under G.S. 18B-305 failed. Davis v. Hulsing Enters., LLC, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 64, 810 S.E.2d 203 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly granted the hotel owners' motion to dismiss the husband's wrongful death claim where the decedent's consumption of alcohol and the owners' actions in serving the decedent rose to the same level of negligence, the decedent's resulting contributory negligence thereby barred the husband's common law dram shop claim. Davis v. Hulsing Enters., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 455</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 203 (2018).

       Minimum Evidence Required to Hold Nightclub Liable for Patron's Tort.
   
   - In a suit against a nightclub for liability in the death of a motorist in a collision with intoxicated patron, the irreducible minimum of evidence required of the plaintiff was to at least place the intoxicated patron upon the premises of the establishment which he was attempting to hold liable. Harshbarger v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 368 S.E.2d 450 (1988).

       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession, within the meaning of this section, may be either actual or constructive.
   
   State v. McLamb, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 251</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 537 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the property was within the power of the defendant in such a sense that he could and did command its use, the possession was as complete within the meaning of this section as if his possession had been actual. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 382</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 268 (1951); State v. McLamb, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 251</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 537 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession of Property Not Identical to Attempt.
   
   - An indictment charging the defendant with possession of property designed for the manufacture of intoxicating liquor is not identical with a charge or an attempt to commit a crime. State v. Jaynes, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. 728</cite>, 153 S.E. 410 (1930).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Process of Manufacturing Need Not Be Complete.
   
   - See State v. Horner, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 788</cite>, 94 S.E. 291 (1917).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Accessories Equally Guilty.
   
   - A defendant guilty of aiding and abetting the unlawful manufacture of liquor is equally guilty with those who actually operated the still. State v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 733</cite>, 110 S.E. 641 (1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant, convicted on his trial of aiding or abetting in the manufacture of whiskey on one count of the indictment, could not complain because he was tried on another count of the same bill for the unlawful manufacture of liquor and acquitted, there being sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction on each one. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 725</cite>, 110 S.E. 654 (1922).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Arrest Without Warrant.
   
   - An alcoholic beverage control officer who saw defendant at the still unlawfully engaged in the manufacture of whiskey had a lawful right to arrest defendant there without a warrant. State v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 441</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 169 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       It was proper to reject evidence
   
   as to the quantity of cotton or corn defendant, tried for unlawful manufacture of liquor, etc., had raised on his farm that year. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 725</cite>, 110 S.E. 654 (1922).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A plea of not guilty
   
   under this section puts in issue every element of the offense charged. State v. McLamb, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 251</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 537 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Insufficiency of Charge Not Such as to Warrant Sustaining Motion in Arrest of Judgment.
   
   - See State v. McLamb, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 251</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 537 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence
   
   of the defendant's guilt of possessing parts of a still intended for the purpose of manufacturing alcoholic beverages was sufficient to be submitted to the jury and to sustain their verdict of guilty, and the fact that the parts had not been assembled into a distillery is immaterial under the language of the statute. State v. Jaynes, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. 728</cite>, 153 S.E. 410 (1930).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Question for Jury.
   
   - Where there was evidence of defendant's guilty knowledge in aiding in the distilling or manufacturing of alcoholic beverages by hauling it away, and also evidence consistent with his innocence in merely hauling away the remnants after the illegal purpose had been accomplished or frustrated, without intention of taking part or aiding in its manufacture, the question of his guilt or innocence was one for the jury, under proper instructions. State v. Horner, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 788</cite>, 94 S.E. 291 (1917).

      <p>
       Constitutionality of Former G.S. 18A-26.
   
   - There exists a "reasonable basis" for distinguishing transportation of alcoholic beverages in a for-hire passenger vehicle from other modes of transportation. Former G.S. 18A-26 was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to defendants. State v. Terry, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 226 S.E.2d 846 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Guilty Knowledge.
   
   - This section must be interpreted in the light of the common-law principle that guilty knowledge is an essential element of crime, and therefore a person cannot be held guilty of illegally transporting intoxicating liquors if he has no knowledge of the nature of the goods transported. State v. Welch, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 77</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 199 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) only forbids consumption.
   
   - It is the consumption of malt beverage in the passenger area of a vehicle while driving it that subsection (a) of this statute forbids, not possession or transportation. State v. Poczontek, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 368 S.E.2d 659 (1988).

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1a">
       Appointment. - Except as provided in subsection (f), each local board shall hire one or more ABC enforcement officers. Local ABC enforcement officers shall be designated as "ABC Officers". The local board may designate one officer as the chief ABC officer for that board.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1b">
       Subject Matter Jurisdiction. - After taking the oath prescribed for a peace officer, a local ABC officer may arrest and take other investigatory and enforcement actions for any criminal offense; however, the primary responsibility of a local ABC officer is enforcement of the ABC laws and Article 5 of Chapter 90 (The Controlled Substances Act).
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1c">
       Territorial Jurisdiction. - A local ABC officer has jurisdiction anywhere in the county in which he is employed except that a city ABC officer's territorial jurisdiction is subject to any limitation included in any local act governing that city ABC system. A local ABC officer may pursue outside his normal territorial jurisdiction anyone who commits an offense within that jurisdiction, as provided in G.S. 15A-402(d).
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1d">
       Assisting Other Local Agencies. - The local ABC officers employed by a local board shall constitute a "law-enforcement agency" for purposes of G.S. 160A-288, and a local board shall have the same authority as a city or county governing body to approve cooperation between law-enforcement agencies under that section.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1e">
       Assisting State and Federal Enforcement. - A local ABC officer may assist State and federal law-enforcement agencies in the investigation of criminal offenses in North Carolina, under the following conditions:
       <ol>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1e1">
         The local board employing the officer has adopted a resolution approving such assistance and stating the conditions under which it may be provided;
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1e2">
         The State or federal agency has made a written request for assistance from that local board, either for a particular investigation or for any investigation that might require assistance within a certain period of time;
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1e3">
         The local ABC officer is supervised by someone in the requesting agency; and
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1e4">
         As soon as practical after the assistance begins, an acknowledgement of the action is placed in the records of the local board.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1f">
       Contracts with Other Agencies. - Instead of hiring local ABC officers, a local board may contract to pay its enforcement funds to a sheriff's department, city police department, or other local law-enforcement agency for enforcement of the ABC laws within the law-enforcement agency's territorial jurisdiction. Enforcement agreements may be made with more than one agency at the same time. When such a contract for enforcement exists, the designated officers of the contracting law-enforcement agency shall have the same authority to inspect under G.S. 18B-502 that an ABC officer employed by that local board would have. An agency contracted to provide ABC law enforcement shall designate no more than five officers to conduct inspections pursuant to this section and G.S. 18B-502. If a city located in two or more counties approves the sale of some type of alcoholic beverage pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 18B-600(e4), and there are no local ABC boards established in the city and one of the counties in which the city is located, the local ABC board of any county in which the city is located may enter into an enforcement agreement with the city's police department for enforcement of the ABC laws within the entire city, including that portion of the city located in the county of the ABC board entering into the enforcement agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1-f1">
       Accountability; Enforcement Reports. - To ensure accountability to the appointing authority and the Commission, every local board's ABC officers and those law enforcement agencies subject to an enforcement agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall report to the local board, by the fifth business day of each month, on a form developed by the Commission, the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1-f11">
         The number of arrests made for ABC law, Controlled Substance Act, or other violations, by category, at ABC permitted outlets.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1-f12">
         The number of arrests made for ABC law, Controlled Substance Act, or other violations, by category, at other locations.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1-f13">
         The number of agencies assisted with ABC law or controlled substance related matters.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1-f14">
         The number of alcohol education and responsible server programs presented.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-501ol1g">
       Discharge. - Local ABC officers and the designated officers of agencies which contract with local boards for enforcement of the ABC laws are subject to the discharge and ineligibility provisions of G.S. 18B-202.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A local ABC officer shall have territorial jurisdiction throughout North Carolina while assisting a State or federal agency under this section. While providing that assistance the officer shall continue to be considered an employee of the local board for purposes of salary, worker's compensation, and other benefits, unless a different arrangement is negotiated between the local board and the requesting agency.

       Scope of Waiver as to Searches.
   
   - Although defendant, as holder of an ABC permit, waived his Fourth Amendment rights as to searches and seizures by officers incident to enforcement of ABC regulations, this waiver did not extend to a warrantless search of items unconnected with the ABC regulatory scheme, such as closed film canisters. State v. Sapatch, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 321, 423 S.E.2d 510 (1992).

       Search of Living Quarters Attached to ABC Storefront.
   
   - Denial of defendant's motion to suppress was appropriate because North Carolina Alcohol Law Enforcement agents first obtained consent from defendant's wife to search the living quarters attached to an Alcoholic Beverage Control licensed storefront and then obtained a search warrant to search a recording studio in the quarters when defendant objected.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1a">
       Storage. - A law-enforcement officer who seizes alcoholic beverages as evidence of an ABC law violation shall provide for the storage of those alcoholic beverages until the commencement of the trial or administrative hearing relating to the violation, unless some other disposition is authorized under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1b">
       Disposition Before Trial. - After giving notice to each defendant, to any other known owner, and to the Commission, a judge may order any of the following dispositions of alcoholic beverages seized as evidence of an ABC law violation:
       <ol>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1b1">
         The destruction of any malt beverages except that amount needed for evidence at trial.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1b2">
         The sale of any alcoholic beverages other than malt beverages or nontaxpaid alcoholic beverages, and other than any alcoholic beverages needed for evidence at trial, if the trial is likely to be delayed for more than 90 days, or if the quantity or nature of the alcoholic beverages is such that storage is impractical or unduly expensive.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1b3">
         The destruction of the alcoholic beverages if storage or sale is not practical.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1b4">
         Continued storage of the alcoholic beverages.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1c">
       Disposition After Trial. - After the criminal charge is resolved, a judge may order the following dispositions of seized alcoholic beverages:
       <ol>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1c1">
         If the owner or possessor of the alcoholic beverages is found guilty of a criminal charge relating to those alcoholic beverages, the judge may order the sale or destruction of any alcoholic beverages that were held until trial.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1c2">
         If the owner or possessor of the alcoholic beverages is found not guilty, or if charges are dismissed or otherwise resolved in favor of the owner or possessor, the judge shall order the alcoholic beverages returned to that owner or possessor, except as provided in subdivision (3).
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1c3">
         If the owner or possessor of the alcoholic beverages is found not guilty, or if charges are otherwise resolved in favor of the owner or possessor, but possession of the alcoholic beverages by that owner or possessor would be unlawful, the judge shall order the alcoholic beverages either sold or destroyed.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1c4">
         If ownership of the alcoholic beverages remains uncertain after trial or after the charges have been dismissed, the judge may order the alcoholic beverages held, or the alcoholic beverages sold and the proceeds held, for a specified time, until ownership of the alcoholic beverages can be determined.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1d">
       Holding for Administrative Hearings. - If alcoholic beverages used as evidence in a criminal proceeding are also needed as evidence at an administrative hearing, a judge shall not order any of the dispositions set out in subsection (c), but shall order the alcoholic beverages held for the administrative hearing and for a determination of final disposition by the Commission. The Commission may, before or after an administrative hearing, order any of the dispositions authorized under subsections (b) and (c). If no related criminal proceeding has commenced, the Commission shall not order sale or destruction of alcoholic beverages until notice has been given to the district attorney for the district where the alcoholic beverages were seized or any violation of ABC laws related to the seizure of the alcoholic beverages is likely to be prosecuted.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1e">
       Sale Procedure. - The sale of unfortified wine or fortified wine shall be by public auction unless those wines would likely become spoiled or lose value in the time required to arrange a public auction. If spoilage or loss of value is likely, the judge ordering the sale or the Commission may authorize sale at the prevailing wholesale price, as determined by the Commission, to one or more persons holding the appropriate retail wine permits in the county in which the wine was seized, or in a neighboring county if there are no such persons in the county in which the wine was seized. Spirituous liquor may be sold only to the local ABC board serving the city or county in which the liquor was seized, or, if there is no local board for that city or county, to the nearest local board. The sale price shall be at least ten percent (10%) less than the price the local board would pay for the same liquor bought through the State warehouse.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1f">
       Sale Proceeds. - An agency selling alcoholic beverages seized under the provisions of this Chapter shall keep the proceeds in a separate account until some other disposition is ordered by a judge or the Commission. In a criminal proceeding, if the owner or possessor of the alcoholic beverages is found guilty of a violation relating to seizure of the alcoholic beverages, if the owner or possessor is found not guilty or the charge is dismissed or otherwise resolved in favor of the owner or possessor, but the possession of the alcoholic beverages by that owner or possessor would be unlawful, or if the ownership of the alcoholic beverages cannot be determined, the proceeds from the sale of those alcoholic beverages shall be paid to the school fund of the county in which the alcoholic beverages were seized. If the owner or possessor of alcoholic beverages seized for violation of the ABC laws is found not guilty of criminal charges relating to the seizure of those beverages or the charge is dismissed or otherwise resolved in favor of the owner or possessor, and if possession of the alcoholic beverages by that owner or possessor was lawful when the beverages were seized, the proceeds from the sale of those alcoholic beverages shall be paid to the owner or possessor. The agency making the sale may deduct and retain from the amount to be placed in the county school fund the costs of storing the seized alcoholic beverages and of conducting the sale, but may not deduct those costs from the amount to be turned over to an owner or possessor of the alcoholic beverages.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1g">
       Court Action by Owner. - Any person who claims any of the following resulting from the seizure of alcoholic beverages may bring an action in the superior court of the county in which the alcoholic beverages were seized:
       <ol>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1g1">
         To be the owner of alcoholic beverages that are wrongfully held.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1g2">
         To be the owner of alcoholic beverages that are needed as evidence in another proceeding.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-503ol1g3">
         To be entitled to proceeds from a sale of seized alcoholic beverages.

       Legislative Intent.
   
   - The statutes seem to indicate the legislative intent to be that liquor itself, when the subject of unlawful traffic and capable of harmful effects, offends the law and should be regarded as a nuisance and contraband, to be summarily destroyed or otherwise disposed of. Only in case of failure to establish a violation of the law is the restoration of the liquor permitted. However, the processes of the courts are available to anyone legally interested to present his claim for seized liquor, and his plea will be heard. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 314</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 158 (1944) (decided under similar provisions of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18</a></cite>).

         Motor vehicles, boats, airplanes, and all other conveyances used to transport nontaxpaid alcoholic beverages in violation of the ABC laws;

       Exemption for Forfeiture. - Property which may be possessed lawfully shall not be subject to forfeiture when it was used unlawfully by someone other than the owner of the property and the owner did not consent to the unlawful use.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1c">
       Seizure of Property. - If property subject to forfeiture has not already been seized as part of an arrest or search, a law-enforcement officer may apply to a judge for an order authorizing seizure of that property. An order for seizure may be issued only after criminal process has been issued for an ABC law violation in connection with that property. The order shall describe the property to be seized and shall state the facts establishing probable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1d">
       Custody until Trial. - A law-enforcement officer seizing property subject to forfeiture shall provide for its safe storage until trial. The officer may destroy stills and perishable materials seized under subdivision (a)(3), if storage is impractical and if the absence of the property will not be likely to adversely affect the defendant's right to defend against the charge that is the basis for the forfeiture. If the officer having custody of the property is satisfied that it will be returned at the time of trial, he may return the property to the owner upon receiving a bond for the value of the property, signed by sufficient sureties. If the property is not returned at the time of trial, the full amount of the bond shall be forfeited to the court. Property which it is unlawful to possess may not be returned to the owner.

        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1e3">
         If ownership of the property remains uncertain after trial, the judge may order the property held for a specified time to determine ownership. If the judge finds that ownership cannot be determined with reasonable effort, the judge shall order the property forfeited.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1e4">

        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1e5">
         If the property is also needed as evidence at an administrative hearing, the judge shall provide that the order does not go into effect until the Commission determines that the property is no longer needed for the administrative proceeding.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1f">

       </ol>
      </li>

       Innocent Parties. - At any time before forfeiture is ordered, an owner of seized property or a holder of a security interest in seized property, other than the defendant, may apply to protect his interest in the property. The application may be made to any judge who has jurisdiction to try the offense with which the property is associated. If the judge finds that the property owner or holder of a security interest did not consent to the unlawful use of the property, and that the property may be possessed lawfully by the owner or holder, the judge may order:
       <ol>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1h1">
         That the property be returned to the owner, if it is not needed as evidence at trial;
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1h2">
         That the property be returned to the owner following trial or other resolution of the case; or
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1h3">
         That, if the property is sold following trial, a specified sum be paid from the proceeds of that sale to the holder of the security interest.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1i">
       Defendant Unavailable. - When property is seized for forfeiture, but the owner is unknown, the district attorney may seek forfeiture under this section by an action in rem against the property. If the owner is known and has been charged with an offense, but is unavailable for trial, the district attorney may seek forfeiture either by an action in rem against the property or by motion in the criminal action.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba05s18B-504ol1j">
       When No Charge is Made. - Any owner of property seized for forfeiture may apply to a judge to have the property returned to him if no criminal charge has been made in connection with that property within a reasonable time after seizure. The judge may not order the return of the property if possession by the owner would be unlawful.

        Constitutionality of Former Section.

        Legislative Intent.
   
   - The plain language of this section indicates the legislature intended judges alone should pass on whether a claimant to an interest in seized property is entitled to relief. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 405 S.E.2d 351 (1991).

        No Right to Jury.
   
   - Alcohol-related forfeitures are now controlled by G.S. 18B-504, which contains no provision explicitly granting a jury trial. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 405 S.E.2d 351 (1991).

         II. SEARCHES.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        No search warrant is required where the owner or person in charge consents
   
   to the search. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 293</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 736 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to conduct amounting to voluntary consent to search, see State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 293</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 736 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Or Where Officer Sees or Has Absolute Personal Knowledge of Presence of Liquor.
   
   - No search warrant is required where the officer sees or has absolute personal knowledge that there is liquor in an automobile. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 293</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 736 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional and statutory guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure does not prohibit seizure of evidence and its introduction into evidence on a subsequent prosecution where no search is required. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        When officers saw the liquid in containers generally used to contain and transport nontaxpaid liquor, under the circumstances then existing, they had sufficient reasonable cause to believe that the jars contained nontaxpaid liquor to justify the seizure of the contraband without a search warrant. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Seizure of contraband does not require a warrant when its presence is fully disclosed without necessity of search. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an officer saw nontaxpaid liquor clearly visible in a defendant's car, it became his duty to take possession of the automobile and the liquor found therein and to arrest the defendant. It was his duty to act either with or without the aid of a search warrant. State v. Harper, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 67</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 164 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        If an officer saw and had absolute personal knowledge that there was intoxicating liquor in the automobile, it necessarily follows that a defendant's exception based on the court's refusal to suppress the evidence should be overruled. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 259, 178 S.E.2d 90 (1970), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the incriminating article is in plain view of the officers, no search warrant is necessary and the constitutional guaranty does not apply. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 259, 178 S.E.2d 90 (1970), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        No search warrant was required for the seizure from defendant's car of white plastic jugs containing nontaxpaid whiskey where the jugs were in plain view of the officers from outside the car and no search was necessary for their discovery, and the trial court did not err in the admission of the whiskey and testimony relating to it. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 259, 178 S.E.2d 90 (1970), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant, in operating his automobile in excess of 55 miles an hour in a 35 mile zone on the public streets in a city, committed a misdemeanor in the presence of the city police officers, and they had a right to pursue him and arrest him without a warrant. Consequently, after the defendant was taken into custody, it was the duty of the officers to return to defendant's car and to see that it was taken care of and not abandoned. If, upon approaching the automobile, the officers detected the smell of liquor or other alcoholic beverages therein, it was their duty to take possession of the car and seize the liquor without first obtaining a search warrant. State v. Giles, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 499</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 394 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Or Has Reasonable Grounds for Belief.
   
   - A search warrant was not necessary to search a suitcase for intoxicating liquor carried by the defendant after arrest, when, under the circumstances, the officer had reasonable grounds for belief that it contained alcoholic beverages. State v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 747</cite>, 143 S.E. 538 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Automobiles and other conveyances may be searched without a warrant under circumstances that would not justify the search of a house, and a police officer in the exercise of his duties may search an automobile or other conveyance without a search warrant when the existing facts and circumstances are sufficient to support a reasonable belief that the automobile or other conveyance carries contraband materials. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Search without Warrant.
   
   - Officers have no authority to search a car without a warrant, where they do not see or have absolute personal knowledge that there are alcoholic beverages in the car. State v. Godette, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 497</cite>, 125 S.E. 24 (1924); State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 692</cite>, 135 S.E. 866 (1926); State v. DeHerrodora, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 749</cite>, 136 S.E. 6 (1926).

        Arrest without Warrant.
   
   - Where there was evidence that, acting upon information previously received that alcoholic beverages were being unlawfully transported, the proper officers of the law laid in wait for and followed automobile and saw containers and smelled the liquor, they had a right to arrest without warrant and seize the vehicle. State v. Godette, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 497</cite>, 125 S.E.2d 24 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an arrest by an officer of the law without a warrant was valid, it could not successfully be maintained that evidence thereof should have been excluded. State v. Godette, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 497</cite>, 125 S.E. 24 (1924).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence Required to Hold Passenger.
   
   - To hold a mere passenger, under this section, showing that he had knowledge of the presence in the automobile of contraband whiskey is insufficient. The evidence must be sufficient to support an inference of some form of control, joint or otherwise, over the automobile or the liquor. State v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 656</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 911 (1953); State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 293</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 736 (1961).

        This section does not provide for seizure of all alcoholic beverages found in vehicle,

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Confiscation and Forfeiture Are Mandatory.
   
   - Where one who was in possession of seized liquor at the time he was arrested for unlawful acts with respect thereto pleads guilty to charges of unlawful possession and unlawful transportation of this liquor and thereupon personal judgment is rendered against him, the provisions of this section are mandatory that the judgment also order the confiscation and forfeiture of the liquor so unlawfully possessed and transported.

       <p>
        Order Confiscating Car.
   
   - Defendant admitted ownership of the car in which two bottles of nontaxpaid whiskey were being transported at the time of his arrest, and he was found guilty of unlawful transportation of alcoholic beverages. This was held sufficient to sustain the court's order confiscating his car and ordering it sold. State v. Vanhoy, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 162</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 278 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Order for Forfeiture Nunc Pro Tunc.
   
   - Where defendant has been convicted of illegal transportation of nontaxpaid liquor, the court may at a subsequent term enter an order nunc pro tunc for the forfeiture and sale of the vehicle used for such transportation. State v. Maynor, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 645</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 833 (1946).

       <p>
        Liability of Sheriff for Destruction of Vehicle.
   
   - In a case arising prior to this section it was held that, where the sheriff took an automobile in custody, under a corresponding statute, and while he was holding it in a storage garage according to law it was destroyed by fire through no fault of his, he was not liable on his forthcoming bond. T. &amp; H. Motor Co. v. Sands, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 732</cite>, 120 S.E. 459 (1923).

       Membership. - A local ABC board shall consist of three or five members appointed for three-year terms unless the board is a board for a merged ABC system under G.S. 18B-703 and a different size membership has been provided for as part of the negotiated merger. If the board is a three-member board, one member of the initial board of a newly created ABC system shall be appointed for a three-year term, one member for a two-year term, and one member for a one-year term. If the board is a five-member board, one member of the initial board of a newly created ABC system shall be appointed for a three-year term, two members for two-year terms, and two members for one-year terms. As the terms of initial board members expire, their successors shall each be appointed for three-year terms. If a board is initially a three-member board and the appointing authority determines a five-member board is preferable, the terms of the two new members shall be for three years. If a local board has five members and the appointing authority determines a three-member board is preferable, the appointing authority shall not reduce the size of the board except upon the expiration of a member's term and only with the approval of the Commission.

       Limit on Creation of New Boards. - Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no new local board may be created in any county where a local board operates an ABC store. If a jurisdiction holds an ABC store election under G.S. 18B-602(g), the establishment of ABC stores is approved, and the jurisdiction is located in a county where a local board is already in operation, the jurisdiction that held the election shall enter into an agreement with an existing local board to create a merged local board in accordance with G.S. 18B-703.

The local board shall annually provide the appointing authority's written confirmation of such approval to the Commission and a copy of the travel policy authorized by the appointing authority. Any excess expenses not covered by the local board's travel policy shall only be paid with the written authorization of the appointing authority's finance officer.

The budget shall authorize all financial transactions of the local board. The budget may be in any form that the board considers most efficient in enabling it to make the fiscal policy decisions embodied therein, but it shall make appropriations by department, function, or project and show revenues by major source. The following directions and limitations shall bind the local board in adopting the budget:
       <ol>
        <li id="t18Ba07s18B-702ol1g1">
         The full amount estimated by the finance officer to be required for debt service during the budget year shall be appropriated.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba07s18B-702ol1g2">
         The full amount of any deficit in each fund shall be appropriated.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba07s18B-702ol1g3">
         Working capital funds set aside pursuant to G.S. 18B-805 shall be established by rule of the Commission. "Working capital" means the total of cash, investments, and inventory less all unsecured liabilities. Gross sales means gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages less distributions as defined in G.S. 18B-805(b)(2), (3), (4), and (5). Any expenditure to be charged against working capital funds shall be authorized by resolution of the local board, which resolution shall be deemed an amendment to the budget setting up an appropriation for the object of expenditure authorized. The local board may authorize the budget officer to authorize expenditures from working capital funds subject to such limitations and procedures as it may prescribe. Any such expenditure shall be deemed an amendment and reported to the board at its next regular meeting and recorded in the minutes.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba07s18B-702ol1g4">
         Estimated revenues shall include only those revenues reasonably expected to be realized in the budget year.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba07s18B-702ol1g5">
         Sufficient funds to meet the amounts to be paid during the fiscal year under continuing contracts previously entered into shall be appropriated unless such contract reserves to the local board the right to limit or not to make such appropriation.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba07s18B-702ol1g6">
         The sum of estimated net revenues and appropriated fund balance in each fund shall be equal to appropriations in that fund. Appropriated fund balance in a fund shall not exceed the sum of cash and investments minus the sum of liabilities, encumbrances, and deferred revenues arising from cash receipts, as those figures stand at the close of the fiscal year next preceding the budget year.

      <li id="t18Ba07s18B-702ol1h">
       Amendments to the Budget. - Except as otherwise restricted by law, the local board may amend the budget at any time after adoption, in any manner, so long as the budget, as amended, continues to satisfy the requirements of this section. The local board by appropriate resolution may authorize the budget officer to transfer monies from one appropriation to another within the same fund subject to such limitations and procedures as it may prescribe. Any such transfers shall be reported to the local board at its next regular meeting and shall be entered in the minutes. Amendments to the adopted budget shall also be provided to the appointing authority and the Commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba07s18B-702ol1i">
       Interim Budget. - In case the adoption of the budget is delayed until after July 1, the local board shall make interim appropriations for the purpose of paying salaries, debt service payments, and the usual ordinary expenses of the local board for the interval between the beginning of the budget year and the adoption of the budget. Interim appropriations so made shall be charged to the proper appropriations in the adopted budget.

       Finance Officer. - Except as otherwise provided, the local board shall designate (i) a part-time or full-time employee of the board other than the general manager or (ii) the finance officer of the appointing authority with consent of the appointing authority to be the finance officer for the local board. The Commission, for good cause shown, may grant a waiver to allow the general manager of a board also to be the finance officer. Good cause includes, but is not limited to, the fact that the board operates no more than two stores, and any approval for the general manager also to be the finance officer shall apply until the board operates more than two stores; in any event, the approval shall be effective for 36 months. The Commission may grant one or more waivers to a board.

       Distribution of Profits. - Before merger, the cities or counties involved shall agree upon a formula for distribution of the profits of the new merged ABC system, based as closely as practicable on the distribution previously authorized for the separate systems.

      <li id="t18Ba07s18B-704ol1e">
       Removal Hearing. - Any local board member or employee removed from office or discharged by the Commission or the appointing authority may request a hearing before the Commission. Such a request operates to stay the action of the Commission or the appointing authority with regard to the matter until after the hearing, unless the Commission finds that the public interest requires immediate action. At the hearing, the employee or the employee's counsel may examine all evidence used against the employee and present evidence in the employee's own behalf. A removal hearing is not subject to the provisions of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes. All hearings shall be conducted informally and in such manner as to preserve the substantial rights of the parties.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba07s18B-704ol1f">
       Hearing Procedure. - The Commission shall hold the hearing required by subsection (e) of this section within 15 days of the member's or employee's request for a hearing. The standard of review by the Commission is de novo. The Commission or appointing authority shall be represented by a Commission hearing officer. The Commission shall discharge the member or employee if two-thirds of the Commission's members vote for removal. The Commission shall make findings of fact. The Commission may adopt the findings of fact of the Commission or the appointing authority, may add new findings of fact to the original findings of fact, or may substitute new findings of fact for the original findings of fact. The Commission shall make conclusions of law and shall issue a written decision to the member or employee of the local board, and to the appointing authority, within 15 days of the hearing.

      <li id="t18Ba07s18B-704ol1g">
       Commission Authority. - The Commission shall have the sole power, in its discretion, to determine if cause exists for removal of a local board member or employee who has requested a hearing before the Commission. The Commission's decision in a removal hearing is final.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba07s18B-704ol1h">
       Appeal. - A local board member or employee may appeal the Commission's final decision to the Court of Appeals. The standard of review for an appeal shall be abuse of discretion. The sole remedy for a local board member or employee shall be the reinstatement of the board member or employee to the local board with back pay. All awards for back pay shall be paid by the local board from which the board member or employee was removed.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba07s18B-704ol1i">
       Removal Hearing Not a Substitute for Termination of Employee. -  Nothing in this section replaces or is intended to replace a local board's policy regarding the termination of an employee for personnel reasons. The removal process under this section is reserved solely for the appointing authority or the Commission to remove a board member or employee for cause.

       Local Board Compliance. - The Commission shall establish performance standards pursuant to G.S. 18B-203(a)(20). The Commission shall ensure that all local boards comply with established performance standards by conducting regular or special audits, conducting performance evaluations, or taking other measures, which may include inspections by Commission auditors or alcohol law enforcement agents.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba07s18B-705ol1b">
       Performance Improvement Plans. - The Commission, upon determining that a local board is failing to meet performance standards established pursuant to G.S. 18B-203(a)(20), shall meet with the chair of the local board and the appointing authority and issue a statement of findings. The appointing authority, in consultation with the Commission and the local board, shall develop and deliver a performance improvement plan to the local board within 60 days of the meeting with the Commission. The performance improvement plan shall include, but not be limited to, recommendations for improved performance based on the performance standards established by the Commission. The plan shall also state a period of time in which the performance improvements are to occur and what action will be taken by the Commission if performance standards are not met within the given time limits. The appointing authority shall allow up to, but no more than, 12 months' time to the local board to implement and show improvement under the performance improvement plan. The local appointing authority, in consultation with the Commission and upon good cause shown, may allow up to an additional six-month period of time for the local board to meet all requirements in the performance improvement plan and to establish that the performance standards established by the Commission are met.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba07s18B-705ol1c">
       Remedies. - If the Commission determines that the established performance standards identified in the statement of findings cannot be met after a performance improvement plan has been implemented and adequate time has been given, but in no case less than 12 months, the Commission shall take appropriate action to avoid insolvency. This action may include closing the board pursuant to G.S. 18B-801(d), closing a store or multiple stores, or merging the local board with another local board in order to maintain solvency. The Commission may also seize the assets of the local board and liquidate any assets necessary to satisfy any debt in order to maintain the solvency of the local board. Prior to taking action pursuant to this subsection, the Commission shall issue a notice of intent to take such action to the appointing authority and the local board.

       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - This section was amended by Session Laws 2019-49, s. 2, in the coded bill drafting format provided by G.S. 120-20.1. In subdivision (a)(1), Session Laws 2019-49, s. 2 failed to strike through the text "selling only malt beverages and unfortified wine."
   Subdivision (a)(1) has been set out in the form above at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2019-49, s. 10, made the amendment to subdivision (a)(1) and subsection (c) of this section by Session Laws 2019-49, s. 2, effective June 26, 2019, and applicable to new permits issued on or after that date, and further provided, in part: "Permits issued to private clubs as defined in G.S. 18B-1000(5) prior to the effective date of this act shall be grandfathered and may remain in effect and eligible for renewal as a private bar under G.S. 18B-1005(4a) or a private club under G.S. 18B-1005(5), as applicable, notwithstanding Section 5 of this act." Section 5 of Session Laws 2019-49 amended the definitions for "Private bar" and "Private club."
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Effect of Amendments.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 2004-203, s. 25(a), effective August 17, 2004, added "except where the revocation was based solely on a permittee's failure to pay the annual registration and inspection fee required in G.S. 18B-903(b1)." in subdivision (a)(6); and made a minor punctuation change.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2014-3, s. 10.1(a), effective May 1, 2015, in subsection (a), substituted "must satisfy all of the following requirements" for "shall" in the introductory language, added subdivision (a)(8), and made minor punctuation and stylistic changes; and added subsection (f).
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2019-49, s. 2, effective June 26, 2019, rewrote subdivision (a)(1), which formerly read "Be at least 21 years old, unless the person is a manager of a business in which case the person shall be at least 19 years old"; inserted "or she" following "he" in subdivision (c)(3); rewrote (c)(4), which formerly read: "The manager of an establishment operated by a corporation other than an establishment with only off-premises malt beverage, off-premises unfortified wine, or off-premises fortified wine permits"; added subdivision (c)(6); and made stylistic changes. For effective date and applicability, see editor's note.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2021-88, s. 4(b), effective July 22, 2021, rewrote the section.

       ABC Permit Preempts Municipal Zoning Ordinance.
   
   - In case in which petitioner, without objection by respondent board, argued that the decision of the ABC Commission to grant him a permit preempted respondent's denial of his special exception use permit request since the zoning ordinance, upon which respondent's denial was based, attempted to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages, which is a violation of State law, the trial court did not err in concluding that petitioner, as the holder of a valid ABC permit issued by the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, was entitled to be issued a city beer license, and in ordering the tax collector of the city to issue any city license. Melkonian v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 355 S.E.2d 503, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 631</cite>, 360 S.E.2d 91 (1987).

     </h3>
     <p>
      When an application has been received in proper form, with the required application fee, the Commission may issue a temporary permit for any of the activities for which permits are authorized under G.S. 18B-1001 and 18B-1100. A temporary permit may be revoked summarily by the Commission without complying with the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite>. Revocation of a temporary permit shall be effective upon service of the notice of revocation upon the permittee or upon the expiration of three working days after the notice of the revocation has been mailed to the permittee at either his residence or the address given for the business in the permit application. No further notice shall be required.

       Act Applies. - An ABC permit is a "license" within the meaning of G.S. 150B-2, and, except for revocation pursuant to G.S. 18B-904(e)(3) or for a confirmation pursuant to G.S. 18B-900(a)(8), a Commission action on issuance, suspension, or revocation of an ABC permit, other than a temporary permit issued under G.S. 18B-905, is a "contested case" subject to the provisions of Chapter 150B except as provided in this section.

Hearings shall be held within 100 miles, as best can be determined by the Commission, of the county seat of the county in which the licensed business or proposed business is located.

       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority of Commission.
   
   - Authority to conduct a hearing and determine whether a State retail (or wholesale) beer permit should be revoked is lodged in the Commission. J. Lampros Whsle., Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 679</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 895 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission Charged with Duty of Finding Facts.
   
   - The agency that hears the witnesses and observes their demeanor as they testify is charged with the duty of finding the facts. J. Lampros Whsle., Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 679</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 895 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty of Court.
   
   - The duty of the court is to review the evidence and determine whether the Commission had before it any material and substantial evidence sufficient to support its findings. J. Lampros Whsle., Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 679</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 895 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Prerequisites to Suspension or Revocation of Permit.
   
   - See C'est Bon, Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 140</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 448 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Revocation of Permit Requires Notice and Hearing.
   
   - Before a permit may be revoked the permittee is entitled to notice and a hearing before the Commission. J. Lampros Whsle., Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 679</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 895 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Hearing Sufficient to Meet Requirements of Due Process.
   
   - A hearing by an examiner for the Commission, of which hearing the permittee is given notice, is represented by counsel, introduces evidence, and cross-examines the adverse witnesses, all witnesses being sworn, with right to object and except to any ruling and argue the matter, is held sufficient to meet the requirements of due process of law. Sinodis v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 282</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 587 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to furnish a copy of the hearing examiner's proposed findings and recommendations
   
   without a request cannot be held violative of due process. Sinodis v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 282</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 587 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Nature of Proceedings to Suspend Beer Permit.
   
   - A proceeding to suspend a beer permit is an administrative proceeding, which does not involve any criminal liability of the holder of such permit. Boyd v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 150</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 864 (1957).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission's findings are conclusive
   
   if supported by material and substantial evidence. Freeman v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 320</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 499 (1965); J. Lampros Whsle., Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 679</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 895 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       The findings of the Commission, when made in good faith and supported by evidence, are final. J. Lampros Whsle., Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 679</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 895 (1965); C'est Bon, Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 140</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 448 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       After a hearing to determine whether the permittee has violated the law or regulations, the findings of the Commission are conclusive if supported by competent, material and substantial evidence. C'est Bon, Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 140</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 448 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       And Its Decision Cannot Be Reversed by Jury Verdict.
   
   - The verdict of the jury in a criminal prosecution does not have the effect of reversing the decision of the Commission. Freeman v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 320</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 499 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings Held to Support Judgment Suspending Permit.
   
   - Findings of fact, supported by evidence, that the holders of a beer permit sold whiskey on the premises, and sold beer consumed by the purchaser on the premises after closing hours and at a time when the sale of beer was prohibited by law, supported judgment suspending the permit, notwithstanding the further finding that the holders had no knowledge of the unlawful conduct of the employees. Boyd v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 150</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 864 (1957).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings Held Insufficient to Sustain Order Suspending License.
   
   - A finding that a licensee's employee sold wine to an intoxicated person, without a finding that the employee "knowingly" made the sale to an intoxicated person, is insufficient to sustain an order suspending retail beer and wine license. Watkins v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 187 S.E.2d 500 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of Age of Person to Whom Licensee Sold Beer.
   
   - Testimony of officers that a person who had bought beer from a licensee declared he was under 18 is incompetent as hearsay, and a certified copy of a birth certificate without testimony of any person having knowledge thereof that it was the record of the purchaser of the beer is incompetent to prove the age of the purchaser, and therefore such evidence is insufficient to sustain a finding that the licensee sold beer to a minor or failed to give his licensed premises proper supervision. Thomas v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 513</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 884 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The superior court erred in setting aside an order of the Commission
   
   suspending a petitioner's retail beer permit where the evidence before the Commission was sufficient to sustain its findings (1) that on a certain date an intoxicated person was permitted to loiter on the licensed premises of the petitioner in violation of the Commission's regulations and (2) that the operator of the petitioner failed to give the premises proper supervision on the above occasion and where there was no evidence that the Commission acted arbitrarily or in excess of lawful authority in suspending the license. State Keg, Inc. v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 450</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 861 (1970).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial Review of Suspension of Permit.
   
   - Judicial review of an order of the Commission suspending a retail beer permit is governed by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba04s150B-43" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-43</a></cite>. Fay v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 227 S.E.2d 298, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 175</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 689 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Function of Court on Judicial Review.
   
   - On appeal to the court for judicial review of the Commission's decision, it is the duty of the court to review the evidence and determine whether the Commission had before it any material and substantial evidence sufficient to support its findings. C'est Bon, Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 140</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 448 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Petition for Review of Permit's Denial.
   
   - Where application for an ABC permit was initially denied by commission on Dec. 9, 1985, this denial was clearly a commission action on "issuance" of an ABC permit, and, pursuant to the provisions of this section, the ruling on the application became a "contested case" for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act on Dec. 9, 1985. Therefore, former G.S. 150A-45, which required petitions for review to be filed in Wake County, was applicable, rather than <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba04s150B-45" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-45</a></cite>, and the trial court properly dismissed petition for judicial review, which had been filed in Craven County. In re Melkonian, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 355 S.E.2d 798, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 793</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 78 (1987).

A delivery service permittee may also facilitate delivery through technology services that connect consumers and licensed retailers through the use of the Internet, mobile applications, and other similar technology.

       Training and Payment. - Prior to making any deliveries, each individual delivering alcoholic beverages pursuant to a delivery service permit shall successfully complete a course approved by the Commission related to the delivery of alcoholic beverages. Upon receipt of a proposed training program from a holder of a delivery service permit, the Commission shall have 15 business days to approve, deny, or request modifications to the proposed training program. An individual delivering alcoholic beverages pursuant to a delivery service permit shall not handle or possess funds used to purchase an alcoholic beverage that is to be delivered, but may facilitate the sales transaction in a manner that does not involve taking possession of funds.

       Limitations. - A delivery service permittee shall deliver alcoholic beverages only within the time allowed for lawful sales and consumption in the jurisdiction where the delivery is located. No delivery shall be made to any jurisdiction within the State that has not authorized the sale of the purchased alcoholic beverages. A delivery service permittee shall not deliver alcoholic beverages to the premises of another licensed retailer or more than 50 miles from the retailer's licensed premises. Only alcoholic beverages purchased for personal consumption and from a licensed retailer's existing inventory located on the retailer's premises may be delivered pursuant to a delivery service permit.

      <li id="t18Ba10s18B-1001.4ol1e">
       Scope and Construction. - A delivery service permit is not required for a common carrier lawfully transporting or shipping alcoholic beverages. Nothing in this section shall be construed as exempting the delivery of alcoholic beverages pursuant to a delivery service permit from the requirements set forth in Article 4 of Chapter 18B of the General Statutes. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a technology services company to obtain a delivery service permit if the company does not employ or contract with delivery drivers, but rather provides software or an application that connects consumers and licensed retailers for the delivery of alcoholic beverages from the licensed retailer.

       Penalties for Violations in Residence Halls. - Notwithstanding G.S. 18B-104, if a delivery service permittee commits a violation of this Chapter when delivering to a residence hall located on the premises of an institution of higher education the delivery service permittee shall be subject to a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) for the first violation, up to one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) for a second violation within three years of the first violation, and up to two thousand dollars ($2,000) for a third or subsequent violation within three years of the first violation. In any case in which there are two or more violations within three years by a delivery service permittee when delivering to a residence hall on the premises of an institution of higher education in which the Commission is entitled to suspend or revoke a permit, the Commission may accept from the permittee an offer in compromise to pay a penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000). The Commission may either accept a compromise or revoke a permit, but not both. The Commission may accept a compromise and suspend the permit in the same case.

      - Session Laws 2003-382, provides in its preamble: "Whereas, the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina has issued a preliminary injunction, in the case of Carandola v. Bason, enjoining the State of North Carolina from enforcing regulations which prohibit certain sexually explicit conduct on premises licensed by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission; and

      "Whereas, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated that entertainment such as nude or topless dancing at bars and clubs has 'a long history of spawning deleterious effects,' including 'prostitution and the criminal abuse and exploitation of young women'; and

        On a First Amendment challenge,
       </b>
       because the predominant purpose of this section is to address the secondary effects of lewd conduct and not merely to suppress erotic expression, it is content neutral and thus subject only to intermediate scrutiny rather than strict scrutiny. Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507 (4th Cir. 2002).

       <b>
        In an overbreadth challenge based on the First Amendment,
       </b>
       plaintiffs were likely to prevail at trial because G.S. 18B-1005(a)(5) would apply to much mainstream entertainment such as ballet and other kinds of dance as well as theater and movies with clear artistic merit. Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507 (4th Cir. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The words "permit" and "allow" are synonymous.
   
   Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Permit".
   
   - To permit as used in former G.S. 18A-34(a)(4) means to acquiesce with knowledge, to knowingly consent. Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Permit" has been construed to mean in effect "knowingly permit." To permit sale of alcoholic beverages to a minor connotes some opportunity for knowledge and prevention of the sale. Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge Required.
   
   - To permit the unlawful sale of liquor in his building, an owner must have knowledge of the violation and consent to it. Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       A finding that a licensee's employee sold wine to an intoxicated person, without a finding that the employee "knowingly" made the sale to an intoxicated person, is insufficient to sustain an order suspending retail beer and wine license. Watkins v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 187 S.E.2d 500 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Knowledge".
   
   - "Knowledge" means an impression of the mind, the state of being aware; and this may be acquired in numerous ways and from many sources. It is usually obtained from a variety of facts and circumstances. Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally speaking, when it is said that a person has knowledge of a given condition, it is meant that his relation to it, his association with it, his control over it, and his direction of it are such as give him actual information concerning it. Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that two boys violated the law on petitioner's premises on a single night within a period of 35 minutes does not constitute substantial evidence that petitioner knowingly permitted the consumption of alcoholic liquors on his premises. Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge may be implied from the circumstances.
   
   Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Proprietor Responsible Even If One Carries His Own Beverage.
   
   - The proprietor is responsible if he knowingly permits another to drink on his premises, even if he carried his own beverage. Campbell v. North Carolina State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 224</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 197 (1964), overruled on other grounds, National Food Stores v. Board of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 624</cite>, 151 S.E.2d 582 (1966); D &amp; W, Inc. v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 577</cite>, 151 S.E.2d 241 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable Effort at Enforcement.
   
   - All the evidence adduced at the hearing and considered by the Commission tended to show that the licensee had been making a reasonable effort in good faith to enforce the provisions of this section where licensee's employees were ejecting troublemakers from his premises, thus indicating petitioner's disapproval of the disorderly conduct in which the participants were engaged. Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to observe all activities on a busy parking lot
   
   for a period of 35 minutes is not a failure, within the meaning of the law, to give the licensed premises proper supervision. Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Arranging Not to See Violations.
   
   - The holder of a license for the sale of wine and beer who is aware of violations on his premises but who arranges never to see them cannot be said to be ignorant of their existence. He must take steps to avoid violations or suffer the penalties prescribed. Underwood v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 623</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 1 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of Section Does Not Constitute Deceptive Trade Practice.
   
   - Trial court properly dismissed claim of injured restaurant patrons who contended that the restaurant's service of 58 beers to four persons over five hours and the restaurant's subsequent failure to stop the patrons from leaving in their car constituted an unfair or deceptive act under the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, G.S. 75-1.1. Violations of G.S. 18B-305(a), 18B-1003, 18B-1005 or 4 N.C. Admin. Code
   <span class="s2">

   2S did not consititute a per se violation of the UDTPA. Noble v. Hooters of Greenville, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 163, 681 S.E.2d 448 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 806</cite>, LEXIS 322 (2010).

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Sufficient to Find Improper Entertainment.
   
   - There was ample, competent, material and substantial evidence to support the factual finding that petitioner did permit improper entertainment, conduct and practices upon the licensed premises by allowing dancing where the dancing girl exposed her pubic area to customers. Fay v. State Bd. of Alcoholic Control, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 227 S.E.2d 298, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 175</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 689 (1976).

        Statute Not Unconstitutionally Vague on Its Face.
       </b>
       - G.S. 18B-1005.1(a)(2) is not unconstitutionally vague on its face because the term "simulate" is sufficiently precise to notify persons of ordinary intelligence of the conduct prohibited by the statute and to prevent the risk of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement; under G.S. 18B-1005.1(a)(2), an act constitutes simulated sexual intercourse only if it creates a realistic impression of an actual sexual act. Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Fox, 470 F.3d 1074 (4th Cir. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       G.S. 18B-1005.1(a)(3) is not unconstitutionally vague on its face because the word "fondle" was sufficiently clear to prevent the risk of arbitrary enforcement and to put persons of ordinary intelligence on notice that G.S. 18B-1005.1(a)(3) was aimed at preventing overt sexual contact. Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Fox, 470 F.3d 1074 (4th Cir. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        In an overbreadth challenge based on the First Amendment,
       </b>
       plaintiffs were likely to prevail at trial because G.S. 18B-1005(a)(5) would apply to much mainstream entertainment such as ballet and other kinds of dance as well as theater and movies with clear artistic merit. Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507 (4th Cir. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Law restricting certain erotic dancing in establishments that had State liquor licenses was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face because it was too burdensome on the expressive elements of erotic dancing since it prohibited erotic movements and gestures regardless of whether a dancer was nude, and it burdened a substantial amount of mainstream musical, theatrical, and dance activity. Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Fox, 396 F. Supp. 2d 630 (M.D.N.C. 2005), aff'd in part, 470 F.3d 1074, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 30838 (4th Cir. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       G.S. 18B-1005.1(a)(1), (2), and (3) are not facially overbroad because: (1) the statute does not have as its predominant purpose an intent to suppress free expression; (2) under the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission's interpretation of the statute, G.S. 18B-1005.1 has no prohibitory effect on non-erotic dance and does not apply to other mainstream entertainment; (3) G.S. 18B-1005.1 is readily susceptible to the Commission's construction; (4) G.S. 18B-1005.1(c)'s exception shelters most protected activity; and (5) G.S. 18B-1005.1 does not reach a substantial number of impermissible applications.

     <p>
      "(4) Where the property is subject to a lease at the time of acquisition, the lease provides for or is modified contemporaneously to provide for (i) a dispute resolution process, including the use of a committee, to resolve any disagreement between lessor and lessee, (ii) a process for accountability by the parties and recourse for the failure of the parties to perform any obligations or requirements included in the lease, and (iii) a prohibition against modification to co-located facilities that would adversely and materially impact race safety, operations, and costs, provided that the co-located facilities are football facilities.

       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 2017-87, s. 19(a), (b), provides: "(a) Except as otherwise provided, the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Commission shall adopt temporary rules to implement the provisions of this act. Temporary rules adopted in accordance with this section shall remain in effect until permanent rules that replace the temporary rules become effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) Any rule or policy adopted by the ABC Commission that does not comply with the provisions of this act shall be null, void, and without effect."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2019-18 provides in its preamble: "Whereas, the General Assembly reaffirms its support of the Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system for the distribution of malt beverages and finds that the Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system does all of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Promotes consumer choice and product variety by providing a platform that enables new malt beverage products to come to market that might not otherwise be available to the consumer. These laws encourage wholesalers to make investments in their businesses necessary to expand distribution of new products and to allow large and small breweries alike an opportunity to enter the market through independent distribution. Wholesaler investments include adding resources such as warehouses, personnel, vehicles, equipment, merchandise, and marketing. Consumers have access to an exceedingly wide array of malt beverage products, unlike other industries that foster closed distribution networks and vertical integration.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Promotes the growth of the craft beer industry by providing suppliers with access to markets outside of the brewery. Brewers that use wholesalers are able to instantly access and utilize a wholesaler's established infrastructure in markets they may not otherwise be able to enter. Smaller breweries further benefit because wholesalers are able to act independently to carry all brands, from large and small suppliers. The goal of these laws is to allow brewers of all sizes to fairly compete in the marketplace and to access retailers of all sizes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Helps ensure that the industry, as a whole, complies with the alcohol laws of this State. A wholesaler must remain independent and free from unfair conduct to promote responsible sales and marketing practices. Wholesaler independence also promotes and maintains fair dealing among industry participants. Ultimately, these measures protect consumers and the public from abuses that might occur absent the three-tier system.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Promotes a vibrant marketplace that carefully balances fair competition with health and public safety concerns. The Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system ensure that all three tiers operate independently and on a level playing field so that no one participant or sector of the industry becomes too dominant over the others. These laws allow for fair checks and balances in the beer industry. Wholesaler independence further creates a transparent and accountable distribution system that assists in identifying improper marketing practices and potentially unsafe products when issues arise and provides brewers that engage a wholesaler with an established means to access new markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Prevents vertical integration of the manufacturing, distribution, and retail tiers. This still occurs in other countries today where adverse health and public safety effects are observed. The historical three-tier system model incorporated a deliberate regulatory structure that prevents monopolization. However, as the number of beer industry participants has grown substantially, it is necessary to make important adjustments to the three-tier system to promote the overall success of the beer manufacturing industry in North Carolina by recognizing the different stages of brewery development.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) Assists in collecting excise taxes, particularly from nonresident suppliers. While self-distributing resident breweries are required to remit excise taxes directly to the Department of Revenue, wholesalers collect and remit the excise tax on malt beverages on behalf of resident and nonresident suppliers to the Department of Revenue, totaling approximately $140 million in excise taxes each year to the State.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(7) Promotes local regulatory control, temperance, and moderate consumption of malt beverages. The three-tier system in particular incorporates features to promote healthy competition in the marketplace while minimizing overly-aggressive marketing practices, such as limits on quantity discounts, requirements of nondiscriminatory treatment among wholesalers and retailers, and limits on advertising and promotional materials. The three-tier system also provides clear chain of custody for products in distribution, which enables law enforcement to easily track products in the marketplace when issues arise.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(8) Provides a vital platform that promotes product safety for consumers. Malt beverage distributors invest heavily in infrastructure, such as modern warehouses and vehicles, that maintain product integrity during distribution. There are also strict record-keeping requirements, which enable wholesalers to readily track malt beverage products sold in the market for prompt return in the event of a product recall.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(9)
   Encourages wholesalers, under the Beer Franchise Law, to invest capital and labor for suppliers of all sizes, large and small, to expand into new markets with new products. Unfair or arbitrary termination is prohibited, but suppliers who are subject to the Beer Franchise Law are still afforded the ability to terminate a distribution agreement for good cause. The Beer Franchise Law inhibits forced consolidation among wholesalers. The three-tier system also affords small retailers the same market access opportunities to the same wide selection of brands that other large-scale retailers have, and on equal terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly also reaffirms its support of the craft beer industry and makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The current small-brewery provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite> of the General Statutes were intended to foster the growth of small craft breweries while simultaneously protecting wholesalers from the risk of economic uncertainty. Since the adoption of those provisions, however, the craft beer industry has seen exponential growth. The craft beer industry now provides a significant source of high-quality manufacturing and service employment and wages and generates significant tax revenue for the State. In addition, the growth of the craft beer industry has resulted in significant positive secondary impacts on the economy through increased business to a myriad of suppliers to the craft breweries, resulting in even greater employment and tax revenue for the State's citizens.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) It is in the best interest of the State to continue supporting the entrepreneurial spirit and economic growth driven by the craft beer industry. Yet it remains vital to preserve the integrity of the State's three-tier system. Today, mid-sized independent breweries possess only a fraction of the malt beverage market in light of increased consolidation and globalization of large suppliers. Consequently, the growth of these mid-sized independent breweries promotes economic development, employment and wages, and significant tax revenue without the same risks of harm that the three-tier system is designed to minimize.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) In view of these new market realities, the existing small brewery provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite> of the General Statutes warrant revision. Specifically, recognition for a new category of breweries, Mid-Sized Independent Breweries, is needed to reflect the market's evolution, foster the continued growth of the craft beer industry, promote consumer choice, ensure access to market, and promote stable and healthy competition in the malt beverage industry in this State. The following legislative enactments are expressly intended to further these purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that regulation of the malt beverage industry and the objectives sought to be achieved by this act fall squarely within the authority granted to the State by the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution and the inherent police powers of this State; Now, therefore,"

      Session Laws 2019-18 provides in its preamble: "Whereas, the General Assembly reaffirms its support of the Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system for the distribution of malt beverages and finds that the Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system does all of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Promotes consumer choice and product variety by providing a platform that enables new malt beverage products to come to market that might not otherwise be available to the consumer. These laws encourage wholesalers to make investments in their businesses necessary to expand distribution of new products and to allow large and small breweries alike an opportunity to enter the market through independent distribution. Wholesaler investments include adding resources such as warehouses, personnel, vehicles, equipment, merchandise, and marketing. Consumers have access to an exceedingly wide array of malt beverage products, unlike other industries that foster closed distribution networks and vertical integration.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Promotes the growth of the craft beer industry by providing suppliers with access to markets outside of the brewery. Brewers that use wholesalers are able to instantly access and utilize a wholesaler's established infrastructure in markets they may not otherwise be able to enter. Smaller breweries further benefit because wholesalers are able to act independently to carry all brands, from large and small suppliers. The goal of these laws is to allow brewers of all sizes to fairly compete in the marketplace and to access retailers of all sizes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Helps ensure that the industry, as a whole, complies with the alcohol laws of this State. A wholesaler must remain independent and free from unfair conduct to promote responsible sales and marketing practices. Wholesaler independence also promotes and maintains fair dealing among industry participants. Ultimately, these measures protect consumers and the public from abuses that might occur absent the three-tier system.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Promotes a vibrant marketplace that carefully balances fair competition with health and public safety concerns. The Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system ensure that all three tiers operate independently and on a level playing field so that no one participant or sector of the industry becomes too dominant over the others. These laws allow for fair checks and balances in the beer industry. Wholesaler independence further creates a transparent and accountable distribution system that assists in identifying improper marketing practices and potentially unsafe products when issues arise and provides brewers that engage a wholesaler with an established means to access new markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Prevents vertical integration of the manufacturing, distribution, and retail tiers. This still occurs in other countries today where adverse health and public safety effects are observed. The historical three-tier system model incorporated a deliberate regulatory structure that prevents monopolization. However, as the number of beer industry participants has grown substantially, it is necessary to make important adjustments to the three-tier system to promote the overall success of the beer manufacturing industry in North Carolina by recognizing the different stages of brewery development.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) Assists in collecting excise taxes, particularly from nonresident suppliers. While self-distributing resident breweries are required to remit excise taxes directly to the Department of Revenue, wholesalers collect and remit the excise tax on malt beverages on behalf of resident and nonresident suppliers to the Department of Revenue, totaling approximately $140 million in excise taxes each year to the State.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(7) Promotes local regulatory control, temperance, and moderate consumption of malt beverages. The three-tier system in particular incorporates features to promote healthy competition in the marketplace while minimizing overly-aggressive marketing practices, such as limits on quantity discounts, requirements of nondiscriminatory treatment among wholesalers and retailers, and limits on advertising and promotional materials. The three-tier system also provides clear chain of custody for products in distribution, which enables law enforcement to easily track products in the marketplace when issues arise.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(8) Provides a vital platform that promotes product safety for consumers. Malt beverage distributors invest heavily in infrastructure, such as modern warehouses and vehicles, that maintain product integrity during distribution. There are also strict record-keeping requirements, which enable wholesalers to readily track malt beverage products sold in the market for prompt return in the event of a product recall.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(9)
   Encourages wholesalers, under the Beer Franchise Law, to invest capital and labor for suppliers of all sizes, large and small, to expand into new markets with new products. Unfair or arbitrary termination is prohibited, but suppliers who are subject to the Beer Franchise Law are still afforded the ability to terminate a distribution agreement for good cause. The Beer Franchise Law inhibits forced consolidation among wholesalers. The three-tier system also affords small retailers the same market access opportunities to the same wide selection of brands that other large-scale retailers have, and on equal terms.

      "Whereas, the General Assembly also reaffirms its support of the craft beer industry and makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The current small-brewery provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite> of the General Statutes were intended to foster the growth of small craft breweries while simultaneously protecting wholesalers from the risk of economic uncertainty. Since the adoption of those provisions, however, the craft beer industry has seen exponential growth. The craft beer industry now provides a significant source of high-quality manufacturing and service employment and wages and generates significant tax revenue for the State. In addition, the growth of the craft beer industry has resulted in significant positive secondary impacts on the economy through increased business to a myriad of suppliers to the craft breweries, resulting in even greater employment and tax revenue for the State's citizens.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) It is in the best interest of the State to continue supporting the entrepreneurial spirit and economic growth driven by the craft beer industry. Yet it remains vital to preserve the integrity of the State's three-tier system. Today, mid-sized independent breweries possess only a fraction of the malt beverage market in light of increased consolidation and globalization of large suppliers. Consequently, the growth of these mid-sized independent breweries promotes economic development, employment and wages, and significant tax revenue without the same risks of harm that the three-tier system is designed to minimize.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) In view of these new market realities, the existing small brewery provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite> of the General Statutes warrant revision. Specifically, recognition for a new category of breweries, Mid-Sized Independent Breweries, is needed to reflect the market's evolution, foster the continued growth of the craft beer industry, promote consumer choice, ensure access to market, and promote stable and healthy competition in the malt beverage industry in this State. The following legislative enactments are expressly intended to further these purposes.
     </p>

       Plaintiff wholesale distributing company, which was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring a beer and wine wholesale business, and entered an agreement with a franchisee of defendant for the purchase by plaintiff of franchisee's wine and beer wholesale business, conditioned upon defendant's approval of transfer of the franchise, was a "wholesaler" under subsection (a) of this section, and was entitled to the judicial protection of G.S. 18B-1207(a).

       The North Carolina Wine Distribution Agreement Act refers to the qualifications of the "wholesaler to be substituted" not for the purpose of creating any rights in favor of a prospective transferee, but for the purpose of conditioning a winery's right to withhold its consent to a transfer of business by an existing distributor; distributor, not plaintiff, who was contracting with distributor to buy distributorship, was the party to seek defendant winery's consent, and then pursue its remedies under the Act if consent were unreasonably withheld.

       Under this section, when there was a transfer of the wholesaler's business to a nonfamily member who did not meet the material and reasonable qualifications and standards required of the winery's wholesalers, the winery could withhold or delay its consent. The effect of the winery's refusal to consent was that the winery does not have to deal with the new wholesaler. Thus, in such a situation, the winery has a right of prior consent. Empire Distribs. of N.C. Inc. v. Schieffelin & Co., 679 F. Supp. 541 (W.D.N.C. 1987).

      History

      <b>
       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 2019-18 provides in its preamble: "Whereas, the General Assembly reaffirms its support of the Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system for the distribution of malt beverages and finds that the Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system does all of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Promotes consumer choice and product variety by providing a platform that enables new malt beverage products to come to market that might not otherwise be available to the consumer. These laws encourage wholesalers to make investments in their businesses necessary to expand distribution of new products and to allow large and small breweries alike an opportunity to enter the market through independent distribution. Wholesaler investments include adding resources such as warehouses, personnel, vehicles, equipment, merchandise, and marketing. Consumers have access to an exceedingly wide array of malt beverage products, unlike other industries that foster closed distribution networks and vertical integration.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Promotes the growth of the craft beer industry by providing suppliers with access to markets outside of the brewery. Brewers that use wholesalers are able to instantly access and utilize a wholesaler's established infrastructure in markets they may not otherwise be able to enter. Smaller breweries further benefit because wholesalers are able to act independently to carry all brands, from large and small suppliers. The goal of these laws is to allow brewers of all sizes to fairly compete in the marketplace and to access retailers of all sizes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Helps ensure that the industry, as a whole, complies with the alcohol laws of this State. A wholesaler must remain independent and free from unfair conduct to promote responsible sales and marketing practices. Wholesaler independence also promotes and maintains fair dealing among industry participants. Ultimately, these measures protect consumers and the public from abuses that might occur absent the three-tier system.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Promotes a vibrant marketplace that carefully balances fair competition with health and public safety concerns. The Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system ensure that all three tiers operate independently and on a level playing field so that no one participant or sector of the industry becomes too dominant over the others. These laws allow for fair checks and balances in the beer industry. Wholesaler independence further creates a transparent and accountable distribution system that assists in identifying improper marketing practices and potentially unsafe products when issues arise and provides brewers that engage a wholesaler with an established means to access new markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Prevents vertical integration of the manufacturing, distribution, and retail tiers. This still occurs in other countries today where adverse health and public safety effects are observed. The historical three-tier system model incorporated a deliberate regulatory structure that prevents monopolization. However, as the number of beer industry participants has grown substantially, it is necessary to make important adjustments to the three-tier system to promote the overall success of the beer manufacturing industry in North Carolina by recognizing the different stages of brewery development.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) Assists in collecting excise taxes, particularly from nonresident suppliers. While self-distributing resident breweries are required to remit excise taxes directly to the Department of Revenue, wholesalers collect and remit the excise tax on malt beverages on behalf of resident and nonresident suppliers to the Department of Revenue, totaling approximately $140 million in excise taxes each year to the State.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(7) Promotes local regulatory control, temperance, and moderate consumption of malt beverages. The three-tier system in particular incorporates features to promote healthy competition in the marketplace while minimizing overly-aggressive marketing practices, such as limits on quantity discounts, requirements of nondiscriminatory treatment among wholesalers and retailers, and limits on advertising and promotional materials. The three-tier system also provides clear chain of custody for products in distribution, which enables law enforcement to easily track products in the marketplace when issues arise.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(8) Provides a vital platform that promotes product safety for consumers. Malt beverage distributors invest heavily in infrastructure, such as modern warehouses and vehicles, that maintain product integrity during distribution. There are also strict record-keeping requirements, which enable wholesalers to readily track malt beverage products sold in the market for prompt return in the event of a product recall.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(9)
   Encourages wholesalers, under the Beer Franchise Law, to invest capital and labor for suppliers of all sizes, large and small, to expand into new markets with new products. Unfair or arbitrary termination is prohibited, but suppliers who are subject to the Beer Franchise Law are still afforded the ability to terminate a distribution agreement for good cause. The Beer Franchise Law inhibits forced consolidation among wholesalers. The three-tier system also affords small retailers the same market access opportunities to the same wide selection of brands that other large-scale retailers have, and on equal terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly also reaffirms its support of the craft beer industry and makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The current small-brewery provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite> of the General Statutes were intended to foster the growth of small craft breweries while simultaneously protecting wholesalers from the risk of economic uncertainty. Since the adoption of those provisions, however, the craft beer industry has seen exponential growth. The craft beer industry now provides a significant source of high-quality manufacturing and service employment and wages and generates significant tax revenue for the State. In addition, the growth of the craft beer industry has resulted in significant positive secondary impacts on the economy through increased business to a myriad of suppliers to the craft breweries, resulting in even greater employment and tax revenue for the State's citizens.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) It is in the best interest of the State to continue supporting the entrepreneurial spirit and economic growth driven by the craft beer industry. Yet it remains vital to preserve the integrity of the State's three-tier system. Today, mid-sized independent breweries possess only a fraction of the malt beverage market in light of increased consolidation and globalization of large suppliers. Consequently, the growth of these mid-sized independent breweries promotes economic development, employment and wages, and significant tax revenue without the same risks of harm that the three-tier system is designed to minimize.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) In view of these new market realities, the existing small brewery provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite> of the General Statutes warrant revision. Specifically, recognition for a new category of breweries, Mid-Sized Independent Breweries, is needed to reflect the market's evolution, foster the continued growth of the craft beer industry, promote consumer choice, ensure access to market, and promote stable and healthy competition in the malt beverage industry in this State. The following legislative enactments are expressly intended to further these purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that regulation of the malt beverage industry and the objectives sought to be achieved by this act fall squarely within the authority granted to the State by the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution and the inherent police powers of this State; Now, therefore,"

       Filing. - It is unlawful for a supplier to provide malt beverages to a wholesaler unless the Commission has received notification from the supplier designating the brands of the supplier which the wholesaler is authorized to sell and the territory in which such sales may take place. If the supplier sells several brands, the agreement need not apply to all brands. A franchise agreement applies to all supplier products under the same brand name, and different categories of products manufactured under a common identifying trade name are considered to be the same brand. No supplier may provide by a distribution agreement for the distribution of a brand to more than one wholesaler for the same territory. A wholesaler shall not distribute any brand of malt beverage to a retailer whose premises are located outside the territory specified in the wholesaler's distribution agreement for that brand. A wholesaler may, however, with the approval of the Commission distribute malt beverages outside its designated territory during periods of temporary service interruption when requested to do so by the supplier and the wholesaler whose service is interrupted.

      <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1303ol1b">
       No Discrimination. - A wholesaler shall service all retail permit holders within the wholesaler's designated territory without discrimination and shall make a good faith effort to make available to each retail permit holder in the territory each brand of malt beverage which the wholesaler has been authorized to distribute in that area. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to retail permit holder private label brands, which, at the retail permit holder's direction, may be sold either exclusively to the retailer that owns the brand name or to all retail permit holders within each territory without discrimination. For purposes of this subsection, the term "retail permit holder private label brand" means a malt beverage product that is labeled with a brand name owned by a retailer.

      <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1305ol1a">
       Meaning of Good Cause. - Good cause for altering or terminating a franchise agreement, or failing to renew or causing a wholesaler to resign from such an agreement, exists when the wholesaler fails to comply with provisions of the agreement which are reasonable, material, not unconscionable, and which are not discriminatory when compared with the provisions imposed, by their terms or in the manner of enforcement, on other similarly situated wholesaler by the supplier. The meaning of good cause set out in this section may not be modified or superseded by provisions in a written franchise agreement prepared by a supplier if those provisions purport to define good cause in a manner different than specified in this section. In any dispute over alteration, termination, failure to renew or causing a wholesaler to resign from a franchise agreement, the burden is on the supplier to establish that good cause exists for the action.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1305ol1-a1">
       Termination by a Small Brewery. - A brewery's authorization to distribute its own malt beverage products pursuant to G.S. 18B-1104(a)(8) shall revert back to the brewery, in the absence of good cause, following the fifth business day after confirmed receipt of written notice of such reversion by the brewery to the wholesaler. The brewery shall pay the wholesaler fair market value for the distribution rights for the affected brand. For purposes of this subsection, "fair market value" means the highest dollar amount at which a seller would be willing to sell and a buyer willing to buy at the time the self-distribution rights revert back to the brewery, after each party has been provided all information relevant to the transaction. This subsection only applies to a brewery that sells to consumers at the brewery, to wholesalers, to retailers, and to exporters fewer than 25,000 barrels of malt beverages produced by it per year. Malt beverages manufactured by a supplier permittee that owns five percent (5%) or more of a brewery permittee shall be included in determining whether the brewery permittee complies with the barrelage limitations set forth in this subdivision. For purposes of this subsection, the term "barrel" is as defined in G.S. 18B-1104.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1305ol1b">
       Notice of Cause. - At least 90 days before altering, terminating or failing to renew a franchise agreement for good cause, the supplier must give the wholesaler written notice of the intended action and the specific reasons for it. If the cause for the alteration, termination or failure to renew is subject to correction by the wholesaler, and the wholesaler makes such correction within 45 days of receipt of the notice, the notice shall be void.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1305ol1c">
       Termination for Cause without Advance Notice. - A supplier may terminate or fail to renew a franchise agreement for any of the following reasons, and the termination shall be complete upon receipt by the wholesaler of a written notice of the termination and the reason:
       <ol>
        <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1305ol1c1">
         Insolvency of the wholesaler, the dissolution or liquidation of the wholesaler, or the filing of any petition by or against the wholesaler under any bankruptcy or receivership law which materially affects the wholesaler's ability to remain in business.

         Conviction of the wholesaler, or of a partner or individual who owns ten percent (10%) or more of the partnership or stock of the wholesaler, of a felony which might reasonably be expected to adversely affect the goodwill or interest of the wholesaler or supplier. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply, however, if the wholesaler or its existing partners or stockholders shall have the right to purchase the interest of the offending partner or stockholder, and such purchase is completed within 30 days of the conviction.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1305ol1c4">
         Fraudulent conduct by the wholesaler in its dealings with the supplier or its products.

         Failure of the wholesaler to pay for the supplier's products according to the established terms of the supplier.

       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 2017-87, s. 19(a), (b), provides: "(a) Except as otherwise provided, the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Commission shall adopt temporary rules to implement the provisions of this act. Temporary rules adopted in accordance with this section shall remain in effect until permanent rules that replace the temporary rules become effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) Any rule or policy adopted by the ABC Commission that does not comply with the provisions of this act shall be null, void, and without effect."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2019-18 provides in its preamble: "Whereas, the General Assembly reaffirms its support of the Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system for the distribution of malt beverages and finds that the Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system does all of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Promotes consumer choice and product variety by providing a platform that enables new malt beverage products to come to market that might not otherwise be available to the consumer. These laws encourage wholesalers to make investments in their businesses necessary to expand distribution of new products and to allow large and small breweries alike an opportunity to enter the market through independent distribution. Wholesaler investments include adding resources such as warehouses, personnel, vehicles, equipment, merchandise, and marketing. Consumers have access to an exceedingly wide array of malt beverage products, unlike other industries that foster closed distribution networks and vertical integration.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Promotes the growth of the craft beer industry by providing suppliers with access to markets outside of the brewery. Brewers that use wholesalers are able to instantly access and utilize a wholesaler's established infrastructure in markets they may not otherwise be able to enter. Smaller breweries further benefit because wholesalers are able to act independently to carry all brands, from large and small suppliers. The goal of these laws is to allow brewers of all sizes to fairly compete in the marketplace and to access retailers of all sizes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Helps ensure that the industry, as a whole, complies with the alcohol laws of this State. A wholesaler must remain independent and free from unfair conduct to promote responsible sales and marketing practices. Wholesaler independence also promotes and maintains fair dealing among industry participants. Ultimately, these measures protect consumers and the public from abuses that might occur absent the three-tier system.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Promotes a vibrant marketplace that carefully balances fair competition with health and public safety concerns. The Beer Franchise Law and the three-tier system ensure that all three tiers operate independently and on a level playing field so that no one participant or sector of the industry becomes too dominant over the others. These laws allow for fair checks and balances in the beer industry. Wholesaler independence further creates a transparent and accountable distribution system that assists in identifying improper marketing practices and potentially unsafe products when issues arise and provides brewers that engage a wholesaler with an established means to access new markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Prevents vertical integration of the manufacturing, distribution, and retail tiers. This still occurs in other countries today where adverse health and public safety effects are observed. The historical three-tier system model incorporated a deliberate regulatory structure that prevents monopolization. However, as the number of beer industry participants has grown substantially, it is necessary to make important adjustments to the three-tier system to promote the overall success of the beer manufacturing industry in North Carolina by recognizing the different stages of brewery development.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) Assists in collecting excise taxes, particularly from nonresident suppliers. While self-distributing resident breweries are required to remit excise taxes directly to the Department of Revenue, wholesalers collect and remit the excise tax on malt beverages on behalf of resident and nonresident suppliers to the Department of Revenue, totaling approximately $140 million in excise taxes each year to the State.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(7) Promotes local regulatory control, temperance, and moderate consumption of malt beverages. The three-tier system in particular incorporates features to promote healthy competition in the marketplace while minimizing overly-aggressive marketing practices, such as limits on quantity discounts, requirements of nondiscriminatory treatment among wholesalers and retailers, and limits on advertising and promotional materials. The three-tier system also provides clear chain of custody for products in distribution, which enables law enforcement to easily track products in the marketplace when issues arise.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(8) Provides a vital platform that promotes product safety for consumers. Malt beverage distributors invest heavily in infrastructure, such as modern warehouses and vehicles, that maintain product integrity during distribution. There are also strict record-keeping requirements, which enable wholesalers to readily track malt beverage products sold in the market for prompt return in the event of a product recall.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(9)
   Encourages wholesalers, under the Beer Franchise Law, to invest capital and labor for suppliers of all sizes, large and small, to expand into new markets with new products. Unfair or arbitrary termination is prohibited, but suppliers who are subject to the Beer Franchise Law are still afforded the ability to terminate a distribution agreement for good cause. The Beer Franchise Law inhibits forced consolidation among wholesalers. The three-tier system also affords small retailers the same market access opportunities to the same wide selection of brands that other large-scale retailers have, and on equal terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly also reaffirms its support of the craft beer industry and makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The current small-brewery provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite> of the General Statutes were intended to foster the growth of small craft breweries while simultaneously protecting wholesalers from the risk of economic uncertainty. Since the adoption of those provisions, however, the craft beer industry has seen exponential growth. The craft beer industry now provides a significant source of high-quality manufacturing and service employment and wages and generates significant tax revenue for the State. In addition, the growth of the craft beer industry has resulted in significant positive secondary impacts on the economy through increased business to a myriad of suppliers to the craft breweries, resulting in even greater employment and tax revenue for the State's citizens.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) It is in the best interest of the State to continue supporting the entrepreneurial spirit and economic growth driven by the craft beer industry. Yet it remains vital to preserve the integrity of the State's three-tier system. Today, mid-sized independent breweries possess only a fraction of the malt beverage market in light of increased consolidation and globalization of large suppliers. Consequently, the growth of these mid-sized independent breweries promotes economic development, employment and wages, and significant tax revenue without the same risks of harm that the three-tier system is designed to minimize.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) In view of these new market realities, the existing small brewery provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 18B</a></cite> of the General Statutes warrant revision. Specifically, recognition for a new category of breweries, Mid-Sized Independent Breweries, is needed to reflect the market's evolution, foster the continued growth of the craft beer industry, promote consumer choice, ensure access to market, and promote stable and healthy competition in the malt beverage industry in this State. The following legislative enactments are expressly intended to further these purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that regulation of the malt beverage industry and the objectives sought to be achieved by this act fall squarely within the authority granted to the State by the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution and the inherent police powers of this State; Now, therefore,"
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2019-18, s. 6, is a severability clause.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2019-18, s. 7, provides: "This act does not apply to any exemption order or amendment thereto entered by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission prior to the effective date of this act [May 30, 2019], or to any such exemption order or amendment that is renewed or reissued by the Commission after the effective date of this act [May 30, 2019]."

       Right of Transfer to Designated Family Member. - An individual's interest in a wholesaler business, including the rights under the franchise agreement with the supplier, may be transferred or assigned to a designated family member. The transfer or assignment shall not be effective until written notice is given to the supplier, but the supplier's consent is not required for the transfer or assignment. "Designated family member" means the wholesaler's spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother, sister, niece, or nephew. With respect to an incapacitated individual having an ownership interest in a wholesaler, the term "designated family member" also means the person appointed by the court as the conservator of such individual's property. The term also includes the appointed and qualified personal representative and the testamentary trustee of a deceased wholesaler.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1307ol1b">
       Approval of Certain Transfers and Mergers. - Upon notice to and approval by the supplier, an individual owning an interest in a wholesaler may sell, assign or transfer that interest, including the wholesaler's rights under its franchise agreement with the supplier, to any qualified person. Likewise, a wholesaler may merge with another wholesaler in the State, transferring to the new wholesaler entity the merging wholesaler's existing franchise rights. Within 30 days of receipt of notice of the intended sale, assignment, transfer, or merger, the supplier shall request any additional relevant, material information reasonably necessary for deciding whether to approve the transaction. The supplier shall have 30 days from receipt of that information to object to the sale, assignment, transfer, or merger. The supplier may object only if the proposed transferee, or the wholesalership resulting from the merger, fails to meet qualifications and standards that are nondiscriminatory, material, reasonable and consistently applied to North Carolina wholesalers by the supplier. The burden shall be upon the supplier to prove that the proposed transferee or merged wholesaler is not qualified. In determining whether the proposed transferee or merged wholesaler is a qualified person, the supplier shall consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:
       <ol>
        <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1307ol1b1">
         Whether the proposed transferee has the financial capacity to purchase the wholesaler or the specified interest upon terms that will not jeopardize the future operation of the business, or whether the new entity resulting from a merger will have such financial capacity to operate successfully, and whether under such ownership the wholesaler will be able to provide financial support necessary to the successful operation of the business, including market spending, capital expenditures, and any equity capitalization or refinancing requirements.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1307ol1b2">
         Whether the proposed transferee, or the new entity resulting from a merger, has the proven business experience to hire and maintain a management team to successfully operate the business.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1307ol1b3">
         If the proposed transferee does not have experience in the beer business, whether the transferee has other experience to enable it to operate a distributorship successfully and whether the transferee is willing to participate in training provided by the supplier.
        </li>
        <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1307ol1b4">
         Whether the proposed transferee, or a party to the merger, already is a wholesaler for the supplier in a different territory and, if so, whether sufficient time and attention can be devoted to an additional market area.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ba13s18B-1307ol1c">
       Damages. - A supplier who disapproves or prevents a proposed assignment or change of ownership or merger in violation of this section shall be liable to the wholesaler who proposed to make the sale, assignment, transfer, or merger for the difference between the disapproved sale price and a subsequent actual price of a sale of the same assets completed within a reasonable period. If, however, the proposed transfer or sale was to a business associate at a bargain price, the amount of compensation shall be at least the fair market value of the interest proposed to be sold or transferred, minus the proceeds of an actual sale of the interest completed within a reasonable time.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In determining whether a proposed transferee, or the entity resulting from a merger, is a qualified person, a supplier must consider the business on its own merits and may not designate a specifically identified person as the only purchaser who will be approved. Nothing in this subsection is intended to or should be construed to authorize a supplier to match and reassign to a designee the right to purchase the ownership interest, subject to the designee purchasing the ownership interest. Provided, however, a supplier may match and reassign to a designee the right to purchase the ownership interest, subject to the designee purchasing the ownership interest at the price and on the conditions applicable to the purchase proposed by the transferee, if the total annual gross sales of the supplier's malt beverages sold by the selling wholesaler total no more than five percent (5%) of the selling wholesaler's total annual gross sales of wine and malt beverages in dollars.

     <p>
      If a dispute arises between a wholesaler and supplier under this Article, and such dispute appears likely to lead to litigation, the Commission, upon request of any party or on its own initiative, may require the parties to participate in mediation in an effort to resolve the dispute. This authority shall be in addition to the Commission's authority to issue declaratory rulings pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba01s150B-4" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-4</a></cite>.

If the parties then cannot agree upon a mediator, the Commission shall designate the mediator, and the fees shall be divided evenly by the parties. The Commission shall direct that the mediation be completed within a specified period of time. Except for injunctive relief, no lawsuit or other legal action concerning the dispute may be filed until the mediation is completed and is unsuccessful, unless necessary to avoid expiration of a statute of limitation.
