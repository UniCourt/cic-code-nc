                    have failed to make property available for such activities because of the exposure to liability from lawsuits and the prohibitive cost of insurance, if insurance can be obtained for such activities. It is also recognized that risks
                    and dangers are inherent in these activities, which risks and dangers should be assumed by those participating in the activities.
