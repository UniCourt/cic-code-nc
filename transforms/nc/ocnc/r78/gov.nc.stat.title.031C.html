        <p>
            Upon death of a married person, one half of the property to which this Chapter applies is the property of the surviving spouse and is not subject to testamentary disposition by the decedent or distribution under the laws of succession of this State. One
            half of that property is the property of the decedent and is subject to testamentary disposition or distribution under the laws of succession of this State. With respect to property to which this Chapter applies, the one half of the property
            of the decedent is not subject to the surviving spouse's right to petition for an elective share under the provisions of Article 1A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.030.html" target="_blank">Chapter 30</a></cite>,
            and is not subject to the right to elect a life estate under the provisions of Article 8 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html" target="_blank">Chapter 29</a></cite>.
