                        or the keepers of the dog that bit the victim; rather the evidence showed that it was the defendant's son and the son's girlfriend that owned the dog that bit the victim.

                        Warrant Insufficient. - Because a warrant for defendant's arrest, following his dog biting a person, did not allege each element in G.S. 67-4.3, a Class 1 misdemeanor, most specifically the monetary damages at issue, defendant could not be convicted of
                        violating G.S. 67-4.3; he could be convicted of violating G.S. 67-4.2(a), a Class 3 misdemeanor, which did not have the same element of monetary damages. State v. Burge, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite>                        220, 710 S.E.2d 446 (2011).

                        Failure to Prove Defendant Was the Owner or Keeper of the Dog. - Jury award to the victim of a dog bite was vacated as the trial court erred by not granting the defendants' motion for a directed verdict because the victim failed to establish that the
                        defendants who the victim sued were the owners or the keepers of the dog that bit the victim; rather the evidence showed that it was the defendant's son and the son's girlfriend that owned the dog that bit the victim. Lee v. Rice,
