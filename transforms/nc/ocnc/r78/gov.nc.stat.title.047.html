                    <p>
                        Taking Acknowledgment as Judicial Act. - Taking of an acknowledgment of the execution of a deed by a notary public is a judicial or quasi-judicial act by a public official for which he may not be held liable absent a showing that his act was corrupt.
                        Nelson v. Comer, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 205 S.E.2d 537 (1974).

                    <p>
                        A woman is qualified to act as a notary public in North Carolina. Preston v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 62</cite>, 110 S.E. 586 (1922).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Effect of Disqualification. - If the disqualification of either the probating or acknowledging officer appears upon the face of the record, the registration is a nullity as to subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers. Quinnerly v. Quinnerly,
                        <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 145</cite>, 19 S.E. 99 (1894).

                    <p>
                        When the incapacity of the acknowledging or probating officer is latent, i.e., does not appear upon the record, one who takes under the grantee in such instrument gets a good title, unless the party claiming the benefit of the defected acknowledgment
                        or probate is cognizant of the fact. Richmond Guano Co. v. Walston, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 667</cite>, 122 S.E. 663 (1924); County Sav. Bank v. Tolbert, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 126</cite>,

                        Registration of improperly acknowledged or defectively probated deed imports no constructive notice and the deed will be treated as if unregistered. New Home Bldg. Supply Co. v. Nations, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 681</cite>,
                        131 S.E.2d 425 (1963).

                    <p>
                        A timber deed in regular form, having a valid assignment of the timber rights by the grantee in the deed endorsed on its back, was duly registered, and the endorsement was transcribed on the records with the deed. It was held that even though the endorsement
                        was sufficient as a conveyance of the timber rights, the endorsement was not acknowledged, and therefore there was no registration of the endorsement so as to defeat the rights of the creditors of the grantee in the deed. New Home
                        Bldg. Supply Co. v. Nations, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 681</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 425 (1963).

                        A contract to sell and convey timber, in order to be enforceable against creditors and purchasers for value, must be probated and registered as provided by this Chapter. Winston v. Williams &amp; McKeithan Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 339</cite>,

                        under this subsection gives rise to a presumption that the seal or stamp was not required to be affixed by the notary. This presumption is rebuttable and applies to all instruments whenever recorded. However, a court order finding
                        the lack of a valid seal does not affect the rights of a person that (i) records an interest in the real property described in the instrument before the finding of a lack of a valid seal and (ii) would otherwise have an enforceable

                        presumably his, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. This is not rebutted by the mere fact that the notary signs his name "Geo. Theo. Sommer" and the seal has on it the name of "Theo. Sommer," when the fact of the execution
                        of the deed is adjudged to have been proved by such seal and certificate of the notary. Deans v. Pate, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 194</cite>, 19 S.E. 146 (1894).

                    <p>
                        Effect of Omission of Seal. - The failure of a justice of the peace to attach his seal to a certificate of the proof of execution of a deed and privy examination of the wife did not invalidate his action, otherwise regular. Lineberger v. Tidwell,
                        <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 506</cite>, 10 S.E. 758 (1889).

                    <p>
                        Presumption as to Seal. - When a copy of the certificate of the commissioner of affidavits concludes, "Given under my hand and seal," the presumption is that the seal was affixed to the original, though not appearing in the copy. Johnson v. Eversole Lumber
                        Co., <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 249</cite>, 60 S.E. 1129 (1908).

                        Presumption of Notarial Seal. - The acceptance of a record for registration by the register of deeds shall give rise to a presumption that, at the time the record was presented for registration, a clear and legible image of the notary's official seal
                        was affixed or embossed on the record near the notary's official signature. This presumption applies regardless of whether the image is legible or photographically reproduced in the records maintained by the register of deeds and
                        applies to all instruments filed in the records maintained by the register of deeds regardless of when the instrument was presented for registration. A register of deeds may not refuse to accept a record for registration because
                        a notarial seal does not satisfy the requirements of G.S. 10B-37. The presumption under this subsection is rebuttable and shall apply to all instruments whenever recorded. However, a court order finding the lack of a valid seal
                        shall not affect the rights of a person who (i) records an interest in the real property described in the instrument before the finding of a lack of a valid seal and (ii) would otherwise have an enforceable interest in the real

                        Elements of Adjudication. - If the certificate is not found in due form, the instrument is rejected. If the certificate is adjudged in due form, then the clerk (now the register of deeds) admits to probate, i.e., probates it, passes upon the certificate
                        as furnishing proof of execution, and adjudges as to the genuineness of the certificate, the authority of the officer, and whether the justice or officer certifying is such, and the sufficiency of proof as certified. White v. Connelly,

                        Adjudication Is Mandatory - Qualification of the Rule. - While it is held that such act of adjudication and order of registration are directory upon the clerk of the superior court (now the register of deeds) of the county wherein the land is situated,
                        it is so only where the fiat or order of registration has been properly made by the clerk (now the register of deeds) of another county upon which such power has been conferred by the statute, and in the absence of any proper fiat
                        or order for registration, the conveyance will be ineffectual against the rights of purchasers and creditors of the grantor. Champion Fibre Co. v. Cozad, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 600</cite>, 112 S.E.

                        Adjudication Is Mandatory - Where Probate Taken by Foreign Commissioner of Deeds. - The probate to a mortgage of lands situated in North Carolina, taken by the commissioner of deeds in another state, registered without the fiat or order for registration
                        by a clerk of the superior court (now the register of deeds) within the State, and clothed with authority to do so by statute, is ineffectual as against purchasers or creditors to pass title to the purchaser at the foreclosure

                        Substantial Compliance Sufficient. - A substantial compliance with this section and G.S. 47-37 is all that is necessary to be observed by the clerk of the superior court (now the register of deeds) of the county wherein the land lay, in passing upon the
                        certificate to a deed thereto made and executed in another state; and when objection to the validity of registration is made on that ground, and it appears of record on appeal that the certificate made in such other state is in
                        fact sufficient, the validity of the registration will be declared and upheld by the Supreme Court. Kleybolte &amp; Co. v. Black Mt. Timber Co., <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 635</cite>, 66 S.E. 663 (1910).

                        Use of Words "In Due Form" Not Essential to Adjudication. - The adjudication by the clerk of the superior court (now the register of deeds) that "the foregoing instrument has been duly proved, as appears from the foregoing seal and certificate," does
                        not follow the very words of the statute in that it does not adjudge that said probate is "in due form." But it is intelligible and means substantially the same thing and will be upheld without regard to mere form. Devereux v.

                        Where the acknowledgment was before an officer authorized to take it and the probate was in fact in due form, the omission of the clerk (now the register of deeds) to adjudge in just so many words that the probate was "in due form," when in substance
                        he did so adjudge, did not constitute sufficient grounds to exclude the deed. Deans v. Pate, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 194</cite>, 19 S.E. 146 (1894).

                        Registration No Evidence of Adjudication Without Signed Certificate of Clerk. - Where the acknowledgment of the grantor and his wife to a deed to lands has been properly taken and the clerk of the court (now the register of deeds) has failed or omitted
                        to sign his name to the certificate for registration, the registration of the instrument is no evidence of compliance with the provisions of this section. The curative statutes, G.S. 47-49, 47-86, 47-87, 47-88, and 47-89, have
                        no application. Woodlief v. Woodlief, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 634</cite>, 135 S.E. 612 (1926).

        Parol Evidence.
       </b> - The statutes of this State require, as the method of authentication and warrant to the register to record a deed, that a certificate complying substantially with the terms of the statute shall be attached to or endorsed
                        upon the deed, even though probate is had before the clerk of the superior court (now the register of deeds), and where no sufficient certificate was attached to or endorsed upon an instrument, it could not be shown by parol that
                        proper proof was made before the clerk. National Bank v. Hill, 226 F. 102 (E.D.N.C. 1915).

                    <p>
                        To What Clerk Must Certify. - It is only required for a valid probate that the clerk (now the register of deeds) should certify to the proof of a deed taken before him. It is only when he passes upon a probate taken before some other officer that he is
                        required to certify to the correctness of the probate and certificate. Table Rock Lumber Co. v. Branch, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 251</cite>, 73 S.E. 164 (1911).

                        Adjudication of Instrument Probated in Another State. - When a deed in trust made and executed beyond the borders of this State conveying lands herein has been there acknowledged and probated before a notary public, and (unnecessarily) the clerk of the
                        Supreme Court, in compliance with a statute there, has certified the official character of the notary and his authority as such, it is a sufficient compliance with this section and G.S. 47-37 for the clerk of the superior court
                        (now the register of deeds) of the county wherein the land lay to certify that "the foregoing and annexed certificate of (naming the clerk), a clerk of the Supreme Court, etc., duly authenticated by his official seal, is adjudged
                        to be correct, in due form and according to law, and the foregoing and annexed deed of trust is adjudged to be duly proved, etc." Kleybolte &amp; Co. v. Black Mt. Timber Co., <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 635</cite>,

                        Certificate Not Required for Registration of Grant by State. - The certificate of the clerk of the court (now the register of deeds), required as a prerequisite to the registration of instruments named therein, is not essential to the validity of the
                        registration of a grant, the great seal of the State being sufficient authority for such registration. Ray v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 472</cite>, 11 S.E. 182 (1890).

        Defective Corporate Deed of Trust Invalid Notwithstanding Adjudication.
       </b> - A corporate deed of trust was executed by the trustee, as well as the corporation, and bore a notary's certificate of proof of the trustee's execution, and a certificate as required by this section that the instrument
                        had been duly proved, "as appears from the foregoing seals and certificate, which are adjudged to be in due form and according to law," but no certificate as to the proof of execution by the corporation was attached. It was held,
                        under this section, that the certificate was invalid, and did not entitle the deed to registration. National Bank v. Hill, 226 F. 102 (E.D.N.C. 1915).

                        Ancient Document Rule. - Plaintiffs claimed the locus in quo under 7 years adverse possession under color and under 20 years adverse possession. Defendants objected to certain deeds in plaintiffs' chain of color of title on the ground that they were improperly
                        registered and did not comply with this section and G.S. 47-17. It was held that the deeds, having been on record for some 30 years, were competent under the ancient document rule to be submitted to the jury on the claim of adverse
                        possession for 20 years, and error, if any, in admitting the deeds as color of title was not prejudicial under the facts. Owens v. Blackwood Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 133</cite>, 193 S.E.

                        This act applies to the recording of documents in the land records office maintained by a recorder. It applies both to the filing of, and the searching for, documents in the recorder's office by whatever term or terms those functions and offices are known
                        locally.

                        This article results from a study the General Statutes Commission was directed to perform by S.L. 2004-161, s. 6.1. The Commission filed its report with the General Assembly on January 26, 2005, and a supplement to that report on March 8, 2005. The Uniform
                        Act's term "recorder" was replaced throughout with the term used in this State, "register of deeds."

                            "Document." A document consists of information stored on a medium, whether the medium be tangible or electronic, provided that the information is retrievable in a perceivable form. The traditional tangible medium has been paper on which information is
                            inscribed by writing, typing, printing or similar means. It is perceivable by reading it directly from the paper on which it is inscribed. An electronic medium may be one on which information is stored magnetically and from
                            which it may be retrieved and read indirectly on a computer monitor or a paper printout.

                            "Electronic." The term "electronic" refers to the use of electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic and similar technologies. It is a descriptive term meant to include all technologies involving electronic processes. The listing
                            of specific technologies is not intended to be a limiting one. For example, biometric identification technologies would be included if they affect communication and storage of information by electronic means. As electronic
                            technologies expand and include other competencies, those competencies should also be included under this definition.

                            "Electronic document." An "electronic document" is a "document" that is in an "electronic" form. Both of these terms are previously defined. However, this definition adds an additional requirement not specifically stated in the individual definitions.
                            In order to be an "electronic document" the document must be received by the recorder in an "electronic" form. The character of a document as "electronic" or "paper" will be determined at the moment it is received by the recorder.

                            "Electronic signature." The term "electronic signature" is based on the definition of that term in UETA § 2(8). However, this definition uses the word "document" instead of "record" to identify the instrument being signed. (See generally paragraph 1,
                            above, for a discussion of the reasons).

                            "Person." The definition of a "person" is the standard definition for that term used in acts adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. It includes individuals, associations of individuals, and corporate and governmental
                            entities.

                        While a document recorded in a land records office will usually contain information affecting real property, it need not necessarily be so limited. It applies to any document that is recorded in the land records office maintained by the recorder. Deeds,
                        grants of easements, and mortgages are documents subject to this act. Similarly, certificates and affidavits not directly affecting real property may be documents under this act if state law provides these documents are to be recorded
                        in the land records office.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of a document in this act is derived from the definition of the term "record" as contained in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA)
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 2(13). In the terms of that act, a document is a record that is eligible to be recorded in the land records maintained by the recorder. In selecting the defined term "document" for use throughout this act, an explicit
                        decision was made not to use "record" as a defined term. The term "record" has a different meaning in real estate recording law and practice than it has in UETA. If the term "record" were used generally in this act, it might lead
                        to confusion and misinterpretation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In UETA, the term "record" refers to information on a tangible or electronic medium as does the term "document" in this act. In this act, however, depending on syntax, the term "record" and its variations can have several meanings, all of which deal with
                        document storage and not the information itself. For example, this act deals with the
                        <i>
        recording
       </i> process through which a person can
                        <i>
        record
       </i> a document. The government officer who oversees the land
                        <i>
        records
       </i> office is the
                        <i>
        recorder
       </i> . These terms are so ingrained in the lexicon of real estate recording law and practice that it would not be productive to attempt to change them by this act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of the term "electronic" in this act has the same meaning as it has in UETA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 2(5).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though a document may have an existence in an "electronic" form prior or subsequent to being received by the recorder it might not be an "electronic document" under this act. For example, the document may have been created by an electronic process
                        or have existed in an electronic form before being converted to, and received by the recorder in, a paper form. Thus, a document prepared on a computer by means of a word processing program may have been created electronically
                        and may still exist electronically. If, however, the document is printed and submitted to the recorder on paper, the submitted document is not an electronic document. Similarly, after arriving in the recorder's office in a paper
                        form, the document may be converted to an electronic form prior to, or as part of, the recording process. The paper document does not become an electronic document because of the post-receipt conversion. (For a definition of the
                        term "paper document,"
                        <i>
        see
       </i>
                        <span class="s2">

       </span> 4(a).)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By comparison, a document received by the recorder in an electronic form, but subsequently converted to a paper form, will be considered to be an electronic document. For example, if a document is received electronically and then printed in a paper form
                        in the recorder's office prior to storage, it is, nonetheless, an electronic document. Thus, a document received by the process commonly known as a facsimile or a FAX, is an electronic document. Issues common to electronic documents,
                        such as security and integrity, also relate to a facsimile or FAX document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In many cases a document may have originally been executed in a paper form with "wet signatures" and subsequently imaged and converted into an electronic format. This act provides that, if such a converted document is received by the recorder in an electronic
                        format, it will be considered to be an electronic document and may be recorded. (
                        <i>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This act does not state or limit the type of electronic documents that may be accepted by the recorder. Nor does it state the type of electronic signatures that are permissible. Those matters are subject to the standards adopted by the state Electronic
                        Recording Commission or state agency pursuant to
                        <span class="s2">

       </span> 5.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This act applies only to documents that are received by the recorder in an electronic form and enables those documents to be recorded. The recordability of documents not received by the recorder in an electronic form continues to depend on other state
                        law.

                            Subsection (a) states the basic principle of this act - if a document would be recordable in a paper format, an electronic document with the same content and meeting the requirements of this act is also recordable. Any reference in a statute, regulation,
                            or standard to a document as being on paper or a similar tangible medium in order to be recorded is superseded by this act. Similarly any statute, regulation, or standard that specifies that a document must be in writing in
                            order to be recorded is also overruled by this act. Furthermore, since any paper-specific requirement such as the size of the paper or the color of the ink used for the document is inapplicable to an electronic document, those
                            requirements do not prohibit or limit the recording of electronic documents.

                            Subsection (b) provides that any statute, regulation, or standard requiring that a document be signed in order to be recorded is satisfied by an electronic signature attached to an electronic document. The provisions of UETA and the federal Electronic
                            Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign) provide that an electronic signature is not an impediment to the enforceability of an electronic document between the parties to the transaction. Similarly, this section
                            provides that an electronic signature is not an impediment to the recording of the document.

                            This section provides that any statute, regulation, or standard requiring that a notarization, acknowledgement, verification, witnessing, or taking of an oath be done on paper or similar tangible medium, that it be done in writing, or that it be signed,
                            is satisfied by an electronic signature that is attached to, or logically associated with, the electronic document. It permits a notary public or other authorized person to act electronically without the need to do so on paper.

                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        This subsection also provides that any stipulation of state law requiring that a document be an original document is satisfied by an electronic document meeting the requirements of this act. For example, this section acknowledges that one form of electronic
                        document is created by making an electronic duplicate of an original paper document. The duplicate is an electronic "picture" of the original document with all of its signatures and verifications. Under some existing state laws,
                        the electronic duplicate may be considered to be a copy of the original paper document and not the original itself. The laws of the state may also provide that a copy of a document may not be recorded. This act corrects that circumstance
                        and allows the electronic document containing the "picture" of the original document to be recorded. Of course, in order to be valid, the original paper document must be executed in accordance with law, including a signature and
                        verification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It also provides that any statute, regulation, or standard that requires a personal or corporate stamp, impression, or seal is satisfied by an electronic signature. These physical indicia are inapplicable to a fully electronic document. Thus, the notarial
                        stamp or impression that is required under the laws of some states is not required for an electronic notarization under this act. Nor is there a need for a corporate stamp or impression as would otherwise be required under the
                        laws of some states to verify the action of a corporate officer. Nevertheless, this act requires that the information that would otherwise be contained in the stamp, impression, or seal must be attached to, or logically associated
                        with, the document or signature in an electronic fashion.

                            A "paper document" is one that is received by the recorder in a form that is not "electronic." Despite the use of the word "paper," this document form is not limited to documents on a paper medium; the use of the word "paper" is merely a convenience.
                            It applies to any non-electronic document that the recorder is authorized to accept.

                                    or all of those functions. It merely allows each recorder to implement them when and if the recorder decides to proceed with electronic recording.

                                    electronic documents. The recorder may store those electronic documents, or the information contained in them, and create an index of the documents or information. The recorder may also transmit electronic documents
                                    and communications to the recording party or to other parties. Finally, the recorder may archive the electronic documents or the information in them as well as the index in order to preserve and protect them. This is
                                    an election to be made by the recorder that is separate from the decision to provide electronic searching, as described in paragraph (3).

                                    Paragraph (3) provides that the recorder may choose to implement electronic search and retrieval functions. Searching and retrieval functions include any process by which a title searcher obtains information from the land records system. The paragraph
                                    allows a recorder to authorize persons to access documents or their information, including index information, electronically. In so doing, the recorder may allow the accessing party to search the index and the stored
                                    documents or information electronically and to retrieve them in an electronic format. This is an election to be made by the recorder that is separate from the decision to record electronic documents, as described in
                                    paragraph (2). A recorder who operates a "Torrens" title registration system also may choose to implement the functions of accessing, searching, and retrieving documents or information in the title registration system.

                                    This act does not require that persons engaging in real estate transactions use electronic documents in order to have their documents recorded. It merely permits the recorder to accept electronic documents if they are presented electronically. Economics,
                                    availability of technology, and human nature suggest that not everyone will begin to use electronic real estate documents immediately. It will likely be some time before the use of electronic documents becomes dominant
                                    and perhaps well beyond that before paper documents disappear altogether from the conveyancing process. In recognition of that fact, paragraph (4) requires the recorder to continue to accept paper documents even after
                                    establishing an electronic recording system. This is a mandatory and not an elective provision.

                                    taxes to the other office or offices. If the prior approval and the fee or tax paying processes are not conjoined with the electronic recording process, it will not be possible to effectuate the speedy electronic recording

                        Just as with the definition of an "electronic document" in section 2 of this act, the moment at which the character of the document will be determined is the moment it is received by the recorder. If a document is received by the recorder in a non-electronic
                        form, it is a "paper" document regardless of whether it has a prior or subsequent existence as an electronic document.

                        of the functions described in this subsection are subject to the standards of the Commission or agency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since this act also applies to "Torrens" title registration systems, a recorder who operates a title registration system may choose to implement the functions of receiving, indexing, storing, archiving, and transmitting electronic documents for the title
                        registration system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This paragraph also provides that the recorder must index the paper documents together with electronic documents as part of a single indexing system. This will enable a title examiner to make a single search of one index for the purpose of ascertaining
                        all relevant instruments that were recorded after the initiation of electronic recording. It avoids the inefficient and costly process of maintaining and searching two separate indexing systems - one for electronic documents and
                        one for paper documents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Efficiency also suggests that the unified index would be an electronic one. It would be more efficient to store the index information from paper documents in an electronic index than to convert and store the index information from electronic documents
                        in a paper index system. Electronic index information can be sorted and managed more easily and efficiently than paper index information. In addition, an electronic index can be searched more quickly and without the searcher's
                        physical presence in the recorder's office. However, the act does not require the index chosen by the recorder to be an electronic one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paragraph (5) relates to the conversion of "new" paper documents received by the recorder after the implementation of an electronic recording system. It does not require that such newly-received paper documents be converted and stored in an electronic
                        form. It does, however, permit the recorder to make a conversion of those paper documents into an electronic form and store them with electronic documents received by the recorder. If the paper documents are not converted into
                        an electronic form, the recorder must continue to store them and, as public documents, the recorder must continue to provide a process for accessing them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the recorder does not convert "new" paper documents into an electronic form, the usefulness and efficiency of the electronic recording system may be limited. A title examiner will have to obtain physical access to the paper document information in
                        traditional ways. Since electronic documents are stored electronically, the examiner will have to access two different storage systems - one for paper documents and one for electronic documents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dealing with "old" document information is more challenging than dealing with "new" documents simply because of the potentially large expenditure of time and money needed to convert a significant volume of paper information extending over many past years
                        into an electronic form. The time period over which a fully-effective conversion would extend probably spans a period of forty to sixty or more years, depending on the customary period of search in the jurisdiction. Without the
                        conversion, the usefulness and efficiency of the electronic recording system is limited, at least until the passage of a period after the adoption of the act that is equal to the customary period of search.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nature and operation of the electronic payment system is not specified. The selection is subject to standards set by the Electronic Recording Commission or state agency and the choice of the recorder. Among others, the alternatives might include a
                        subscription service with a regular billing system, a prepayment system with recording and access charges applied against a deposited amount, or a payment per individual service system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, a document may first need to be submitted to the county assessor or treasurer to determine whether prior real estate taxes have been paid or whether current ones are due. Under current practice that submission and approval might have to be
                        accomplished in a physical process independent of the electronic recording process. If a tax or fee is due, that sum might also have to be paid by check or other non-electronic process to the treasurer. Procedures such as these
                        will delay the electronic recording process and will limit the achievement of a speedy, efficient electronic recording system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paragraph (8) permits and encourages the recorder to enter into agreements with other county and state offices for the purpose of implementing processes that will allow the simultaneous satisfaction of all conditions precedent to recording and the payment
                        of all fees and taxes in a single transaction. Any fees and taxes paid by the recording party will be allocated among the recorder and the other offices in accordance with their agreements.

                        In subsection (b), the General Statutes Commission amended subdivision (b)(8) by replacing the phrase "other officials of a state or a political subdivision thereof, or of the United States," with "other officials of this State or a political subdivision

                        was changed to "law." In subdivision (b)(8), the phrase "prior approvals and conditions precedent" was changed to "conditions."

                                    or agency and have developed a protocol or standard to deal with it. Furthermore, since these bodies are national in scope, they will likely already have considered the needs of recording districts of varying size,
                                    population and resources when promulgating their standards.

                                    real estate brokers, and notaries public. It must also consider the views of governmental offices that may interact with the recording offices, such as clerks of court, taxing authorities, and the office of the Secretary

                                    the needs of counties of varying size, population and resources. Because most states are quite diverse in the size, population and resources of their recording venues, it is important that the Electronic Recording Commission or state agency consider all
                                    of their needs. Standards that are designed only for large, populous and well-funded recording districts may not promote the development of electronic recording in smaller, less-populous and not-as-well funded recording
                                    districts. This subsection recognizes that the standards should promote the overall good of the entire state and not just the good of certain types of recording venues. Thus, the commission is advised to consider the
                                    needs of the entire spectrum of recording districts.

                                    information security for electronic documents. When considering the adoption of standards, the commission or state agency is directed to consider a number of security concerns.

                        Alternative A creates a state Electronic Recording Commission and provides for its general composition. The exact size of the board is to be determined by the legislature. The appointment of the commissioners is to be made by the governor or another state
                        official or governmental body determined by the legislature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under Alternative A, the majority of the members of the commission must be recorders. Recorders, by the fact that the standards adopted by the Electronic Recording Commission will affect the operation of their offices, have a professional interest in
                        generating efficient, functional standards. If the recorders are appointed from sufficiently diverse recording venues, they can also provide valuable input as to the needs of recording districts of varying size, population and
                        resources, as described further in subsection (b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alternative B delegates the duty to adopt standards to implement this act to an existing state agency. In some states this oversight of the recording process, and in some cases the electronic recording process, has already been delegated to an existing
                        state agency. In like fashion, some state legislatures may wish to delegate these duties to an existing state agency instead of creating a new commission as is directed in Alternative A.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the state agency has oversight of many diverse functions, it might prove useful for the agency to establish a subdivision to implement and adopt standards for this act. The agency or subdivision might also wish to establish a regular process to obtain
                        advice from persons with expertise in the area of recordings, particularly in electronic recordings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the objectives of this act is to facilitate the efficient use of electronic recording within the state and among the various adopting states. This subsection directs the Electronic Recording Commission or state agency to seek to keep the standards
                        and practices of the recording offices in states using electronic recording in harmony and uniformity with each other. Ease of user access and interoperability and the promotion of interstate commerce depend highly on a similarity
                        of standards and operating processes among the various recording offices. However, differences in operating processes and their governing standards may be justified based on legitimate differences that exist from venue to venue.
                        The commission is not required to adopt the same standards and practices that exist in other states, but must give them serious consideration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When adopting, amending or repealing standards the commission or agency must consider the following factors:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The authenticity of documents stored in any recording system is of utmost importance. If forged or invalid documents are accepted for recording, landowners and those depending on their titles can be seriously affected. Thus, the commission or state agency
                        is directed to consider standards that would protect an electronic recording system from accepting and recording documents that are not authentic and genuine. Furthermore, even if an electronic document is authentic in its origin,
                        it may be possible to intercept it in transmission and change its content. Such a change could cause problems equally problematic as those caused by an originally forged document. Thus, the commission or state agency is directed
                        to consider standards that would protect documents from tampering and inaccuracies caused during transmission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The subsection also directs the commission or state agency to consider standards for the proper preservation of electronic documents once they are in the electronic recording system. If an unauthorized person were to be able to "hack" or enter the electronic
                        recording system, that person could cause considerable damage and injury to the records and persons having an interest in the affected land. Thus, the commission or state agency is directed to consider standards protecting the
                        electronic land records system from unauthorized intrusion and tampering. Finally, the subsection directs the commission or state agency to consider adequate standards for the preservation of electronic documents. If there should
                        only be one copy of the electronic land records and it is destroyed by an electronic or physical catastrophe, the security of the land records system would be seriously impaired. Thus, the commission or state agency should consider
                        the means and methodology of preserving and replicating the electronic land records so that the recorder can recover from such a catastrophe with no loss of information.

                        This section blends the Uniform Act's alternatives for a standard-setting body and adds other provisions in order to produce a regulatory structure similar to the current regulatory structure in this State for setting standards for paper documents filed
                        with a register of deeds. Subsections (a) through (f) replace subsection (a) of the Uniform Act. Subsection (g) is substantially the same as subsection (b) of the Uniform Act with conforming changes to reflect the different regulatory

                        This section recites the importance of uniformity among the adopting states when applying and construing the act. It is more general than the uniformity stated in section 5 for the Electronic Recording Commission or state agency when implementing or adopting
                        standards. This section seeks uniformity in all situations when the application or interpretation of the act itself is considered or under review.

                        Formal Deed Regarded as Feoffment in Enforcing Parol Trust. - In properly constituted cases indicating the propriety of equitable relief in declaring and enforcing a parol trust, the formal deed by which the legal title is held is regarded as a feoffment
                        not inconsistent with the trust sought to be established. Thompson v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 792</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 556 (1944).

        Where it appears from the face of a corporate deed that the corporate seal has not been affixed,

                        against creditors and purchasers. However, the order of probate is sufficient to authorize its registration as a contract to convey under G.S. 47-18. Haas v. Rendleman, 62 F.2d 701 (4th Cir. 1933), cert. denied, 289 U.S. 750, 53

                    of the register of deeds in the county in which the real property is located. A transfer of the promissory note or other instrument secured by the deed of trust, mortgage, or other security interest that constitutes an effective assignment
                    under the law of this State shall be an effective assignment of the deed of trust, mortgage, or other security instrument. The assignee of the note shall have the right to enforce all obligations contained in the promissory note or
                    other agreement, and all the rights of the assignor in the deed of trust, mortgage, or other security instrument, including the right to substitute the trustee named in any deed of trust, and to exercise any power of sale contained
                    in the instrument without restriction. The provisions of this section do not preclude the recordation of a written assignment of a deed of trust, mortgage, or other security instrument, with or without the promissory note or other
                    instrument that it secures, provided that the assignment complies with applicable law.

                            The recording statute for deeds of trust, G.S. 47-20, is virtually identical to this section, governing outright conveyances, and the two are construed alike. These statutes provide in essence that the party winning "the race to the courthouse" will have
                            priority in title disputes. Schuman v. Roger Baker &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 313, 319 S.E.2d 308 (1984); Schiller v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite>                            90, 345 S.E.2d 444 (1986).

                            valid as between the parties and as to all others except purchasers for value and creditors. King v. McRackan, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 621</cite>, 84 S.E. 1027 (1915), rehearing denied,

         Transformation into Pure Race State.
        </b> - The Connor Act of 1885, currently codified as this section, transformed North Carolina into a "pure race" state for the recording of deeds, contracts to convey, and other instruments affecting interests in land;
                            under its terms, no such instrument is effective as against either lien creditors, or purchasers for value, until the time of its registration. Love v. United States, 889 F. Supp. 1548 (E.D.N.C. 1994).

                            The purpose of North Carolina's recording statute is to enable intending purchasers and encumbrancers to rely with safety on the public record concerning the status of land titles. However, the recording statute only protects innocent purchasers for value.

                            Section Provides a Method for Determining Nature of Title. - This section was enacted for the purpose of providing a plan and a method by which an intending purchaser or encumbrancer can safely determine just what kind of a title he is in fact obtaining.

                            Section Determining Conflicting Claims and Priorities. - The primary purpose and intent of the legislature, in the passage of the Connor Act of 1885 (this section) was to establish a known and ready method for the settlement of conflicting claims and
                            priorities arising from registrations. Spence v. Foster Pottery Co., <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 218</cite>, 117 S.E. 32 (1923).

                            The purpose of this section is to point out to prospective purchasers the one place where they must go to find the condition of land titles - the public registry. Hayes v. Ricard, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 687</cite>,

                            Title Examiner Must Read Prior Conveyances. - In title examination when checking the grantor's out conveyances, it is not enough to merely insure that the subject property was not conveyed out previously. The title examiner must read the prior conveyances
                            to determine that they do not contain restrictions applicable to the use of the subject property. Stegall v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 617, 344 S.E.2d 803 (1986).

                            The object of registration in the county where the land lies is to give notice to creditors and purchasers for value or others whose rights might otherwise be seriously and unjustly impaired by the deed. Warren v. Williford,

                            Records as Notice. - The purpose of the registration laws is to give notice, and where the index is sufficient to put a careful and prudent examiner upon inquiry, the records are notice of all matters which would be discovered by reasonable inquiry; but
                            the records are intended to be self-sufficient, and a person examining a title is not required to go out upon the premises and ascertain who is in possession and under what claim, the proviso of this section being applicable
                            only to deeds executed prior to December 1, 1885. Dorman v. Goodman, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 406</cite>, 196 S.E. 352 (1938).

                            Bank was not entitled to relief from a bankruptcy court order cancelling its deed of trust where, inter alia, its two year delay in seeking relief was not reasonable, and it would create significant unfair prejudice to an innocent bona fide purchaser
                            who gave fair value for clear title. That order unambiguously cancelled the bank's deed of trust, and a certified copy of the order was recorded in the register of deeds in compliance with North Carolina's race recording statute,
                            the purpose of which was to enable purchasers to rely with safety upon an examination of records. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. AMH Roman Two NC, LLC, 859 F.3d 295 (4th Cir. 2017).

                            Effect of Reference in Registered Deed to Unregistered Encumbrance. - A reference in a registered deed to an unregistered encumbrance, if made with sufficient certainty, creates a trust or agreement that the property is held subject thereto. Bourne v.

                            Principles applicable to sufficiency of references necessary to impart vitality to a prior unregistered encumbrance may be stated as follows: (1) The creditor holding the prior unregistered encumbrance must be named and identified with certainty; (2)
                            The property must be conveyed "subject to" or in subordination to such prior encumbrance; (3) The amount of such prior encumbrance must be definitely stated; and (4) The reference to the prior unregistered encumbrance must
                            amount to a ratification and adoption thereof. Bourne v. Lay &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 33</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 769 (1965), holding a reference to a lease in a deed not sufficient to
                            make the registered deed subordinate to the unregistered lease; Terry v. Brothers Inv. Co., <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 334 S.E.2d 469 (1985).

         Rents Already Accrued and Rents Accruing in Future.
        </b> - North Carolina recognizes a difference between rents which have already accrued and rents which will be accruing in the future. Already accrued rents are personalty (choses in action) while rents accruing in
                            the future are incorporeal hereditaments - interests in real property. Thus the recordation of the deed of trust was necessary to perfect the security interest in rents accruing in the future. Westchase I Assocs. v. Lincoln

         Necessity for Recording Condemnation Judgment in Favor of United States.
        </b> - A careful consideration of the Conformity Act, G.S. 1-237, in relation to docketing judgments of federal courts, and of this section, does not sustain the position that a condemnation judgment in favor of the
                            United States must be recorded in the county where the land lies and cross-indexed in order to protect the United States' ownership in land that it has acquired. The government stands in a position quite different from an individual,
                            and if the statute normally applies to an individual, it may not be applicable against the United States. United States v. Norman Lumber Co., 127 F. Supp. 518 (M.D.N.C. 1955), aff'd, 223 F.2d 868 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 350

                            Recordation Raises Rebuttable Presumption That Deed was Duly Executed and Delivered. - When a deed is duly recorded as required by law, the public record thereof is admissible in evidence and raises a rebuttable presumption that the original was duly
                            executed and delivered. Williams v. North Carolina State Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 588</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 889 (1974).

                            Registration Does Not Cure Lack of Mental Capacity. - Where a deed, void for mental incapacity of the grantor to make it, is registered prior to one theretofore made by the same grantor, for a valuable consideration, when the grantor had sufficient mental
                            capacity, the registration under this section can give no effect to the invalid deed, and the valid deed, though subsequently registered, will be effective. Thompson v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 500</cite>,

                            apply, and defendant's rights were superior to those of plaintiff under the registered deed, even though the paper-writing giving defendant a life estate was not registered, since the protection of this section extends only
                            to creditors and purchasers for value. Twitty v. Cochran, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 265</cite>, 199 S.E. 29 (1938).

                            In a sale of lands in proceedings for partition, the conversion from realty to personalty does not take place until the land is sold and the sale is confirmed by the court. Therefore, an unregistered deed made by some of the cotenants of their interest
                            in the lands held in common is not good as against a subsequently made and registered deed by the same grantors of the same interest, to another, after the decree of sale for partition, but before the sale was confirmed. McLean

                            Right to Easement. - Under this section, where a grantor conveys land by registered deed creating an easement in land reserved by the grantor, his grantee is entitled to the easement unaffected by an unregistered contract to convey the reserved land executed
                            prior to the deed. Walker v. Phelps, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 344</cite>, 162 S.E. 727 (1932).

                            Allegation that third persons conspired to deprive plaintiff of his rights under an unregistered option does not state a cause of action against such third persons, since in the absence of registration third persons have a legal right to deal with the
                            property as if there were no option and an agreement to do a lawful act cannot constitute a wrongful conspiracy. Eller v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 418</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 266 (1949).

                            Priorities Between Unregistered Deed and Execution of Judgment. - A sale of land under the execution of a judgment in the due course and practice of the court, and conveyance to the purchaser at the sale, regular in form and sufficiently describing the

                            for the balance of the purchase price had been given by the grantee of the debtor and duly registered before the docketing of the judgment under the execution of which the conveyance had been made to the purchaser at the sale.

                            Extent of Right of Judgment Creditor or Purchaser at Execution Sale. - A judgment creditor or purchaser at an execution sale can acquire no greater lien or interest in the property of the judgment debtor than such debtor had at the time the judgment lien

                            should not be registered until the payment of the purchase price, took subject to the lien of a judgment creditor of the grantor, whose judgment was rendered and docketed between execution and registration of the deed. Board

                            Priority of Judgment Obtained Before Registration of Prior Deed - In General. - Where a judgment is obtained against a grantor of land subsequent to the execution of the conveyance, but prior to the time of its registration, the lien of the judgment has
                            priority over the title of the grantee, and the lands conveyed are subject to execution under the judgment. Maxton Realty Co. v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 5</cite>, 86 S.E. 714 (1915).

                            Priority of Judgment Obtained Before Registration of Prior Deed - Agreement Between Parties as to Registration. - Under the provisions of this section, the holder of a subsequently registered conveyance takes subject to the lien of a judgment creditor
                            of the grantor where the judgment was rendered and docketed before the registration of the deed, even though there was an agreement between the grantor and the grantee that such deed should not be registered till the payment

                            Priority of Judgment Obtained Before Registration of Prior Deed - Judgment Against Grantee. - Where a judgment has been obtained and docketed against the grantee, the lien thereof immediately attaches upon the registration of his deed, and cannot be defeated
                            by a deed in trust subsequently registered carrying out the agreement theretofore resting only in parol; and the consideration recited in the grantee's deed is immaterial. Colonial Trust Co. v. Sterchie Bros.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 21</cite>, 85 S.E. 40 (1915).

                        <p>
                            When a grantee accepts a conveyance subject to an outstanding claim or interest evidenced by an unrecorded instrument executed by his grantor, he takes the property burdened by that claim or interest; by accepting such a deed he ratifies the unrecorded
                            instrument and agrees to take the property subject to it and is estopped to deny the unrecorded instrument's validity. This principle derives from the theory that reference to the unrecorded encumbrance, if made with sufficient
                            certainty, creates a trust or agreement that the property is held subject to the encumbrance. Terry v. Brothers Inv. Co., <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 334 S.E.2d 469 (1985).

                            Collateral Attack by Creditors for Want of Registration. - The want of registration does not invalidate an instrument so that creditors, merely as such, may treat it as a nullity in a collateral proceeding; but it is void against proceedings instituted
                            by them and prosecuted to a sale of the property or acquisition of a lien, as against all who derive title thereunder. Brem v. Lockhart, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 191</cite> (1885); Boyd v. Turpin,

                            Liberal Construction of Subsection (b). - The words of what is now subsection (b) of this section should receive a liberal construction so as to give full force and effect to the spirit and intention of the section. Cowen v. Withrow,
                            <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 736</cite>, 17 S.E. 575 (1893).

                            Under this section a conveyance of land made prior to the 1885 amendment, known as the Connor Act, is not valid against creditors or bona fide purchasers, unless registered before January 1, 1886. Phillips v. Hodges,

                            The use of the words "unregistered deed" in subsection (b) of this section is in their broad generic sense and has reference to the same scope as the words "conveyance of land, or contract to convey, or lease of land" as used in subsection (a) of this
                            section. McNeill v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 283</cite>, 59 S.E. 689 (1907).

                            Execution Purchaser with Notice Prior to 1885 Subordinate to Prior Unregistered Deed. - The provision of subsection (b) of this section that no purchase of land from a donor, bargainor or lessor shall avail or pass title as against any unregistered deed
                            executed prior to December 1, 1885, where there is constructive or actual notice, applies as well to a purchaser of land at an execution sale with actual notice as to a purchaser from the "bargainor or lessor." Cowen v. Withrow,
                            <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 736</cite>, 17 S.E. 575 (1893).

                            A deed executed prior to the act of 1885, but not registered until after the registration of a mortgage from the same grantor, is competent evidence to show title in the grantee, he being in possession before the passage of the said act. Laton v. Crowell,

                            Statute Inapplicable Because of Superior Federal Tax Lien. - Because a buyer's claim to a parcel based upon a quitclaim deed given by a village following a foreclosure sale was subordinate to a claim based upon a superior federal tax lien, North Carolina's
                            recordation statute did not apply. Winning the race to the courthouse did not upset the rules of lien priority established by state and federal law, including federal preemption when those laws conflicted. Henkel v. Triangle

                            Short-Term Parol Leases. - The fact that parol leases for not more than three years are excepted from the operation of this section is not to be interpreted as meaning that a lessee under such lease is protected at all hazards or that his rights are superior
                            to those of a bona fide purchaser for value from the lessor. These short-term parol tenancies are merely exempted from the operation of this section. This being so, one must look for guidance to the law as it stood prior to
                            the passage of this section and as it now stands where the section has no application. Perkins v. Langdon, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 159</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 634 (1953).

                            must be recorded. Herring v. Volume Merchandise, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 221</cite>, 106 S.E.2d 197 (1958).

                            Agreement to Release Mortgage. - An unexecuted verbal agreement, made by a mortgagee for a valuable consideration, to release a real estate mortgage does not come within the statute of frauds, and it logically follows, if such an agreement is not required
                            to be in writing to be enforceable as between the parties, that certainly it is not required to be recorded to be enforceable as between the parties. Nye v.

                            Because a real estate installment sales contract was recorded before a later transferee's deed to the same property was recorded, and because the buyers under the contract paid all money due under the contract, the buyers had valid title to the property
                            and, pursuant to G.S. 47-18, were protected against the transferee, a subsequent purchaser for value. Watson v. Millers Creek Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 631 S.E.2d

                            Heir Not Protected. - The recording act protects only creditors of the grantor, bargainor, or lessor and purchaser for value against an unregistered conveyance of land. The same reasoning which prevents a party from introducing into evidence against a
                            lien creditor or purchaser for value a deed invalidly registered does not apply to exclude an invalidly registered deed introduced against a party claiming an interest in the land by descent. An heir is not a purchaser for
                            value entitled to the protection of the recording act. Hi-Fort, Inc. v. Burnette, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 428, 257 S.E.2d 85 (1979).

                            Alleged innocent purchaser for value of mortgaged real property on which the mortgage was assigned to a mortgagee was not entitled to judgment on the pleadings in the mortgagee's suit to restore lien priority because nothing showed the mortgagee or the
                            mortgagee's assignor were responsible for the mortgage's release, were neglectful, misplaced confidence, received actual satisfaction, or benefitted from a transaction resulting in the release, so the mortgagee was entitled
                            to the equitable exception to pure race priority for an unauthorized discharge, despite having bought the note and deed of trust while priority was being litigated. Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc'y, FSB v. Mortgage Elec. Registration

                            Creditors Put Upon Same Plane as Purchasers. - No distinction is made in the statute or in the opinions of the court construing and applying the statute between creditors and purchasers for value. No conveyance of land is valid to pass any property from
                            the donor or grantor, against either creditors or purchasers for value, but from the registration thereof. As to a purchaser for value who has recorded his deed, it has been held that a prior deed from the same grantor, unregistered,
                            does not exist, as a conveyance or as color of title. The same is true as against the creditors. Eaton v. Doub, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 14</cite>, 128 S.E. 494 (1925).

                            Volunteers and Donees Not Protected. - For lack of timely registration, this section only postpones or subordinates a deed older in date to creditors and purchasers for value. As against volunteers or donees, the older deed, though not registered, will,
                            as a rule, prevail. Tyner v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 110</cite>, 54 S.E. 1008 (1906).

                            While the cancellation of a preexisting debt may be sufficient consideration to constitute the grantee in a registered deed from the debtor a purchaser for value within the protection of the Connor Act (this section), so as to take free from the claim
                            of the grantee in a prior unregistered deed from the debtor, where the debtor transfers the property without consideration to a third person, who in turn transfers the property to the creditor without any consideration moving
                            from the creditor to such third person, the creditor cannot maintain that the cancellation of the debt constitutes him a purchaser for value so as to be protected under the Connor Act, since his deed from the third person is
                            not supported by any consideration, and it is required that the creditor be a "purchaser for value from the donor, bargainor, or lessor" in order to be protected. Sansom v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 432</cite>,

                            As to a purchaser for value from the common grantor, the rule applies to one in possession, under an unregistered deed, who has enhanced the value of the land by improvements, even though such improvements were made in good faith. Eaton v. Doub,

                            Tort-Feasor Neither a Purchaser Nor a Creditor. - A tort-feasor whose negligence has damaged a chattel in the rightful possession of the mortgagor is neither a purchaser nor a creditor within the contemplation of our registration laws; an action may be
                            maintained against him for the consequent damage either by the mortgagor or mortgagee, and a settlement with one will preclude a recovery by the other. Harris v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 480</cite>,

                            land conjointly with her husband at the time of the sale and of the execution of the sheriff's deed to the plaintiff is not within the saving clause of the act, as the plaintiff does not take as purchaser from the "donor, bargainor

         Unrecorded Deed Held Valid as Between Debtors and Creditor, But Ineffective Against Rest of World.
        </b> - A 1997 deed, which was secured by the related deed of trust, was the only deed of record on the petition date. Therefore, it followed that while the unrecorded 2003 deed may have been valid as between the debtors
                            and the creditor, it was ineffective against the rest of the world. In re Carpenter, - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Mar. 2, 2010).

                            Unrecorded Lease. - Lessee's claims against a purchaser were properly dismissed under the Connor Act, G.S. 47-18(a), because: (1) the initial lease was for more than three years and was never recorded; (2) the purchaser recorded its option to purchase
                            the property before the lease with its right of first refusal was recorded; (3) the allegedly fraudulent actions of false representations that the lease had expired, failure to comply with the registration requirement in the
                            first amended lease, and shell transfers of the property, were done by the sellers, not the purchasers, and did not constitute fraud under the Connor Act.

                            Trial court did not err in ruling that the right of first refusal (ROFR) agreement in a lessee's benefit was enforceable and that purchasers were not entitled to specific performance of an option agreement to buy the property from the lessor because they
                            were not innocent purchasers for value; the fact that the ROFR agreement was not recorded did not protect the subsequent option agreement because under the statute, a right of first refusal did not have to be recorded in order
                            to be valid. Anderson v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 129, 818 S.E.2d 144 (2018).

                            Actual Knowledge Not Sufficient Notice of Restrictive Covenant. - It is well settled in the state that a restrictive covenant is not enforceable, either at law or in equity, against a subsequent purchaser of property burdened by the covenant unless notice
                            of the covenant is contained in an instrument in his chain of title. Unlike in many states, actual knowledge, no matter how full and formal, is not sufficient to bind a purchaser in the state with notice of the existence of

                            to compel specific performance, since prior to the 1975 amendment this section did not apply to options. Lawing v. Jaynes, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 418</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 162 (1974).

                            Registration Is Not Notice as to After-Acquired Interest. - A written contract executed by a tenant in common without the knowledge or authorization of his cotenants to sell the timber on the entire tract was recorded. The tenant in common later acquired
                            an additional interest in the land. It was held that registration was constructive notice to all subsequent purchasers as to the tenant's original interest, but the vendee's right to demand conveyance of the timber as to the
                            after-acquired interest rested upon the personal contract of the vendor, which was not required to be recorded by this section, and therefore registration was not notice to subsequent purchasers as to such after-acquired title.

                            Registration of Defectively Probated Deed Ineffective. - The registration of a deed upon an unauthorized probate is invalid, and it cannot be introduced in evidence for the purpose of showing an essential link in the chain of title. Allen v. Burch,
                            <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 524</cite>, 55 S.E. 354 (1906).

                        <p>
                            In order for a registered deed to give constructive notice to creditors or purchasers for value, the probate must not be defective upon its face as to a material requirement, and where the probate is taken upon the examination of an attesting witness
                            it must actually or constructively appear upon the face of the probate that the certificate was made upon evidence taken of the subscribing witness under oath, and if not so appearing the registration of the deed is insufficient
                            to give the statutory notice. McClure v. Crow, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 657</cite>, 146 S.E. 713 (1929).

                            taken by a notary public in some other state, and there is no evidence that the grantee in the commissioner's deed under the foreclosure of a mortgage had actual notice of the defect. County Sav. Bank v. Tolbert,

                            In General. - Formerly an unregistered deed was in all cases color of title if sufficient in form. Hunter v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 285</cite> (1885). After the passage of the Connor Act in 1885 it was held that
                            an unregistered deed was not color of title. Austin v. Staten, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 783</cite>, 36 S.E. 338 (1900).

                            The question was again considered in Collins v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 106</cite>, 43 S.E. 579 (1903), and the ruling in Austin v. Staten was modified so that it only applied in favor of the holder of a subsequent
                            deed executed upon a valuable consideration, and the court has since then consistently adhered to the latter decision. Janney v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 400</cite>, 53 S.E. 863 (1906); Burwell v. Chapman,

                            Where one makes a deed for land, for a valuable consideration, and the grantee fails to register it, but enters into possession thereunder, and remains therein for more than 7 years, such deed does not constitute color of title and bar the entry of a
                            grantee, in a subsequent deed for a valuable consideration, who has duly registered his deed. Collins v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 106</cite>, 43 S.E. 579 (1903).

                            Except in cases coming within this rule, the rights acquired by adverse possession for 7 years under color of title are not disturbed or affected by this section. Roberts v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 164</cite>,

                            Adverse Possession Under Deeds Foreign to True Title. - The principle that under this section an unregistered deed does not constitute color of title does not extend to a claim by adverse possession held continuously for the requisite time under deeds
                            "foreign" to the true title or entirely independent of the title under which the plaintiff makes his claim. Janney v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 400</cite>, 53 S.E. 863 (1906).

                            As Against Subsequent Deed Duly Registered. - Where one makes a deed for land for a valuable consideration and the grantee fails to register it, but enters into possession thereunder and remains therein for more than seven years, such deed does not constitute
                            color of title and bar the entry of a grantee in a subsequent deed for a valuable consideration who has duly registered his deed. King v. McRackan, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 621</cite>, 84 S.E.
                            1027 (1915), rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 752</cite>, 88 S.E. 226 (1916).

                            As Against Judgment Creditors. - The possession of a grantee under an unregistered deed of lands is not under color of title as against subsequent judgment creditors of his grantor, who have thus obtained their liens on the locus in quo, the source of
                            title being a common one, nor can the grantee establish his rights to betterments. Eaton v. Doub, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 14</cite>, 128 S.E. 494 (1925).

                            paper chain of title from a common source. Dye v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 309</cite>, 107 S.E. 138 (1921).

                            When the registration is made, creditors of the mortgagor are able to avail themselves of their legal remedy against the equity of redemption in the land. This publicity affords the creditors all the benefit they can reasonably

                            meet before successfully asserting an interest in rents and profits of a mortgaged property against third parties. It is designed to protect third parties. In re Westchase I Assocs., 119 Bankr. 521 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. 1990).

                            Bank was not entitled to relief from a bankruptcy court order cancelling its deed of trust where, inter alia, its two year delay in seeking relief was not reasonable, and it would create significant unfair prejudice to an innocent bona fide purchaser
                            who gave fair value for clear title. That order unambiguously cancelled the bank's deed of trust, and a certified copy of the order was recorded in the register of deeds in compliance with North Carolina's race recording statute,
                            the purpose of which was to enable purchasers to rely with safety upon an examination of records. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. AMH Roman Two NC, LLC, 859 F.3d 295 (4th Cir. 2017).

                            Mortgagees in unregistered mortgage had no priority as against assets of corporate mortgagor in receivership. This is so for the reason that by adjudication of insolvency and the appointment of the receiver, the creditors at large of the corporation,
                            represented by the receiver, became in legal contemplation creditors for a valuable consideration within the meaning of this section, and therefore, the deed of trust as to the receiver was void. Eno Inv. Co. v. Protective

                            In a case in which a trial court granted summary judgment in favor of a bank, which declared that a deed of trust filed by the bank had priority over and was superior to any interest created by the deed of trust filed by a mortgage company, even though
                            the mortgage company recorded its deed of trust before the bank filed its deed of trust, the mortgage company's deed of trust failed to name a trustee and failed to contain a proper description of the real property to be conveyed
                            to the trustee. The mortgage company could not reform the deed of trust because the general rule was that reformation would not be granted if the rights of an innocent bona fide purchaser would thereby be prejudiced. Fifth

                            Because a bona fide purchaser of the parcel would not have been charged with notice of the bank's lien based on an examination of the parcel identifier number index when the bankruptcy petition was filed (the deed of trust, while recorded as to a different
                            contiguous parcel, was not so recorded as to the parcel at issue), even if the purchaser had knowledge of the lien, the trustee likewise was not imputed with such knowledge; therefore, the trustee was properly allowed to avoid
                            the lien under 11 U.S.C.S.

                            creditors and purchasers for value are entitled to rely on the record of the instrument as written and recorded, and as to them the mortgage was not entitled to reformation. Lowery v. Wilson,

         Recordation Necessary to Perfect Security Interest in Rents Accruing in Future.
        </b> - North Carolina recognizes a difference between rents which have already accrued and rents which will be accruing in the future. Already accrued rents are personalty (choses in action) while rents accruing in
                            the future are incorporeal hereditaments - interests in real property. Thus the recordation of the deed of trust was necessary to perfect the security interest in rents accruing in the future. Westchase I Assocs. v. Lincoln

                            Purchase-Money Deed of Trust Executed by Husband and Registered Prior to Deed to Wife. - Where the owner of lands deeded them to wife, according to the language of the registered instrument, and husband alone executed a purchase-money deed of trust on
                            the lands, which was registered prior to the registration of the deed in fee to the wife, the records were insufficient to show that the husband had any interest in the land, and the purchase-money deed of trust was ineffective
                            as against creditors or subsequent purchasers for value from the wife, and where the husband and wife thereafter executed a mortgage, which was duly registered, the mortgagee was entitled to foreclose same upon default as against
                            those claiming title by foreclosure under the purchase-money deed of trust, and this result was not affected by the fact that the mortgage, in the clause warranting title, referred to the purchase-money deed of trust by page

                            The personal representative of a deceased mortgagor stands in the shoes of the latter. Hence plaintiff, holding an unregistered second mortgage on the lands of the defendant's intestate, was entitled to his lien upon the funds derived from the sale in
                            excess of the first mortgage, in preference to other creditors of the deceased. McBrayer v. Harrill, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 712</cite>, 68 S.E. 204 (1910).

                            The personal representative takes only that title which the deceased had in the property at the time of his death, and an unrecorded mortgage lien has the same status as against the personal representative that it had against the deceased, regardless
                            of whether the estate is solvent or insolvent. Coastal Sales Co. v. Weston, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 621</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 267 (1957).

                            Where the parties intended deed to pass entire property, but through a mutual mistake of the parties, it failed to do so, defendant grantor held, as a constructive trustee for grantee, that portion of the land which the parties intended to be conveyed.

                            waived accrued before the bank began its lending relationship with the debtor.

                            or mortgage is valid as against general creditors from its registration. National Bank v. Hill, 226 F. 102 (E.D.N.C. 1915). See also, In re Cunningham, 64 F.2d 296 (4th Cir. 1933); In re Finley, 6 F. Supp. 105 (M.D.N.C. 1933).

                            creditors. Thus, the mortgagee under an unrecorded mortgage has a lien on the property as against the administratrix of the mortgagor's estate superior to the claim of general creditors of the estate who had not fastened a
                            lien upon the property at the time of intestate's death. Coastal Sales Co. v. Weston, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 621</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 267 (1957).

                            and his rights are not affected by a prior unregistered mortgage. Moore v. Ragland, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 343</cite> (1876).

                            registered mortgage was marked upon its face "second mortgage." Nor can notice aliunde advantage the holder of the mortgage first executed. Story v. Slade, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 596</cite>,

                            registered before the trust deed, the debt secured by the trust deed must be paid by the mortgagee from the proceeds of the sale of the land, but the mortgagee is entitled to the possession of the land. Bank v. Vass,

                            Where the subsequent mortgage of the same property recites that it is made subject to a prior mortgage, such recitation is more than a mere notice of the prior encumbrance; it establishes a trust in equity in favor of the prior encumbrancer, even though

                            by the fact that the mortgage third in execution contained a reference to a first and second deed of trust, and contained a warranty against encumbrances "except as above stated," the references being insufficient to show that

                        Deed of Dual Character. - A deed combining the two characters of a deed of trust to secure creditors and a deed of settlement in trust for a wife and children may operate and have effect in both characters, provided it has been duly proved and registered.

                        A deed of settlement in trust for a wife and children, proved and registered three years after the date of its execution, was held to be valid as against creditors whose debts were contracted after such registration. Johnston v. Malcom,

                        Agreement Not a Marriage Settlement. - An agreement by which husband consented that wife could convert one tract of land, which was in no wise subject to the claims of his creditors, into another tract of land, and in which, in order to enable her to
                        make the conversion, he stipulated to allow her to hold as her separate property the price of her land until it could be reinvested in another tract of land, was not a marriage settlement falling within this section. Teague v.

                        "Making," as used in this section, means execution. The execution of a deed is not complete until the instrument is signed, sealed and delivered. Turlington v. Neighbors, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 694</cite>, 24 S.E.2d 648

                        A deed of gift is absolutely void when not registered within two years after its making. Booth v. Hairston, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 8</cite>, 141 S.E. 480 (1928); Ferguson v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 375</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Where a deed appearing on its face to be a deed of gift is not registered in two years from its execution as required by this section, it is void, and may be set aside in an action by creditors of the grantor, regardless of whether it was executed in
                        fraud of creditors. Reeves v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 362</cite>, 183 S.E. 294 (1936).

                        After two years the legislature is without power to bring a deed of gift to life again by the enactment of a statute lengthening the period in which it may be registered. Booth v. Hairston, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 8</cite>,

                        Revesting of Title in Grantor. - Between the parties thereto a deed of gift, not registered, is good during the two years after the making of it, but upon failure to register it within such time, it becomes void ab initio and title vests in the grantor.

                        Acknowledgment after Lapse of Two Years Not Re-execution. - Where the owner of lands executed a deed of gift thereto and delivered same to the grantee, and some three and a half years thereafter he acknowledged the deed and filed same for registration,
                        the acknowledgment was not a re-execution of the deed, and the deed of gift, not having been registered within two years of its execution, was void, and could not be revived by curative act of the legislature. Cutts v. McGhee,
                        <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 465</cite>, 20 S.E.2d 376 (1942).

                        Deeds Back to Grantor Held Void. - Individual who conveyed 297 acres to her two sons some 18 years before her death did not own the land involved at the time of her death despite the execution of deeds back to her from her sons, as these deeds were void,
                        because they were deeds of gift and were not recorded within two years after their execution, as this section requires; and the fact that the two deeds in question recited a consideration and were under seal did not preclude a
                        finding that they were deeds of gift. Patterson v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 315 S.E.2d 781 (1984).

                        Recorded Deed of Gift Is Valid Without Consideration. - A deed of gift, duly signed and delivered, is an executed contract. If recorded within the time prescribed by this section it is valid, as between the parties and their heirs, without good or valuable
                        consideration. Edwards v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 693</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 101 (1957).

                        Right-of-way deed which, besides reciting consideration as "One Dollar and other valuable consideration," contained a statement that the consideration for the conveyance was the obligation imposed upon grantees to maintain an all-weather driveway across
                        the right-of-way, usable by all parties, was not without consideration, and the fact that the driveway was not maintained did not convert the deed, supported by consideration, into a deed of gift. Higdon v. Davis,
                        <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 208</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 543 (1985).

                        Consideration Held Insufficient to Remove Deed from Operation of Section. - The agreement by a wife to perform ordinary marital duties is not sufficient consideration to remove a deed made to her from the operation of this section. Sprinkle v. Ponder,

                        The effect of the 1943 amendment was to require that any deed, agreement for right of way, or easement of any character be registered before it could be valid against a bona fide purchaser for value. DOT v. Humphries, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 649</cite>,

                        Prior to the 1959 amendment unrecorded right-of-way agreements were required to be recorded in order to prevail over a bona fide purchaser for value. DOT v. Humphries, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 649</cite>, 496 S.E.2d 563 (1998).

                        The provision of this section exempting decrees of condemnation from the requirement of registration was not repealed by the 1919 and 1943 amendments, and an easement created by judgment in condemnation proceedings is good as against creditors and purchasers
                        for value from the owner of the servient tenement, notwithstanding the absence of registration. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 319</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 531 (1947).

                        The provision of this section exempting decrees of courts of competent jurisdiction in condemnation proceedings from the requirement as to registration supersedes the provisions of G.S. 40-19 that a copy of the judgment in eminent domain proceedings be
                        registered in the county where the land lies, and the provision of G.S. 1-228 that judgments in which transfers of title are declared shall be registered under the same rules as are prescribed for deeds. Carolina Power &amp; Light

                        Applicability to Board of Transportation. - This section is expressly applicable to the Highway Commission (Board of Transportation). North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Nuckles, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 1</cite>, 155 S.E.2d

                        <b>
        Inapplicable to Enforcement of Easement Between Signatory Parties.
       </b> - Settlement agreement providing that a resort was permitted during a lease period to maintain certain signs on specified areas of property owned by a property owners association created an enforceable easement because
                        the parties intended to create an easement, and there was no evidence suggesting that recordation was necessary to render the easement enforceable between the signatory parties; the provisions of G.S. 47-27 were inapplicable because
                        neither innocent purchasers for value nor foreign parties were affected. Fairfield Resorts, Inc. v. Fairfield Mts. Prop. Owners Ass'n, - F. Supp. 2d - (W.D.N.C. July 18, 2007).

                    <p>
                        Invalidity of Deeds of Easements Prior to Recordation. - This section makes deeds and conveyances of easements and rights-of-way invalid as to creditors and purchasers for value prior to recordation. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Nuckles,
                        <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 1</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 772 (1967).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Priority of Duly Recorded Easement. - Where the owner of land conveys a portion thereof, together with an easement, over his remaining lands by deed duly recorded, grantees of the servient tenement, directly or by mesne conveyances, take title subject
                        to the duly recorded easement, notwithstanding that no deed in their chain of title refers to such easement. Waldrop v. Brevard, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 26</cite>, 62 S.E.2d 512 (1950).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where a property interest spans more than one county, it is only effective against other claimants in the counties in which it has been recorded. Rowe v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 441 S.E.2d 156 (1994),
                        aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 107</cite>, 455 S.E.2d 160 (1995).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Facts Constituting Notice. - If the facts disclosed in an instrument appearing in a purchaser's chain of title would naturally lead an honest and prudent person to make inquiry concerning the rights of others, these facts constituted notice of everything
                        which such inquiry, pursued in good faith and with reasonable diligence, would have disclosed. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Wortman, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 546, 167 S.E.2d 462 (1969).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Race to the Courthouse. - As North Carolina is a pure race jurisdiction, where defendants failed to register their grant of easement in Person County before plaintiffs registered their deed there, plaintiffs won the "race to the courthouse," and their
                        interest superseded the later-recorded interest claimed by defendants. Rowe v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 441 S.E.2d 156 (1994), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 107</cite>,

                    <p>
                        As a pure race state, North Carolina focuses on recordation, above and beyond anything else. DOT v. Humphries, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 649</cite>, 496 S.E.2d 563 (1998).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The General Assembly intended this section to operate under the same theory as the Connor Act, as a pure race statute. DOT v. Humphries, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 649</cite>, 496 S.E.2d 563 (1998).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Purchaser for Value. - North Carolina does not require that a purchaser for valuable consideration be an "innocent purchaser." A "purchaser for value" or a "purchaser for valuable consideration" is simply defined as one who has paid a valuable consideration
                        for the execution of an instrument of conveyance. Rowe v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 441 S.E.2d 156 (1994), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 107</cite>, 455 S.E.2d 160 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Map or Plat as Part of Deed. - A map or plat referred to in a deed becomes a part of the deed and need not be registered. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Wortman, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 546, 167 S.E.2d 462

                        Defendant's failure to record the alleged oral termination of easement did not accord plaintiff (successor to easement) a superior interest therein. Howell v. Clyde, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 717, 493 S.E.2d 323

                <p>
                    Every person who discovers that there is an error in the registration of his grant, conveyance, bill of sale or other instrument of writing, may prefer a petition to the clerk of the superior court of the county in which said writing is registered, in
                    the same manner as is directed for petitioners to correct errors in grants or patents, and if on hearing the same before said clerk it appears that errors have been committed, the clerk shall order the register of the county to correct
                    such errors and make the record conformable to the original. The petitioner must notify his grantor and every person claiming title to or having lands adjoining those mentioned in the petition, 30 days previous to preferring the same.
                    Any person dissatisfied with the judgment may appeal to the superior court as in other cases.

                        Notwithstanding G.S. 47-14 and G.S. 47-17, notice of a nonmaterial typographical or other minor error in a deed or other instrument recorded with the register of deeds may be given by recording a corrective notice affidavit. For purposes of this section,
                        an error that would affect the respective rights of any party to the instrument is not a nonmaterial typographical or minor error. If a corrective notice affidavit is conspicuously identified as a corrective notice or scrivener's
                        affidavit in its title, the register of deeds shall index the name of the affiant, the names of the original parties in the instrument, the recording information of the instrument for which the corrective notice is being given,
                        and the original parties as they are named in the affidavit. A copy of the previously recorded instrument to which the corrective notice affidavit applies may be attached to the corrective notice affidavit and need not be a certified
                        copy. To the extent the correction is inconsistent with the originally recorded instrument, and only to that extent, notice of the corrective information as provided by the affiant in the corrective notice affidavit is deemed to
                        have been given as of the time the corrective notice affidavit is registered. Nothing in this section invalidates or otherwise alters the legal effect of any instrument of correction authorized by statute in effect on the date
                        the instrument was registered.

                        Nothing in this section requires that an affidavit be attached to an original or certified copy of a previously recorded instrument that is unchanged but rerecorded. Nothing in this section requires that an affidavit be attached to a previously recorded
                        instrument with a copy of a previously recorded instrument that includes identified corrections or an original execution by a party or parties of the corrected instrument after the original recording, with proof or acknowledgment

                        affidavit identifying the correction and may attach a new acknowledgment completed as of the date the original acknowledgment took place, which shall be deemed attached to the original recording, and the instrument's priority shall

        Addition of Grantee.
       </b> - Addition of a grantee that was not named in the original deed is not the type of error that can be corrected through submission of an affidavit pursuant to G.S. 47-36.1. Therefore, a husband and a wife could not correct

                    I have discovered or have been advised of an error in the description of real property contained in one or more instruments recorded as part of a real estate-related transaction. A copy of a proposed Curative Affidavit accompanies this notice. The proposed
                    Curative Affidavit identifies the previously recorded instrument or instruments that contain the description errors that I plan to correct, the description error or errors that require correction, and the correct description of the
                    real property. If I sign and record the proposed Curative Affidavit, it will have the legal effect of correcting the erroneous property description in the listed instrument or instruments that contain the description errors. Real property
                    you own may be affected if I correct the erroneous description of the real property in the instrument or instruments identified in the proposed Curative Affidavit. You should consult with your attorney and your title insurance company,
                    if known, promptly to determine whether and the extent to which my correction of the legal description in the instrument or instruments that need to be corrected will impact your property or property rights.

        Deed of Trust Valid.

                        North Carolina's Notary Public Act by reason of the omission in the notarial acknowledgment, because North Carolina courts would not find a properly executed and recorded deed of trust invalid based solely on the omission of the

        Reference to "Other Forms of Probate".
       </b> - This section, in providing that it shall not exclude "other forms of probate which would be deemed sufficient in law," can only refer to forms of probate deemed sufficient by the common law, under which a certificate
                        showing that the officer whose duty it was to affix the seal acknowledged that he did so is sufficient. National Bank v. Hill, 226 F. 102 (E.D.N.C. 1915).

        Substantial Compliance Sufficient.
       </b> - The probate of a deed of a corporation is sufficient if it substantially shows the facts required by this section, which expressly provides that the form prescribed "shall not exclude other forms of probate." Board
                        of Comm'rs v. A.V. Wills &amp; Sons, 236 F. 362 (E.D.N.C. 1916).

                    <p>
                        Where the probate of a corporation's deed for land is in substantial compliance with this section, parol evidence is competent, in an action attacking its validity, that tends to corroborate the recitations of the probate, and to further show that the
                        president and secretary had proper authority to act therein on its behalf. Bailey v. Hassell, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 450</cite>, 115 S.E. 166 (1922).

                        While it is the better course to follow the suggested methods of this section, in the execution of a corporate chattel mortgage, there being no general law or charter provision to the contrary, it is not necessary to its validity that the witness to the
                        probate certifies in its probate that he saw the presiding member sign it, when otherwise it complies with the requirements of the general law. Merchants' &amp; Farmers' Bank v. Pearson, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 609</cite>,

                        Corporate Seal. - A corporate seal is a necessary prerequisite to a valid conveyance of real estate by a corporation. Investors Corp. v. Field Fin. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 167 S.E.2d 852 (1969).

                        This section sets out the forms of probate for a deed and other conveyances executed by a corporation and reveals the necessity of having a corporate seal. Investors Corp. v. Field Fin. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                        156, 167 S.E.2d 852 (1969).

                    <p>
                        It is not necessary to the valid probate of a deed made by a corporation that it literally follow the statutory printed forms of this section, if it substantially complies with the law regulating the probate of a conveyance of land; and where the probate
                        shows the acknowledgment of the president and secretary, each acting in his official capacity, or as representing the corporation, who is designated as "the grantor, for the purpose therein expressed," it is sufficient; and the
                        finding of the jury, upon evidence, that their officials were properly authorized to act for and in behalf of the corporation, and had so acted, and had used the word "seal," enclosed in scroll, that had been lawfully adopted for
                        the purpose, makes it a valid execution and probate of the deed as an act of the corporation itself; and were it otherwise, the defects as to the "seal" would seem to be cured under the provisions of G.S. 47-72, and as to signatures
                        of the officials by G.S. 47-73. Bailey v. Hassell, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 450</cite>, 115 S.E. 166 (1922).

                        Defective Conveyances. - When it does not appear from the probate of a corporation's deed to lands that the seal affixed is the common seal of the corporation, or that it was affixed by the proper officers of the corporation, it is not a substantial compliance
                        with this section, and the deed is ineffectual to pass title to the lands as against creditors and purchasers. Withrell v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. 82</cite>, 69 S.E. 748 (1910).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A corporation's deed is defective which fails to show by its certificate, read in connection with the deed, that the corporate officials acknowledged the instrument as the act and deed of the corporation, or that the official executing the deed in behalf
                        of and under authority from the corporation acknowledged it to be "his" act and deed, as such. Withrell v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. 82</cite>, 69 S.E. 748 (1910).

                        the seal so affixed was the seal of the corporation, the Supreme Court held that this conveyance was, therefore, ineffectual as to the corporation's auditors. Investors Corp. v. Field Fin. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                        156, 167 S.E.2d 852 (1969).

                        Acknowledgement by Individuals Instead of Officers. - The probate of a deed of a corporation by the acknowledgment of individuals instead of by its officers is fatally defective, and its registration, in consequence, is a nullity. Bernhardt v. Brown,

                        of doing it, and to save rights of property where no substantial departure from legal requirements appeared, but merely an irregularity which could be cured without injury to the rights of others. Weston v. John L. Roper Lumber
                        Co., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 263</cite>, 75 S.E. 800 (1912).

                    <p>
                        Liberal Construction. - The statutes validating defective probates and registrations of deed are remedial, and must be liberally construed to embrace all cases fairly within their scope. Weston v. John L. Roper Lumber Co.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 263</cite>, 75 S.E. 800 (1912).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scope of Original Section. - This section originally rendered valid all probates of deeds, etc., made before the officers therein named, prior to February 12, 1872; and registrations made in pursuance of such probates were held embraced within the operation
                        of the statutes, although made after that date, but before the enactment of the Code in 1883. Tatom v. White, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. 453</cite> (1886).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Applicability to Defective Probates of County Courts. - Where it was argued by counsel that this section did not refer to probates taken by the county courts, but to those of the clerks of said courts, it was held that the probates of the county courts
                        were intended to be validated. The phraseology and punctuation, as well as the grammatical construction, of the statute, lead to that conclusion. If the other meaning had been intended, the preposition "of" would have been inserted
                        before the words "courts of pleas and quarter sessions." The section also validates registrations made upon such probates. Weston v. John L. Roper Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 263</cite>, 75
                        S.E. 800 (1912).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Acts of Deputy Clerks Validated. - At the time, and prior to the enactment of this section, deputy clerks could not take proof of deeds and other instruments requiring registration; but an erroneous impression prevailed then and before that time, that
                        they and the judges of the courts had authority to do so, and in many instances they undertook to exercise such authority. To cure errors in this respect and render effectual many official acts done by honest misapprehension of
                        the law, the legislature enacted this section. Tatom v. White, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. 453</cite> (1886). As to authority of deputy clerks to take probate on instruments, see G.S. 47-1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section validates probates of deeds and privy examinations taken before a deputy clerk prior to January 1, 1889, and it is immaterial whether the deputy clerk, in making the probate, signed as deputy clerk or merely signed the name of the clerk thereto.
                        Gordon v. Collett, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 362</cite>, 12 S.E. 332 (1890).

                    <p>
                        Intentional Breaches of Authority Not Validated. - There was no intent to give efficacy and vitality to a certificate of probate or adjudication of its correctness, where the error consisted not in misconceiving the extent of the power affirmatively conferred
                        by law, but in disregarding a plain prohibition of the statute, and committing a breach of propriety in breaking over the barriers constructed to limit their authority. It was never intended that an officer, who exercised authority
                        in the face of a plain statutory prohibition, should under the curative provisions of this section derive benefit from thus disregarding such legal restrictions for his own advantage or convenience. Freeman v. Person,

                    <p>
                        Probate of Interested Officer. - This section has been considered in Freeman v. Person, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 251</cite>, 10 S.E. 1037 (1890), and it is there held that it cannot be construed to validate the probate of
                        an officer in regard to a matter in which he or his wife was a party. White v. Connelly, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 65</cite>, 11 S.E. 177 (1890).

                    on behalf of the principal mentioned or referred to in the instrument. This section shall not affect any pending litigation or the status of any matter heretofore determined by the courts. This section shall apply to all such instruments
                    heretofore or hereafter executed. Registers of deeds shall be required to index all such instruments filed for registration both in the name of the principal or principals executing the powers of appointment and in the name of the
                    attorney-in-fact executing the instrument: Provided, that instruments heretofore registered and indexed only in the name of the attorney-in-fact shall be valid and in all respects binding upon the principal or principals insofar as
                    validity of registration is concerned.
