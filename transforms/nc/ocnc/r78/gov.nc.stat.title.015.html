    Editor's Note.
   
   - Session Laws 1973, c. 1286, repealed, transferred and amended numerous sections in this Chapter and elsewhere in the General Statutes, largely relating to pretrial procedure, and enacted a new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 15A</a></cite>, the Criminal Procedure Act.
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 1973, c. 1286, ss. 27, 28, and 31, provided: "Sec. 27. All statutes which refer to sections repealed or amended by this act shall be deemed, insofar as possible, to refer to those provisions of this act which accomplish the same or an equivalent purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Sec. 28. None of the provisions of this act providing for the repeal of certain sections of the General Statutes shall constitute a reenactment of the common law.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Sec. 31. This act becomes effective on July 1, 1975, and is applicable to all criminal proceedings begun on and after that date and each provision is applicable to criminal proceedings pending on that date to the extent practicable, except G.S. 12 [G.S. 15-176.3 through 15-176.5] of this act which becomes effective on July 1, 1974."
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 1975, c. 573, amended Session Laws 1973, c. 1286, s. 31, so as to make the provisions of the act that were to become effective on July 1, 1975 effective Sept. 1, 1975.

        Section Not Repealed.
   
   - There is no stated purpose in G.S. 15A-641 that indicates the legislature intended to repeal this section. Furthermore, G.S. 15A-641 appears to be an effort by the legislature to codify the common law that permitted the use of presentments by grand juries but prohibited the arrest and trial of defendants on a presentment. Thus, this section has not been repealed and remains a part of the law of this State; it would support the order of the trial court denying defendant's motion to dismiss. State v. Whittle, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 130, 454 S.E.2d 688 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Statute on Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.
   
   - A witness cannot invoke the privilege against self-incrimination where he is either immune from prosecution, or where prosecution is barred by statute of limitations. Leonard v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 512, 397 S.E.2d 321 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A legal limitation of time of prosecution is in practical effect expurgation of crime; so after the lapse of time fixed by law, the privilege against self-incrimination ceases. Leonard v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 512, 397 S.E.2d 321 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Meaning of "Deceit".
   
   - There has never been such an indictable offense as "deceit" but the meaning of this section has always been that misdemeanors, the gist of which was a malice or deceit, were within the exception of the section as formerly appearing. State v. Crowell, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 1052</cite>, 21 S.E. 502 (1895).
       </p>

        There being no such offense as "deceit," this term would apply to "cheating by false token" of which deceit was the gist but would not include "conspiracy to cheat" the gist of which offense is the conspiracy and the cheating but an aggravation. "Deceit" is not restricted to "cheating by false token". It is an instance of an offense coming within the general description of misdemeanors by deceit. State v. Christiansbury, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. 46</cite> (1852); State v. Crowell, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 1052</cite>, 21 S.E. 502 (1895).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Meaning of "Malicious Misdemeanors".
   
   - When, in the former wording of this section, the Legislature used the words "other malicious misdemeanors," which immediately followed the words "malicious mischief," it evidently intended to describe offenses of which malice was a necessary ingredient to constitute the criminal act, as in the case of malicious mischief. It was not the purpose to include within the exception from the operation of this section such offenses as would be misdemeanors, even in the absence of malice, and when malice, if present, would be only a circumstance of aggravation, which the court might consider in imposing the punishment. State v. Frisbee, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 671</cite>, 55 S.E. 722 (1906).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        What Constitutes a Presentment.
   
   - See State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 537</cite>, 10 S.E. 454 (1889).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute Tolled on Date of Indictment or Presentment.
   
   - In criminal cases where an indictment or presentment is required, the date on which the indictment or presentment has been brought or found by the grand jury marks the beginning of the criminal proceeding and arrests the statute of limitations. State v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 68</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 461 (1956); State v. Hundley, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 491</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 582 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The indictment marks the beginning of the prosecution and it arrests the running of the statute of limitations. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 660</cite>, 65 S.E. 908 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecution for alleged commission of misdemeanor death by motor vehicle offenses, based on an indictment in Superior Court of North Carolina, was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations because the statute of limitations was tolled by the grand jury returning a presentment and subsequent indictment in an active case in the District Court of North Carolina. State v. Stevens, - N.C. App.
   - , 831 S.E.2d 364 (2019), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 583</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 892, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 129 (N.C. 2020).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Even If Defendant Is Apprehended and Tried More Than Two Years After Offense.
   
   - An indictment or presentment marks the beginning of the prosecution so as to toll the statute of limitations, even though defendant be apprehended and tried more than two years after the offense was committed. State v. Best, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 62, 177 S.E.2d 772 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Issuance of Citation Tolled Statute of Limitations.
   
   - It was error to affirm a decision upholding an order granting defendant's motion to dismiss because a citation issued for driving while subject to an impairing substance tolled the statute of limitations, and the citation was a constitutionally and statutorily proper criminal pleading that conveyed jurisdiction to the district court to try defendant; because a citation could serve as the charging document for misdemeanors, the purpose of the statute of limitations was satisfied by its issuance. State v. Curtis, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 355</cite>, 817 S.E.2d 187 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Statute Tolled on Appeal to Superior Court.
   
   - In all misdemeanor cases, where there has been a conviction in an inferior court that had final jurisdiction of the offense charged, upon appeal to the superior court the accused may be tried upon the original warrant and the statute of limitations is tolled from the date of the issuance of the warrant. State v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 68</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 461 (1956); State v. Hundley, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 491</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 582 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Entry of Nolle Prosequi "With Leave."
   
   - This section does not begin to run from an entry of nolle prosequi "with leave." State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 660</cite>, 65 S.E. 908 (1909).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Preliminary Warrants.
   
   - There is no saving clause in this section as to the effect of preliminary warrants before a justice of the peace or other committing magistrate, and the law must be construed and applied as written. There must be a presentment or indictment within two years from the time of the offense committed and not afterwards. State v. Hedden, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 803</cite>, 123 S.E. 65 (1924).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Void Warrant Does Not Toll Statute.
   
   - The issuance of a void warrant in a misdemeanor prosecution does not toll the running of this section, and where on appeal from a conviction upon such warrant in an inferior court defendant is tried upon an identical indictment returned by the grand jury more than two years after the commission of the offense, he is entitled to quashal of the indictment. State v. Hundley, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 491</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 582 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defective Indictments Exception Not Applicable to Warrants.
   
   - The statute of limitations had run as a result of the defendant being charged with a fatally defective warrant; although defective indictments may be refiled within one year of dismissal, no such exception exists for defective warrants. State v. Madry, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 537 S.E.2d 827 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial on Second Bill After Two Years Barred.
   
   - Even an indictment within the statutory time limit will not uphold a trial and conviction on a second bill found after the statutory period. State v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. 32</cite> (1842); State v. Hedden, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 803</cite>, 123 S.E. 65 (1924).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No statute of limitation bars the prosecution of a felony.
   
   State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 264</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 274 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a warrant charging a misdemeanor is amended to charge a felony,
   
   defendant's plea of the statute of limitations on the misdemeanor count becomes immaterial. State v. Sanderson, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 381</cite>, 196 S.E. 324 (1938).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Necessity for Pleading Statute.
   
   - For a person charged with the commission of a criminal offense to avail himself of the alleged running of the statute of limitations, he must either specifically plead it or in apt time bring it to the attention of the court. State v. Brinkley, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 747</cite>, 138 S.E. 138 (1927).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute Not Presumed to Have Run.
   
   - Upon a trial on indictment for the sale of intoxicants where there was evidence of sales at undisclosed times, it would not be presumed that such sales occurred more than two years next preceding the prosecution when defendant has not pleaded this section, or in apt time called it to the court's attention or offered evidence as to the dates of sale. State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 28</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 808 (1942).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury is not restricted to the time stated in the indictment,
   
   but is at liberty, as directed by the trial judge, to consider acts charged and proved within the two years next before the finding of the indictment. State v. Newsome, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. 173</cite> (1855).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Wrong Name in Bill of Indictment.
   
   - A bill of indictment against a person by a wrong name, which is pleaded to in abatement, and the plea found, is, nevertheless, the same cause of action, and the elapse of two years is no bar to prosecution. State v. Hailey, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. 42</cite> (1858).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Dismissal Proper.
   
   - Trial court did not err in dismissing a misdemeanor driving while impaired charge against defendant because prosecution was barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations where the issuance of a citation did not toll the statute of limitations and the State failed to either commence the prosecution of its case or to issue a warrant, indictment, or presentment that would toll the statute of limitations. State v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 776, 793 S.E.2d 287 (2016), review denied, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 305 (2017).

   is subject to two-year statute of limitations. Leonard v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 512, 397 S.E.2d 321 (1990).

        Bastardy proceedings
   
   are not governed by this section. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 1043</cite>, 30 S.E. 139 (1898).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conspiracy.
   
   - The section has no application to conspiracy, which is a felony. State v. Mallett, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 718</cite>, 34 S.E. 651 (1899), aff'd, 181 U.S. 589, 21 S. Ct. 730, 45 L. Ed. 1015 (1901).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Each Overt Act of Conspiracy Tolls Statute.
   
   - A conspiracy is a continuing offense so that the statute of limitations is tolled as to the original conspiracy each time an overt act is committed in furtherance of the purpose and design of the conspiracy. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 533</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 262, appeal dismissed, 375 U.S. 9, 84 S. Ct. 72, 11 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a count and the indictment alleged that a conspiracy continued from time to time with the commission of overt acts by the alleged conspirators in furtherance of conspiracy and to effectuate its unlawful purpose within two years of the finding of the indictment, the trial court correctly overruled defendants' motion to quash the first count in the indictment on the ground that a prosecution on such count was barred by this section. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 533</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 262, appeal dismissed, 375 U.S. 9, 84 S. Ct. 72, 11 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor
   
   is a misdemeanor. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 533</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 262, appeal dismissed, 375 U.S. 9, 84 S. Ct. 72, 11 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Influencing Agents and Servants.
   
   - Violation of G.S. 14-353, which makes it a crime to influence agents and servants to violate duties owed employers, is not a malicious misdemeanor. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 533</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 262, appeal dismissed, 375 U.S. 9, 84 S. Ct. 72, 11 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Nuisances.
   
   - No length of possession can bar an action to abate a public nuisance. State v. Holman, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 861</cite>, 10 S.E. 758 (1889).

       Place of Imprisonment Where Sentence Is Less Than or Greater Than 180 Days.

      - Absent specific statutory authorization (see, e.g., G.S. 15A-711, 148-32.1, 162-38 to 162-40), imprisonment of misdemeanants with sentences of 180 days or less must be in the local confinement facility of the county where the crime was committed. If the sentence is greater than 180 days, commitment may be either to such a local facility or to the N.C. Department of Correction. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Bruce E.

      - While G.S. 15-6 applies to both felons and misdemeanants, G.S. 15A-1352 overrides G.S. 15-6 to the extent it provides for certain felons and misdemeanants to be sentenced to terms of imprisonment under the jurisdiction of the N.C.

       Effect of G.S. 15A-1352 on Section.
      </b>
      - G.S. 15A-1352 is an exception to G.S. 15-6 as to those misdemeanants with sentences of more than 180 days, because they may be sentenced to serve their term of imprisonment under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction, but as to those not placed in the custody of the Department of Correction, the only effect of G.S. 15A-1352 is to broaden the term "common jail" to include other types of local facilities which may be used under appropriate circumstances.

      In all cases where a defendant has been convicted in a court inferior to the superior court and sentenced to a term in the county jail or to serve in some county institution other than under the supervision of the State Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety, and such defendant is subsequently brought before such court for an offense committed prior to the expiration of the term to be served in such county institution, upon conviction, plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the judge shall have the power and authority to change the place of confinement of the prisoner and commit such defendant to work under the supervision of the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety. This provision shall apply whether or not the terms of the new sentence are to run concurrently with or consecutive to the remaining portion of the old sentence.

       This section merely provides that under certain circumstances a defendant who has not been speedily tried shall be released from custody. It does not require that the prosecution against him be dismissed. State v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 201 S.E.2d 74 (1973).

       In a case where the court has ordered that defendant's trial must begin within a certain time period or he must be discharged, failure to try defendant within that time period, absent determination that defendant has been deprived of a speedy trial, results only in release of defendant from custody, but not dismissal of charges against him.

       "Speedy" cannot be defined in specific terms

      <p>
       But Four Factors Are Considered in Determining Whether Denial of Speedy Trial Is Unconstitutional.
   
   - The four generally accepted interrelated factors to be considered together in reaching a determination of whether the denial of a speedy trial assumes due process proportions are the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the prejudice to the defendant, and waiver by defendant. State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 197 S.E.2d 54, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 758</cite>, 198 S.E.2d 728 (1973); State v.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether Right Denied Is Determined in Circumstances of Each Case.
   
   - Whether defendant has been denied the right to a speedy trial is a matter to be determined by the trial judge in the circumstances of each case. State v. Setzer, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 204 S.E.2d 921 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Balancing Test.
   
   - A claim that a defendant has been denied his right to a speedy trial is subject to a balancing test in which the conduct of both the prosecutor and defendant are weighed. State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 197 S.E.2d 54 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Convict in Penitentiary for Unrelated Crime Not Excepted from Guarantee.
   
   - A convict, confined in the penitentiary for an unrelated crime, is not excepted from the constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial of any other charges pending against him. State v. O'Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 368</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 672 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden is on an accused
   
   who asserts denial of his right to a speedy trial to show that the delay was due to the neglect or willfulness of the prosecution. State v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 203 S.E.2d 395, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 751</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 646 (1974).

      <p>
       Purpose of Section.
   
   - The primary purpose of this section is to provide a prisoner with a means by which he may require the State to try all the criminal charges against him to the end that he and the authorities may know the full extent of his debt to society for his criminal activities and that he may plan for his release when the debt has been satisfied. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 78</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 774 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Detainer.
   
   - The presence of a detainer in a prisoner's file jeopardizes his chances for parole, proper good behavior credits and work release. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 78</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 774 (1967); Farrington v. North Carolina, 391 F. Supp. 714 (M.D.N.C. 1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Compliance with Section Is Required.
   
   - A defendant cannot claim the benefits afforded by this section without complying with its terms. State v. McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 134</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 383 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant did not follow the requirements of this section by making his demand upon the solicitor (now district attorney) by registered mail, but instead he sent a letter to the clerk of the superior court and the solicitor (now district attorney) did not receive the notice, the defendant is not entitled to his release for failure of the State to bring him to trial within eight months. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 78</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 774 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       An inmate must follow the section's requirements. He must send by registered mail a demand to the district attorney, and sending it to the clerk of the superior court unregistered is insufficient, when the district attorney does not know of the demand. Farrington v. North Carolina, 391 F. Supp. 714 (M.D.N.C. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       And Failure to Comply Deprives Prisoner of Its Benefit.
   
   - Failure to send the motion by registered mail to the district attorney of the judicial district in which the charges are pending will deprive defendant of the benefit of this section. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 45</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 624 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1049, 97 S. Ct. 760, 50 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's letter requesting a speedy trial did not comply with the provisions of this section where, for example, he failed to send the letter by registered mail to the district attorney; he failed to give notice of his place of confinement; and he failed to include a certificate from the Secretary of Correction. Having failed to follow the provisions of the statute, defendant was not entitled to the statutory relief. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 221 S.E.2d 751, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 45</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 624 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1049, 97 S. Ct. 760, 50 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Oral requests for trial made by defendant's counsel to the district attorney were not sufficient
   
   to entitle defendant to a dismissal under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. State v. McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 304, 235 S.E.2d 98, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 134</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 383 (1978).

       If a law-enforcement officer seizes property pursuant to lawful authority, he shall safely keep the property under the direction of the court or magistrate as long as necessary to assure that the property will be produced at and may be used as evidence in any trial. Upon application by the lawful owner or a person, firm or corporation entitled to possession or upon his own determination, the district attorney may release any property seized pursuant to his lawful authority if he determines that such property is no longer useful or necessary as evidence in a criminal trial and he is presented with satisfactory evidence of ownership. If the district attorney refuses to release such property, the lawful owner or a person, firm or corporation entitled to possession may make application to the court for return of the property. The court, after notice to all parties, including the defendant, and after hearing, may in its discretion order any or all of the property returned to the lawful owner or a person, firm or corporation entitled to possession. The court may enter such order as may be necessary to assure that the evidence will be available for use as evidence at the time of trial, and will otherwise protect the rights of all parties. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, photographs or other identification or analyses made of the property may be introduced at the time of the trial provided that the court determines that the introduction of such substitute evidence is not likely to substantially prejudice the rights of the defendant in the criminal trial.

The judicial findings concerning identification or value that are made at such hearing whereby property is returned to the lawful owner or a person, firm, or corporation entitled to possession, may be admissible into evidence at the trial. After final judgment all property lawfully seized by or otherwise coming into the possession of law-enforcement authorities shall be disposed of as the court or magistrate in its discretion orders, and may be forfeited and either sold or destroyed in accordance with due process of law.

       When the State destroyed a knife that was involved in defendant's alleged crimes after defendant's convictions were affirmed, defendant's due process rights were not violated because (1) defendant never claimed the evidence was destroyed in bad faith, and, (2) despite the knife's unavailability, defense counsel was able to elicit impeaching testimony from the State's witnesses concerning the knife.

       Seizure of Currency.
   
   - Where law enforcement seized currency as potential evidence, once the district attorney determined that the evidence was not needed at trial, he had complete control to release the property to the lawful owner or to another entitled to possession without a court order; the district attorney's failure to designate the property as needed evidence or act in any way to deny release of the proceeds, established conclusively that the district attorney permitted release of the proceeds to the Department of Revenue under subsection (a).

       Order to Destroy Firearms Held Improper.
   
   - When an officer testified that defendant admitted that he and his wife used marijuana about every other day, that statement was hearsay as to defendant's wife, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 801(c), and could not be used as the basis for the trial court's finding that she was an unlawful user of controlled substances; thus, the trial court's order directing the destruction of her firearms, under G.S. 15-11.1(b1), based on this finding, was an abuse of discretion, because the wife was given no opportunity to contest the statement, nor was she represented by counsel at the time the testimony containing it was received.

       Failure to Show State's Bad Faith.
   
   - In a case in which defendant was convicted by a jury on two counts first-degree murder on the bases of felony murder and of malice, premeditation and deliberation and, after a capital sentencing proceeding, he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, defendant argued unsuccessfully on appeal that the trial erred in allowing testimony about his car when it was lost before trial. While defendant moved for sanctions pursuant to G.S. 15-11.1 and G.S. 15A-903, seeking to bar admission of the State's forensic evidence from the car, he had not shown bad faith on the part of the State in losing the car, and he was able to test the soil samples collected from the car and present exculpatory evidence at trial to rebut the State's evidence, as well as to impeach the police department's credibility and competence.

        Opinions of Attorney General
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If money or property is not seized as evidence of a controlled substance law violation, agents of the Department of Revenue may seize it for satisfaction of controlled substance excise taxes without an order from the court having jurisdiction over the criminal offense and without the district attorney's consent provided the seizure otherwise is made in compliance with law. See opinion of Attorney General to Secretary Janice H. Faulkner, 1994 N.C.A.G. 2 (July 19, 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of a pre-existing valid court order directing that property seized pursuant to a search warrant or other lawful authority be retained by the court or delivered to another court, a law-enforcement agency in possession of the property is not required to obtain a court order prior to releasing it. See opinion of Attorney General to Secretary Janice H. Faulkner, 1994 N.C.A.G. 2 (July 19, 1994).

     <p>
      Any criminal warrant may be amended in the superior court, before or during the trial, when there shall appear to be any variance between the allegations in the warrant and the evidence in setting forth the ownership of property if, in the opinion of the court, such amendment will not prejudice the defendant.

   - Appellate court erred in vacating defendant's convictions for, inter alia, misdemeanor larceny and misdemeanor injury to personal property because the prosecutor's motion to amend the arrest warrant - by filing a statement of charges form after arraignment - to correctly state the name of the property owner was statutorily authorized, the superior court properly considered and allowed the change and rightly proceeded to try defendant for the charges with the corrected name of the property owner.

       Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 11 of Chapter 15A, any official or employee of the State or of a unit of county or local government of North Carolina may, under the conditions specified in this section, obtain a warrant authorizing him to conduct a search or inspection of property if such a search or inspection is one that is elsewhere authorized by law, either with or without the consent of the person whose privacy would be thereby invaded, and is one for which such a warrant is constitutionally required.
      </li>

       The warrant may be issued by any magistrate of the general court of justice, judge, clerk, or assistant or deputy clerk of any court of record whose territorial jurisdiction encompasses the property to be inspected.

         The one seeking the warrant must establish under oath or affirmation that the property to be searched or inspected is to be searched or inspected as part of a legally authorized program of inspection which naturally includes that property, or that there is probable cause for believing that there is a condition, object, activity or circumstance which legally justifies such a search or inspection of that property;
        </li>

         An affidavit indicating the basis for the establishment of one of the grounds described in (1) above must be signed under oath or affirmation by the affiant;

         It must describe, either directly or by reference to the affidavit, the property where the search or inspection is to occur and be accurate enough in description so that the executor of the warrant and the owner or the possessor of the property can reasonably determine from it what person or property the warrant authorizes an inspection of;

If the warrant, however, was procured pursuant to an investigation authorized by G.S. 58-79-1, the warrant may be executed at any hour, is valid for 48 hours after its issuance, and must be returned without unnecessary delay after its execution or after the expiration of the 48 hour period if it is not executed. If the owner or possessor of the property is not present on the property at the time of the search or inspection and reasonable efforts to locate the owner or possessor have been made and have failed, the warrant or a copy thereof may be affixed to the property and shall have the same effect as if served personally upon the owner or possessor.

       Alternative Criteria for Basis of Warrant.
   
   - Subdivision (c)(1) of this section creates two alternative criteria for determining whether to issue a warrant. The first, the "program of inspection test," is that the property is to be inspected as part of a legally authorized program of inspection which naturally includes that property. The second is a probable cause test. If an inspection meets either of these tests a warrant is properly issued under the statute. Gooden v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 251 S.E.2d 698, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 806</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 919 (1979), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1097, 102 S. Ct. 670, 70 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subdivision (c)(1) of this section, one of the following two conditions must be met before an administrative search warrant can be issued: First, the property to be searched or inspected must be searched or inspected as part of a "legally authorized program of inspection which naturally includes that property"; or second, there must be "probable cause for believing that there is a condition, object, activity or circumstance that legally justifies such a search or inspection of that property."

       Warrant Protects Rights Under U.S. Const., Amend.
   
   IV. - A warrant showing that a specific business has been chosen for an Occupational Safety and Health Act search on the basis of a general administrative plan for the enforcement of the act derived from neutral sources such as, for example, dispersion of employees in various types of industries across a given area, and the desired frequency of searches in any of the lesser divisions of the area, would protect an employer's rights under U.S. Const., Amend IV. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory scheme for obtaining a warrant to conduct an administrative inspection, when complied with, provides ample protections against the constitutional proscription of general warrants. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).

      <p>
       Corporations have never possessed the kind of protection under U.S. Const., Amend. IV accorded to persons and their homes.
   
   Corporations' special status as creatures of the state exposes them to exhaustive state scrutiny in exchange for the privilege of state recognition. In re Superior Court Order Dated April 8, 1983, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 318 S.E.2d 843, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 378</cite>, 338 S.E.2d 307 (1986).

      </p>
      <p>
       Probable Cause Standards Under Section Are Sufficient.
   
   - While subdivision (c)(1) of this section sets forth standards for issuance of an administrative search warrant which are less stringent than the probable cause standards required in the criminal law sense under G.S. 15A-246, these standards are certainly sufficient to guarantee that a decision to search private property is justified by a reasonable governmental interest. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979), but see Gooden v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 251 S.E.2d 698, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 806</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 919 (1979), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1097, 102 S. Ct. 670, 70 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement of subdivision (c)(1) of this section that property is to be inspected as part of a legally authorized program of inspection which naturally includes that property comports with the criterion that a specific property has been chosen for a search on the basis of a general administrative plan for the enforcement of the act derived from neutral sources. The statute must be interpreted as also requiring a showing to the magistrate that the general administrative plan for enforcement is based upon "reasonable legislative or administrative standards." Interpreted in this way, subdivision (c)(1) of this section requires a sufficient showing of probable cause and is constitutional. Gooden v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 251 S.E.2d 698, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 806</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 919 (1979), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1097, 102 S. Ct. 670, 70 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Basis for Probable Cause.
   
   - For purposes of an administrative search, probable cause justifying the issuance of a warrant may be based not only on specific evidence of an existing violation but also on a showing that reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular establishment. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probable cause for an administration inspection warrant may be based on (1) specific evidence of an existing violation, or (2) a showing that reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular establishment. In order to meet the requirements of the second standard, an applicant for an inspection warrant must show that: (1) there exists a legally authorized inspection program which naturally included the property; (2) that the general administrative enforcement plan is based on reasonable legislative or administrative standards; and (3) that the administrative standards are being applied to the particular establishment on a neutral basis. Brooks v. Butler, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 681, 321 S.E.2d 440 (1984), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 327</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 385 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Probable Cause Where Not Part of Program of Inspection.
   
   - A warrant to conduct an inspection that is not part of a program of inspection may issue upon a showing of probable cause, the standard for which is the same as in the case of a search warrant in a criminal proceeding. State v. Sheetz, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 641, 265 S.E.2d 914 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Requirements for warrant procedures set out in State v. Campbell,
   
   <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 125</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 752 (1972), a criminal case, apply equally to the issuance of administrative inspection warrants, since the purpose of a warrant in either case is to provide for a determination of probable cause by a neutral officer. Gooden v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 251 S.E.2d 698, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 806</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 919 (1979), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1097, 102 S. Ct. 670, 70 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1981), but see Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Neutral Application of Inspection Program Required.
   
   - It is necessary for the agency to make a showing to the magistrate, or clerk, that the general administrative plan for enforcement is being applied on a neutral basis as to the particular establishment to be inspected. Gooden v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 251 S.E.2d 698, appeal dismissed, denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 806</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 919 (1979), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1097, 102 S. Ct. 670, 70 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Scope and Objects of Search Must Be Included in Warrant.
   
   - Unless an administrative inspection warrant advises the owner or possessor of the property proposed to be searched of the scope and objects of the search, beyond which limits the inspector may not go, it does not meet the requirements of subdivision (d)(3) of this section. In short, a valid search warrant serves not only to authorize a search of premises but also to afford reasonable notice to the possessor of property of the nature and extent of any search that is to be conducted. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       A warrant authorizing inspection of all pertinent conditions, structures, machines, apparatus, devices, equipment, and materials, and all other things is not overbroad. A warrant authorizing a general inspection of an industry naturally contemplates a comprehensive inspection since the location of possible violations is unknown. Brooks v. Butler, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 681, 321 S.E.2d 440 (1984), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 327</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 385 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Warrant Improperly Granted.
   
   - Where there was no showing from which a magistrate could have independently determined (1) that there existed a legally authorized program of inspection which naturally included the property, (2) that the general administrative plan for enforcement was based upon reasonable legislative or administrative standards, and (3) that the administrative standards were being applied to plaintiff on a neutral basis, the warrant was improperly granted. Gooden v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 251 S.E.2d 698, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 806</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 919 (1979), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1097, 102 S. Ct. 670, 70 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1981).

       The allegation that agents have conducted an investigation which has disclosed evidence of irregularities which, if supported by evidence and found to be true, would constitute serious violations of the law on the part of the defendant, without the disclosure of facts from which the magistrate could ascertain the existence of irregularities that would constitute serious violations of the law, does not meet the constitutional standard for issuance of a search warrant. State v. Sheetz, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 641, 265 S.E.2d 914 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficiency of Warrant Determined from Affidavits.
   
   - The rule that the sufficiency of a search warrant should properly be determined with reference to the supporting affidavits is applicable in the context of administrative inspection warrants. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Warrant Must Expressly Incorporate Supporting Affidavit.
   
   - If the warrant and the affidavit are to be construed together to provide sufficient proof of authority and notice of the extent of the proposed search, there must be an express reference to the affidavit in the warrant which is sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice of its incorporation. It is not enough that a warrant and its supporting affidavit be served together as a unit for the affidavit to serve to uphold the validity of the warrant. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficiency of Affidavit.
   
   - The "program of inspection" test under subdivision (c)(1) of this section requires the agent seeking the warrant to provide facts in an affidavit showing that a particular business has been selected for inspection pursuant to an administrative plan containing specific neutral criteria. The affidavit to support issuance of a warrant under this standard must contain an adequate description of the general administrative plan, the specific neutral criteria used to determine which businesses will be inspected under the plan, and facts showing why the particular business sought to be inspected comes within the plan. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Inclusion of underlying facts in the affidavit is necessary
   
   to make the warrant procedure meaningful. Gooden v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 251 S.E.2d 698, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 806</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 919 (1979), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1097, 102 S. Ct. 670, 70 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       And Affidavit Insufficient Where Facts Not Included.
   
   - Where no facts from which the issuing officer could determine whether probable cause existed were included in the affidavit on which the administrative warrant was obtained, the affidavit was insufficient to support the issuance of an administrative search warrant. Gooden v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 251 S.E.2d 698, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 806</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 919 (1979), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1097, 102 S. Ct. 670, 70 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusory allegations by the affiant,
   
   which are nothing more than a perfunctory restatement of the statutory language contained in subdivision (c)(1) of this section, are insufficient to meet the statutory requirements. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Specific Evidence of OSHA Violation Is Sufficient.
   
   - The "probable cause" standard permits an Occupational Safety and Health Act agent to obtain a warrant where he has specific evidence in an affidavit showing that conditions in violation of OSHA exist on the premises. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       But Not Necessary.
   
   - An Occupational Safety and Health Act agent's entitlement to inspect will not depend on his demonstrating probable cause to believe that conditions in violation of OSHA exist on the premises. Probable cause in the criminal law sense is not required. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statistical Likelihood of OSHA Violation Is Not Sufficient.
   
   - The attempt to show through statistics that an inspection of the business would be likely to reveal Occupational Safety and Health Act violations is not sufficient to meet the "probable cause" test under the statute. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
   <br />

       Inspection of Corporate Records in Fraud Investigation.
   
   - An ex parte order from the superior court, directing officials of a certain corporation to make available the records pertaining to its transactions with two other corporations and with City of Charlotte, incident to an investigation into possible fraud and irregularities in the purchasing of parts, equipment and services by the city, was not an administrative search warrant to which the strictness of U.S. Const., Amend.

   20, and this section would apply. Where such order was neither unreasonably broad nor indefinite, its issuance would be affirmed. In re Computer Technology Corp., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 337 S.E.2d 165 (1985).

   - Where the defendant while in this State shot across the State line and killed a person in Tennessee, he could not be found guilty of murder absent a statute expressly conferring jurisdiction upon the courts of this State, or making the act of shooting under the circumstances a substantive murder. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 909</cite>, 19 S.E. 602 (1894), decided prior to enactment of this section.

     <p>
      In indictments for murder and manslaughter, it is not necessary to allege matter not required to be proved on the trial; but in the body of the indictment, after naming the person accused, and the county of his residence, the date of the offense, the averment "with force and arms," and the county of the alleged commission of the offense, as is now usual, it is sufficient in describing murder to allege that the accused person feloniously, willfully, and of his malice aforethought, did kill and murder (naming the person killed), and concluding as is now required by law; and it is sufficient in describing manslaughter to allege that the accused feloniously and willfully did kill and slay (naming the person killed), and concluding as aforesaid; and any bill of indictment containing the averments and allegations herein named shall be good and sufficient in law as an indictment for murder or manslaughter, as the case may be.

       <p>
        Short-Form Indictment Sufficient to Charge Attempted First-Degree Murder.
   
   - Short-form indictment was sufficient to vest the trial court with subject-matter jurisdiction over the attempted first-degree murder charge because the prosecution properly included the legal element of malice aforethought; and, despite the usage of the term "slay" instead of the term "murder," the short-form indictment provided such certainty in the statement of the accusation as would identify the offense with which defendant was charged. State v. Tart, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 73</cite>, 824 S.E.2d 837 (2019).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Short-Form Murder Indictment Complied with Statutory Requirements.
   
   - Short-form murder indictment did not violate defendant's constitutional rights as it complied with the requirements of G.S. 15-144, for a short-form murder indictment because the indictment contained the language that defendant unlawfully, willfully and feloniously and with malice aforethought killed the victim. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 565 S.E.2d 697 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court of North Carolina has consistently held that the short-form indictment is sufficient to charge a defendant with first-degree murder. The short-form murder indictment authorized by G.S. 15-144 gives a defendant notice that he is charged with first-degree murder and that the maximum penalty to which he could be subject is death. State v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 587 S.E.2d 889 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss, with respect to a first-degree murder charge against him based on an underlying felony of attempted rape, as the short-form indictment that was used to charge him was authorized by G.S.15-144, and accordingly, there was no constitutional infirmity; murder indictments that comply with G.S. 15-144 are sufficient to charge first-degree murder on the basis of any theory set forth in G.S. 14-17, which included the charge against defendant. State v. Garcia, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 382</cite>, 597 S.E.2d 724 (2004), cert. denied, - U.S.
   - , 125 S. Ct. 1301, 161 L. Ed. 2d 122 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeals court upheld the use of a short form murder indictment under G.S. 15-144 which stated that: The jurors for North Carolina upon their oath present that on or about the (the date was stated) in (the county was stated). (the defendant's name was stated) did unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously and of malice aforethought kill and murder (the victim's name was stated). State v. McClain, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 610 S.E.2d 783 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Short-form indictment in the capital murder case met the requirements of G.S. 15-144. State v. Duke, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 110</cite>, 623 S.E.2d 11 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's attempt to have conviction for attempted first-degree murder vacated based on his claim that the use of a short-form indictment for the crime of attempted murder was not authorized in North Carolina was without merit; G.S. 15-144, when construed with G.S. 15-170, authorized use of a short-form indictment to charge attempted first-degree murder, and the indictment sufficiently alleged the offense of attempted first-degree murder using the statutory language. State v. McVay, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 335, 620 S.E.2d 883 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant had no right to a reversal in his murder trial, despite his claim that the indictment was insufficient for staying only that he violated G.S. 14-17. The indictment the requirements of G.S. 15-144. State v. Elliott, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 400</cite>, 628 S.E.2d 735 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prisoner's short-form murder indictment provided constitutionally adequate notice because it cited to both the statute authorizing the short-form, pursuant to G.S. 15-144, and to the state's murder statute, pursuant to G.S. 14-17, thus notifying the prisoner that he needed to defend against a charge of first degree murder on any or all grounds, including murder by torture. Stroud v. Polk, 466 F.3d 291 (4th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 551 U.S. 1134, 127 S. Ct. 2978, 168 L. Ed. 2d 709 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of the short-form indictment for first-degree murder met the requirements of G.S. 15-144. State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 673 S.E.2d 724 (2009), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 815</cite>, 689 S.E.2d 859, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 195 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by refusing defendant's request to require the State of North Carolina to disclose its felony murder theory before the jury was empaneled because, although the State used a short-form indictment to charge defendant with murder, the indictment was sufficient and the State's legal theories were not factual information subject to inclusion in a bill of particulars. Moreover, defendant failed to establish that defendant could not adequately prepare a defense without knowledge of the State's legal theory. State v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 345, 772 S.E.2d 486 (2015).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's murder indictment complied with the requirements of this section and did not violate his constitutional rights.
   
   State v. Holman, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 174</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 18 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 910, 122 S. Ct. 250, 151 L. Ed. 2d 181 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 854</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 854 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court rejected the defendant's contention that the use of the short-form murder indictments authorized by this section did not give him sufficient notice and violated his rights to due process, notice, fundamental fairness, and trial by jury. State v. Lytch, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 544 S.E.2d 570 (2001), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 270</cite>, 559 S.E.2d 547 (2002).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment in form prescribed by this section is sufficient.
   
   State v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 412</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 65 (1972).
       </p>

        An indictment which complies with the short form indictment authorized by this section is sufficient to charge first degree murder without specifically alleging premeditation and deliberation or felony murder. State v. Avery, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 1</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 786 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 572, 383 S.E.2d 224 (1989).

        Short-form murder indictment was constitutionally sufficient to charge the defendant with first-degree murder. State v. Brewington, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 489</cite>, 532 S.E.2d 496 (2000), cert denied, 531 U.S. 1165, 121 S. Ct. 1126, 148 L. Ed. 2d 992 (2001).

       <p>
        The murder indictment which complied with G.S. 15-144 was sufficient and did not violate the defendant's due process and equal protection rights under the United States Constitution. State v. Barnett, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 378, 540 S.E.2d 423 (2000), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 527</cite>, 549 S.E.2d 552 (2001).

        Defendant was appropriately charged in a short form bill of indictment in accordance with this section. State v. Washington, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 544 S.E.2d 249 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Short-form indictment expressly alleging murder in the first-degree met the requirements of G.S. 15-144. State v. Maske, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 40</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 521 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Short-form murder indictment under G.S. 15-144 was sufficient to allege first-degree murder under theories of both premeditation and deliberation and felony murder. State v. Kaher Maruf Muhammad, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 651 S.E.2d 569 (2007), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 242</cite>, 660 S.E.2d 537 (2008).

       <p>
        Defendant's "short-form" first degree murder indictment complied with the state and federal Constitutions
   
   although it failed to charge in the indictment the elements of the crime or aggravating circumstances as "facts (other than prior conviction) that increase the maximum penalty for [the] crime." State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 531</cite>, 532 S.E.2d 773 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 949, 121 S. Ct. 1419, 149 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2001).

        Short form indictment was sufficient to charge defendant with first-degree murder. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 587, 592 S.E.2d 31 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by trying defendant under the short form bills of indictment issued in a two count first-degree murder case because the indictment provided the defendant with sufficient notice of the charges against him. State v. Squires, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 529</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 837 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1088, 124 S. Ct. 2818, 159 L. Ed. 2d 252 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Short-form indictment authorized by G.S. 15-144 was sufficient under both state and federal constitutional standards to support a conviction of first degree murder; there was no merit in defendant's argument that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the first degree murder indictment against him because it did not specifically allege the elements of premeditation and deliberation. State v. Gladden, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 548, 608 S.E.2d 93 (2005), appeal dismissed, cert. denied, - N.C.

       <p>
        Use of a short-form indictment under G.S. 15-144 to charge defendant with first -degree murder complied with the North Carolina and United States Constitutions. State v.

       <p>
        Bill of Particulars.
   
   - If a defendant is charged with murder in the first degree by bill of indictment drawn under this section, and desires to know whether the State relies on proof the killing was done with premeditation and deliberation, or in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate a felony, he should apply for a bill of particulars. State v. Haynes, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 150</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 435 (1970); State v. McLaughlin, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 597</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 238 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3206, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1208 (1976); State v. May, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 644</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 178, reconsideration denied, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 261</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 234, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 928, 98 S. Ct. 414, 54 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under an indictment for murder in the first degree in the usual form under this section, the State is entitled to introduce evidence that defendant committed the homicide in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate a felony, it being incumbent upon defendant if he desires more definite information to request a bill of particulars. State v. Grayson, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 453</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 387 (1954); State v. Scales, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 400</cite>, 87 S.E.2d 916 (1955).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reading to Jury of Indictment Closely Following Section.
   
   - An indictment closely following this section could not have prejudiced defendant by its being read in the presence of the jury, even though it is true that in some instances bills of indictment charging murder will contain the words "premeditation and deliberation," the elements that distinguish murder in the first degree from murder in the second degree. State v. Castor, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 220 S.E.2d 819, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 453</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 161 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Instruction on Lesser Included Homicides Is Required.
   
   - In a felony murder prosecution under an indictment in the form prescribed by this section, evidence that defendant did not commit the underlying felony requires an instruction upon whatever lesser included homicides the indictment and the evidence support. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 583</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 555 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant may always show by the evidence not only his innocence under the theory of prosecution chosen by the State, but also his possible guilt of some lesser offense. If this lesser offense is included in the crime charged in the indictment and if there is evidence to support it, defendant is entitled to have it submitted to the jury. These different theories of defense cannot be abrogated by the State's decision to prosecute, nor the trial court's decision to submit the case on only one prosecutorial theory, when under the indictment and the evidence adduced another is more favorable to defendant. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 583</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 555 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court may not premise a second-degree murder instruction on the possibility
   
   that the jury will accept some of the State's evidence while rejecting other portions of the State's case. State v. Leroux, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 368</cite>, 390 S.E.2d 314, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 871, 111 S. Ct. 192, 112 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment Barred by Collateral Estoppel.
   
   - State's first indictment of defendant charging manslaughter of "a natureless living female fetus . . ." was dismissed for failure to allege a material element of manslaughter, (that is, that defendant did kill another living human being), and State did not appeal; therefore, collateral estoppel barred State's second indictment for manslaughter alleging defendant did "kill and slay a living human being . . .," which referred to the same victim and incident. State v. Parsons, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 175, 374 S.E.2d 123 (1988), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 340</cite>, 378 S.E.2d 805 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Felony Murder or Lying in Wait.
   
   - For all murder cases prosecuted under G.S. 14-17, when there is a conflict in the evidence regarding whether defendant committed the underlying felony or was lying in wait, all lesser degrees of homicide charged in the indictment pursuant to this section and supported by the evidence must be submitted to the jury. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 224</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 8 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction on Second-Degree Murder Where Evidence Shows Lying in Wait.
   
   - The trial court may not give an instruction on second-degree murder when the State's evidence supports a jury finding of each element of lying in wait and when there is no conflict with respect to such evidence. State v. Leroux, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 368</cite>, 390 S.E.2d 314, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 871, 111 S. Ct. 192, 112 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the evidence supports a finding that the murder was perpetrated by means of lying in wait and there is no conflict in the evidence, the trial court is not required to instruct the jury on second-degree murder. State v. Leroux, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 368</cite>, 390 S.E.2d 314, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 871, 111 S. Ct. 192, 112 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1990).

         II. REQUIREMENTS OF INDICTMENT.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section contains no requirement that the indictment specify the degree of murder sought.
   
   State v. King, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 603</cite>, 320 S.E.2d 1 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment must be sufficient in form
   
   to allege murder and support a conviction of murder in the first degree under this section. State v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 181</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 652, death sentence vacated, 409 U.S. 1004, 93 S. Ct. 453, 34 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment Under Section Fully Informs Defendant.
   
   - Where an indictment is drawn according to this section the defendant is given full information of the crime on which he is being tried. State v. Puckett, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 66</cite>, 189 S.E. 183 (1937).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Section Does Not State What Is Necessary.
   
   - This section declares an indictment containing certain words "sufficient," but it does not make those words essential, nor by any reasonable construction can it be held to make technical and "sacramental" words which were not theretofore necessary in indictments for murder. State v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 861</cite>, 11 S.E. 990 (1890).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The indictment satisfied the requirements of this section
   
   where it stated: The jurors for the State upon their oath present that on or about the date of offense shown and in the county named above the defendant named above unlawfully, willfully and feloniously and of malice aforethought did kill and murder [the victim]. State v. Hammonds, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 541 S.E.2d 166 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        First degree murder indictment that stated in part that defendant "unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did. .. of malice aforethought kill and murder Rudolph Hughes. This act was in violation of North Carolina General Statute 14-17," was a valid short form indictment under G.S. 15-144. State v. Hester, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 715 S.E.2d 905 (2011), dismissed and review denied, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 563</cite>, 724 S.E.2d 917, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 271 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment contained all the necessary elements of the offense of second degree murder as a B2 felony because it alleged that defendant unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously and of malice aforethought did kill and murder the victim. State v. Schmieder, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 95, 827 S.E.2d 322 (2019), review dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 711</cite>, 830 S.E.2d 832, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 730 (2019).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment for Murder Need Not Allege All Elements of Crimes Charged.
   
   - Short-form indictments which complied with this section were constitutional although they failed to allege all of the elements of the crimes charged, specifically, those elements which differentiate first-degree murder, rape, and sexual offense from second-degree murder, rape, and sexual offense. State v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 481</cite>, 528 S.E.2d 326, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1018, 121 S. Ct. 581, 148 L. Ed. 2d 498 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant's indictments were valid although they did not allege premeditation, deliberation, and specific intent to kill. State v. Choppy, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 539 S.E.2d 44 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment Need Not Allege That Murder Was Punishable by Death.
   
   - Premeditation and deliberation did not have to be separately alleged in the defendant's short-form indictment which charged him with first-degree murder and, since the death penalty is the prescribed statutory maximum punishment for first-degree murder in North Carolina, no additional facts needed to be charged in the indictment to provide the defendant with notice that he was charged with first-degree murder and that the maximum penalty to which he could be subjected was death. State v. Braxton, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 158</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 428 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1130, 121 S. Ct. 890, 148 L. Ed. 2d 797 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment for murder need not allege deliberation and premeditation.
   
   State v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 412</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 65 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Allege Premeditation and Deliberation Not a Constitutional Violation.
   
   - The court rejected the defendant's argument that because the indictment failed to allege two essential elements of first degree murder, i.e., premeditation and deliberation, his conviction of first degree murder based thereon violated Article I, G.S. 19, 22 and 23 of the North Carolina Constitution. The court found that the defendant had adequate notice of the charge against him, as North Carolina has for nearly 100 years authorized the use of the short form murder indictment as sufficient to allege the elements of premeditation and deliberation, and the jury was properly required to find those elements beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Holder, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 530 S.E.2d 562 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment of murder in the first degree need not allege deliberation and premeditation, an indictment in the form prescribed by this section being sufficient. State v. Kirksey, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 445</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 613 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        By virtue of this section premeditation and deliberation do not have to be alleged in an indictment for first degree murder. State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 596</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 878 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant was convicted for, inter alia, first degree murder, he argued unsuccessfully on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the short-form indictment because the indictment did not include the requisite elements of premeditation and deliberation to charge him with first degree murder, nor did it allege the elements of felony murder. Specifically alleging premeditation and deliberation was not required by G.S. 15-144. State v. Stitt, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 689 S.E.2d 539 (2009), review denied <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 246</cite>, 699 S.E.2d 920, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 493 (2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor That Murder was Committed in Course of Felony.
   
   - A bill of indictment, drawn in the statutory from as required by this section, includes the charge of murder committed in the perpetration of a robbery, without a specific allegation or count to that effect. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 457</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 114 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not required that an indictment allege that a murder was committed in the perpetration of a robbery or other felony in order that it be sufficient to support a verdict of murder in the first degree. State v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 181</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 652, death sentence vacated, 409 U.S. 1004, 93 S. Ct. 453, 34 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not necessary that an indictment for murder committed in the attempt to perpetrate larceny should contain a specific allegation of the attempted larceny, such allegation not having been necessary in indictments prior to the adoption of the section. State v. Covington, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 834</cite>, 23 S.E. 337 (1895).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Short-form murder indictment which did not allege premeditation
   
   nor the elements of felony murder was held not defective. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 112</cite>, 371 S.E.2d 689 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment Need Not State Victim's Sex.
   
   - An indictment is not defective for failure to allege whether the person killed was a man or woman, or whether the mortal wound was inflicted by poisoning, stabbing or shooting. State v. Pate, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 659</cite>, 28 S.E. 354 (1897).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Defendant's County of Residence.
   
   - Defendant's county of residence is not an element of murder and not required to be proved at trial. Therefore, it need not be alleged. State v. Carswell, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 752, 253 S.E.2d 635, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 613</cite>, 257 S.E.2d 220 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Omission of the county of defendant's residence from murder indictment did not make the indictment fatally defective, since the county of defendant's residence did not have to be proved. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 676</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 579 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Word "willfully" is not essential to validity of an indictment for murder,
   
   neither at common law nor under this section. State v. Kirkman, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 911</cite>, 10 S.E. 312 (1889); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 682</cite>, 11 S.E. 377 (1890); State v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 861</cite>, 11 S.E. 990 (1890).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Omission of Word "Wound" Not Fatal.
   
   - The omission of the word "wound" in an indictment for murder was held not fatal, long before the adoption of the present short form of indictment for murder under this section. State v. Rinehart, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 52</cite> (1876); State v. Ratliff, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 707</cite>, 86 S.E. 997 (1915).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Malice Is Necessary Allegation.
   
   - A murder indictment should not fail to charge malice, as it is a necessary allegation in a murder indictment. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 485</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 169 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Allege Malice Aforethought
   
   - Where defendant's indictment for attempted first degree murder was deficient, under N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   22 and G.S. 15-144, as it omitted the phrase "and of his malice aforethought," the appellate court, after defendant was convicted by a jury of attempted first degree murder, arrested the judgment and remanded the matter for sentencing and the entry of judgment for attempted voluntary manslaughter, which the indictment supported. State v. Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 574 S.E.2d 17, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 64</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 396, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 928, 124 S. Ct. 338, 157 L. Ed. 2d 231 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remand for sentencing and entry of judgment for attempted voluntary manslaughter was appropriate because, although the indictment against defendant for attempted first-degree murder failed to include the essential element of malice aforethought, the jury's guilty verdict of attempted first-degree murder necessarily meant that they found all of the elements of the lesser-included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 762 S.E.2d 894 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Meaning of "Malice Aforethought."
   
   - The term "malice aforethought," which is used in an indictment conforming to this section cannot be held to import into the definition of first degree murder the element of premeditation or deliberation. Indeed, it is rather definitely indicated that it relates rather to the prior existence of the malice which motivates the murder than to a previously entertained purpose. State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 596</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 878 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Omission of the phrase "with force and arms"
   
   does not render a defendant's indictment for murder fatally defective. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 676</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 579 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment need not include aggravating circumstances or differentiate first-degree murder from second-degree murder.
   
   State v. Lawrence, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 1</cite>, 530 S.E.2d 807 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Essentials Make No Distinction Between First and Second Degree Murder.
   
   - The essentials for bills of indictment charging homicide make no distinction between an indictment charging murder in the first degree from one charging murder in the second degree. State v. Castor, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 220 S.E.2d 819, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 453</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 161 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment which meets the requirements of this section will support a plea of guilty to or a conviction of either first or second degree murder. State v. King, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 603</cite>, 320 S.E.2d 1 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        A prosecutor is not required to determine, before the return of the indictment, whether he will ultimately prosecute a defendant for murder in the first or second degree. State v. King, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 603</cite>, 320 S.E.2d 1 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The State is not required at any time to elect a theory
   
   upon which it will proceed against defendant on a charge of first degree murder, and it is proper for the trial court to submit the issue of defendant's guilt of that charge to the jury on each of the theories of first degree murder supported by substantial evidence presented at trial; rather than have the jury render a general verdict if it finds defendant guilty of first degree murder, the better practice is for the trial court to have the jury specify the theory or theories upon which it finds first degree murder to have been established beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 677</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 191 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of State's Election of Felony Murder Theory.
   
   - The State's election to try a homicide case, and the trial judge's submission of it to the jury, only on a felony murder theory did not in effect acquit defendant of murder on a theory of premeditation and deliberation and all of its lesser included homicide offenses. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 583</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 555 (1989), holding that the jury should have been instructed on involuntary murder under the circumstances.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Short-Form Indictments Did Not Have to Allege Aggravating Factors.
   
   - Where defendant pled guilty to second-degree murder, the trial court did not err in finding the fact that the victim was eight months pregnant to be an aggravating factor and in sentencing him in the aggravated range; as defendant was indicted using a short-form murder indictment, the aggravating factors were not required to be alleged. State v. Hasty, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 639 S.E.2d 94 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Offenses Which Indictment Will Support.
   
   - An indictment for homicide in the words of this section will support a verdict of murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, or manslaughter. State v. Talbert, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 718</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 822 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        A bill of indictment drawn in the words of this section is sufficient to support a conviction of murder in the first degree. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 511</cite>, 227 S.E.2d 97 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment in the form declared by this section to be sufficient to charge the offense of murder is also sufficient to sustain judgment entered upon defendant's plea of nolo contendere to the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. State v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 197 S.E.2d 237, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 758</cite>, 198 S.E.2d 729 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment drawn in accordance with this section is sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree based upon a finding that defendant killed with malice, premeditation and deliberation, or that defendant killed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any arson, rape, robbery, burglary or other felony. State v. May, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 644</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 178, reconsideration denied, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 261</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 234, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 928, 98 S. Ct. 414, 54 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment for murder in the form prescribed by this section is sufficient to support a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree if the jury finds from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant killed the deceased with malice and after premeditation and deliberation or in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery, burglary or other felony. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 202</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 666 (1972); State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 485</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 169 (1974); State v. McLaughlin, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 597</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 238 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3206, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1208 (1976); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 437 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A bill is sufficient to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree if the jury should find from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the killing was done with malice and after premeditation and deliberation; or in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate a robbery. State v. Haynes, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 150</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 435 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment under this section will support a verdict of murder in the first degree if the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused killed with malice and after premeditation and deliberation or in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any arson, rape, robbery, burglary or other felony the commission of which creates any substantial foreseeable human risk and actually results in loss of life. State v. Bush, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 159</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 333, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        A bill of indictment meeting the requirements of this section concerning murder will support a conviction or plea of guilty to murder in the first degree as well as to murder in the second degree. State v. Melton, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 370</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 673 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The short-form indictment drawn in accordance with this section is sufficient to charge murder in the first degree under a theory of lying in wait, just as it is sufficient to charge murder in the first degree on the theory of felony murder or premeditation and deliberation. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 179</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 1, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 970, 108 S. Ct. 467, 98 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment in the form prescribed by this section will support a verdict finding the defendant guilty of first-degree murder upon any of the theories set forth in G.S. 14-17 or guilty of any lesser offense included within any of those theories. The test in every case involving the propriety of an instruction on a lesser grade of an offense is not whether the jury could convict defendant of the lesser crime, but whether the State's evidence is positive as to each element of the crime charged and whether there is any conflicting evidence relating to any of these elements. State v. Leroux, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 368</cite>, 390 S.E.2d 314, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 871, 111 S. Ct. 192, 112 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the indictment was insufficient to allege attempted first degree murder because the indictment failed to include the essential element of malice aforethought, but was sufficient to allege voluntary manslaughter, the case could be remanded for sentencing and entry of judgment for attempted voluntary manslaughter based on the jury's verdict. State v. Bullock, - N.C. App.
   - , 566 S.E.2d 768 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        G.S. 15-144, when construed alongside G.S. 15-170, implicitly authorizes the State to utilize a short-form indictment to charge attempted first-degree murder; when drafting such a indictment, it is sufficient for statutory purposes for the State to allege that the accused person feloniously, willfully, and of his malice aforethought, did (attempt to) kill and murder the named victim. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 832</cite>, 616 S.E.2d 496 (2005).

        Indictment Sufficient to Charge Conspiracy to Murder.
   
   - See State v. Graham, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 591, 211 S.E.2d 805, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 262</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 434 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Short-Form Indictment Insufficient to Charge Attempted Murder.
   
   - The application of G.S. 15-144 to indictments for attempted murder goes beyond the plain language of the statute, and absent statutory authority for a short-form indictment, the State must allege all essential elements of the crime charged; nothing in G.S. 15-153 or G.S. 15-155, which dealt with certain informalities and defects that did not vitiate a warrant or indictment, dispensed with the requirement that the essential elements of the offense had to be charged. State v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 610 S.E.2d 746 (2005), cert. denied, appeal dismissed, - N.C.
   - , 624 S.E.2d 632 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the original indictment charging defendant with attempted first-degree murder was constitutionally and statutorily sufficient to provide jurisdiction, allege attempted voluntary manslaughter, and was not fatally defective, no manifest necessity existed to declare a mistrial over defendant's objections, the State was barred from re-indicting defendant on attempted murder or manslaughter and the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the subsequent indictment. Therefore, defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated by his subsequent indictment, prosecution, trial, and conviction of attempted first-degree murder. State v. Schalow, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 795 S.E.2d 567 (2016).

        Felony murder may be proven although murder is charged in the language of this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment charging the essential facts of murder as required by this section is sufficient to sustain the court's charge based upon the evidence in the case relative to murder committed in the perpetration of robbery or other felony. State v. Fogleman, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 401</cite>, 168 S.E. 536 (1933).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Proof of Felony Murder Under Indictment for Different Offense.
   
   - An indictment for homicide in the language of this section is sufficient and proof that the murder was committed in the perpetration of a felony constitutes no variance. State v. Crawford, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 548</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 232 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where indictment charged capital felony of murder in the language of this section and contained every necessary averment, proof that murder was committed in the perpetration of felony constituted no variance between allegata and probata. State v. Mays, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 486</cite>, 35 S.E.2d 494 (1945); State v. Grayson, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 453</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 387 (1954); State v. Scales, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 400</cite>, 87 S.E.2d 916 (1955).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance in Time Held Not Fatal.
   
   - Where an indictment for murder charged the killing to have taken place December 5 and the evidence showed that, while the deceased was wounded on that day, he died three days thereafter, and before the bill of indictment was found, the variance was not fatal. State v. Pate, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 659</cite>, 28 S.E. 354 (1897).

      <li id="t15a15s15-144.1ol1a">
       In indictments for rape it is not necessary to allege every matter required to be proved on the trial; but in the body of the indictment, after naming the person accused, the date of the offense, the county in which the offense of rape was allegedly committed, and the averment "with force and arms," it is sufficient in describing rape to allege that the accused person unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did ravish and carnally know the victim, naming her, by force and against her will and concluding as required by law. Any bill of indictment containing the averments and allegations named in this section is good and sufficient in law as an indictment for rape in the first degree and will support a verdict of guilty of rape in the first degree, rape in the second degree, attempted rape, or assault on a female.

      <li id="t15a15s15-144.1ol1b">
       If the victim is a female child under the age of 13 years, it is sufficient to allege that the accused unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did carnally know and abuse a child under 13, naming her, and concluding as required by law. Any bill of indictment containing the averments and allegations named in this section is good and sufficient in law as an indictment for the rape of a female child under the age of 13 years and all lesser included offenses.

       If the victim is a person who has a mental disability or who is mentally incapacitated or physically helpless, it is sufficient to allege that the defendant unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did carnally know and abuse a person who had a mental disability or who was mentally incapacitated or physically helpless, naming the victim, and concluding as required by law. Any bill of indictment containing the averments and allegations named in this section is good and sufficient in law for the rape of a person who has a mental disability or who is mentally incapacitated or physically helpless and all lesser included offenses.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Section Eliminates Requirement That Every Element Be Alleged.
   
   - Prior to the enactment of this section it was necessary that an indictment for rape contain allegations of every element of the offense. This section, in which the legislature explicitly states that "[i]n indictments for rape it is not necessary to allege every matter required to be proved on the trial," eliminates that requirement. State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 596</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 878 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       In enacting this section, the legislature eliminated the requirement that every element to be proven at trial must be alleged in the indictment. State v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 540, 353 S.E.2d 245 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       And Differs from Federal Equivalent.
   
   - The defendant's short-form indictment for rape which failed to specifically allege all the elements of each offense was not defective in spite of the United States Supreme Court's holding, in United States v. Jones, 526 U.S. 227, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311, 119 S. Ct. 1215 (1999), that all indictments must so allege. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 535 S.E.2d 614 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       But Is Constitutional.
   
   - This section complies with constitutional requirement that the defendant be informed of the accusation against him even though it eliminates the requirement that the indictment contain allegations of every element of the offense. State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 596</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 878 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Eight indictments against defendant for first-degree rape comported with federal and state constitutional requirements although they did not contain each element and fact which might increase the maximum punishment for the crime charged. State v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 481</cite>, 528 S.E.2d 326, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1018, 121 S. Ct. 581, 148 L. Ed. 2d 498 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's short-form indictment charging attempted first-degree rape was proper because North Carolina had consistently upheld the constitutionality of the use of the short-form indictment in rape cases as prescribed by the statute. State v. Owen, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 204, 582 S.E.2d 689 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Due Process Concerns.
   
   - G.S. 15-144.1 cannot reasonably be read to provide that a short-form rape indictment is sufficient to support a conviction based on events not directly relating to an alleged rape. It would raise serious notice concerns if the State, unable to prove rape or attempted rape, could nonetheless obtain a conviction for an uncharged assault occurring before or after the sexual encounter. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 676 S.E.2d 56 (2009).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       In enacting this section the legislature prescribed a new form of indictment for rape.
   
   State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 596</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 878 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Section Modeled upon G.S.
   
   15-144. - The short-form indictment for homicide in G.S. 15-144 is the model upon which this section was drafted. State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 596</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 878 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Indictment Under This Section Is Constitutional.
   
   - An indictment under this section is constitutional if it permits the defendant to prepare a defense and to be protected from subsequent prosecution for the same offense. State v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 540, 353 S.E.2d 245 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A short form indictment is constitutionally sufficient
   
   to charge a defendant with first degree rape. State v. Getward, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 365 S.E.2d 209 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       One purpose of an indictment
   
   is to give the defendant notice of the charge against him to the end that he may prepare a defense and be in a position to plead double jeopardy if he is again brought to trial for the same offense. Another purpose is to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce in case of conviction. State v. Sills, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 370</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 379 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Allegation as to Age of Victim.
   
   - An allegation that the victim was "a female child eight (8) years old" sufficiently alleged that she was "a child under 12" and satisfied the requirement of subsection (b) of this section as it existed on June 6, 1983. State v. Ollis, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 370</cite>, 348 S.E.2d 777 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Use of Victim's Initials Rather Than Victim's Name Sufficient.
       </b>
       - Second-degree rape indictment was not facially invalid because it failed to state the name of the victim, as the use of the victim's initials was sufficient. State v. Pabon, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       State's failure to set forth the marital status of the parties
   
   involved is not fatal to an indictment for rape. State v. Getward, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 365 S.E.2d 209 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Unnecessary Averments.
   
   - This section authorizes an indictment for first degree rape which omits averments (1) that the offense was perpetrated with a deadly weapon or by inflicting serious bodily injury, or (2) as to the defendant's age, two elements the proof of which were essential to a conviction for first degree rape. State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 596</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 878 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The date given in a bill of indictment usually is not an essential element of the crime charged. The State may prove that the crime was in fact committed on some other date. This rule, however, may not be used to deprive a defendant of his defense. State v. Sills, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 370</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 379 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the indictments for attempted rape fully complied with the requirements set forth in this section, the indictments were not insufficient merely because neither indictment alleged that the victims of the crimes were females. State v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 131</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 611 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficiency of Indictment Under This Section and G.S.
   
   15-144.2. - The short form indictments set out in this section and G.S. 15-144.2 for first-degree rape and first-degree sexual offense provide adequate notice of the charges. State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       By enacting G.S. 15-144.1(a) and G.S. 15-144.2(a), the statutes for short-form indictments, the General Assembly provided a method by which indictments can be certain to be sufficient to withstand constitutional challenges. State v. McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 650, 675 S.E.2d 406 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 586</cite>, 683 S.E.2d 215 (2009).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section do not prevail over G.S.
   
   15-155. State v. Sills, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 370</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 379 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction with G.S. 15-155 as to "with Force and Arms".
   
   - G.S. 15-155 does not either require the averment "with force and arms" or express a legislative intent that the language in subsection (a) of this section prevail over the express language in G.S. 15-155, which states in effect that no judgment shall be stayed or reversed because of the omission of the words "with force and arms" from the indictment. State v. Corbett, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 169</cite>, 297 S.E.2d 553 (1982); State v. Welch, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 318 S.E.2d 4 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment in a rape case under this section need not contain the phrase "with force and arms." State v. Cheek, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 552</cite>, 299 S.E.2d 633 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction With Offense of Assault on Female.
   
   - G.S. 15-144.1 did not provide that a short-form rape indictment was sufficient to support a conviction based on events not directly relating to the alleged rape; therefore, defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction regarding assault on a female. Evidence of assault on a female - threatening the victim with a rifle if she left the car, macing her, and dragging her back to the car after an escape attempt - was unrelated to the conduct that gave rise to the first degree rape charge; the assault conduct occurred during the kidnapping, not during the "carnal knowing." State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 676 S.E.2d 56 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a rape prosecution, the fact that a lesser charge of assault on a female would not be available when a defendant asserts that the intercourse was consensual does not nullify the reference in G.S. 15-144.1 to assault on a female. A jury could find a defendant not guilty of rape under G.S. 14-27.2 or G.S. 14-27.3 based on evidence that defendant's penis had not vaginally penetrated the victim. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 676 S.E.2d 56 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to G.S. 15-144.1, trial court properly declined to instruct a jury regarding assault on a female. Conduct that defendant relied on as supporting assault charge was unrelated to conduct supporting first degree rape under G.S. 14-27.2; however, that conduct supported G.S. 14-39 kidnapping conviction. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 676 S.E.2d 56 (2009).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill of Particulars.
   
   - The granting of a motion for a bill of particulars lies within the discretion of the trial court and is not subject to review by the appellate courts except for gross abuse of discretion. State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The denial of a defendant's motion for a bill of particulars will be held error only upon a clear showing that the lack of timely access to the information significantly impaired the defendant's preparation and conduct of his case. State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant may request a bill of particulars to obtain information to supplement the facts contained in the indictment. State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Election by State.
   
   - By unequivocally arraigning defendant on second-degree rape and by failing thereafter to give any notice whatsoever, prior to the jury being impaneled and jeopardy attaching, of an intent instead to pursue a conviction for first-degree rape as arguably supported by the short-form indictment, the state made a binding election not to pursue the greater degree of the offense, and such election was tantamount to an acquittal of first-degree rape. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 487</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 657 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Election of Trial Court Not to Submit Lesser Included Offenses.
   
   - Although the trial court elected not to submit the lesser included offense of attempted second degree rape and the offense of assault on a female to the jury, defendant was not acquitted of those charges, where there was a mistrial because of a hung jury, and defendant had been indicted only on second degree rape. State v. Hatcher, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 450 S.E.2d 19 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment Upheld.
   
   - Indictment for second-degree rape, which met the criteria specified in this section for a proper indictment for rape, was sufficient to allow defendant to prepare a defense and to be protected from double jeopardy, and was thus not fatally defective. State v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 540, 353 S.E.2d 245 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Rape indictment drawn in accordance with this section was sufficient enough to let defendant know that he was charged with the rape of his estranged wife and to allow him to prepare his defense. State v. Getward, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 365 S.E.2d 209 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by entering judgment on short form indictments because short form indictments were specifically approved for the offense of first-degree rape of a child under the age of 13 under G.S. 15-144.1(b). State v. Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 631 S.E.2d 868 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 222</cite>, 642 S.E.2d 708 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court had jurisdiction to enter judgment on defendant's statutory rape charge under G.S. 14-27.7A(a) as the indictment was not facially invalid because it alleged that defendant carnally knew the victim, instead of that he had vaginal intercourse with the victim since at common law, carnal knowledge and sexual intercourse were synonymous; the indictment alleged all material elements of G.S. 14-27.7A, even though it did not contain the language "by force and against her will" under G.S. 15-144.1 since G.S. 15-144.1 did not apply as its subsections did not address an indictment for statutory rape of a child 13, 14, or 15 years old. State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 784, 741 S.E.2d 422 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       State could use a short form indictment to indict defendant for the attempted statutory rape because the alleged victim was 13 years old. State v. Gibert, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 747 S.E.2d 253 (2013), review denied, 755 S.E.2d 616, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 211 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because neither force nor a lack of consent were elements of the crime of attempted statutory rape, the State was not required to prove that the vaginal intercourse was by force and against the victim's will, and, therefore, such an allegation was not required in the short form indictment. State v. Gibert, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 747 S.E.2d 253 (2013), review denied, 755 S.E.2d 616, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 211 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Short form indictment was sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the trial court because the phrase "ravish and carnally know" was essentially synonymous with vaginal intercourse where the victim was under the age of consent; the indictment alleged that defendant attempted to engage in vaginal intercourse with the victim; and allegations of force or a lack of consent were not required as they were not elements of the crime of attempted statutory rape. State v. Gibert, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 747 S.E.2d 253 (2013), review denied, 755 S.E.2d 616, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 211 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of Words "And/Or" in Indictment Acceptable.
   
   - Use of the words "and/or" did not render a short form indictment for rape facially invalid because a person of common understanding would know that the intent of the indictment was to accuse defendant of having sexual intercourse with a person deemed by law to be incapable of giving consent. In turn, this language was sufficient to notify defendant of the charges against him in order to prepare an adequate defense and to protect him from being punished a second time for the same act. State v. Haddock, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 474, 664 S.E.2d 339 (2008).

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t15a15s15-144.2ol1a">
       In indictments for sex offense it is not necessary to allege every matter required to be proved on the trial; but in the body of the indictment, after naming the person accused, the date of the offense, the county in which the sex offense was allegedly committed, and the averment "with force and arms," it is sufficient in describing a sex offense to allege that the accused person unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did engage in a sex offense with the victim, naming the victim, by force and against the will of the victim and concluding as required by law. Any bill of indictment containing the averments and allegations named in this section is good and sufficient in law as an indictment for a first degree sex offense and will support a verdict of guilty of a sex offense in the first degree, a sex offense in the second degree, an attempt to commit a sex offense, or an assault.
      </li>
      <li id="t15a15s15-144.2ol1b">
       If the victim is a person under the age of 13 years, it is sufficient to allege that the defendant unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did engage in a sex offense with a child under the age of 13 years, naming the child, and concluding as required by law. Any bill of indictment containing the averments and allegations named in this section is good and sufficient in law as an indictment for a sex offense against a child under the age of 13 years and all lesser included offenses.

      <li id="t15a15s15-144.2ol1c">
       If the victim is a person who has a mental disability or who is mentally incapacitated or physically helpless, it is sufficient to allege that the defendant unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did engage in a sex offense with a person who had a mental disability or who was mentally incapacitated or physically helpless, naming the victim, and concluding as required by law. Any bill of indictment containing the averments and allegations named in this section is good and sufficient in law for a sex offense against a person who has a mental disability or who is mentally incapacitated or physically helpless and all lesser included offenses.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Short-Form Indictments Constitutionally Valid
   
   - Defendant's argument that short-form indictments that alleged first-degree sexual offense were insufficient was without merit, given the Supreme Court of North Carolina's holding in State v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 481</cite>, 528 S.E.2d 326 (2000), that such indictments were constitutional. State v. Shepherd, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 575 S.E.2d 776 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Requirements of a State Short-Form Indictment Are Less Stringent than Its Federal Equivalent.
   
   - The defendant's short-form indictment for sex offense which failed to specifically allege all the elements of each offense was not defective in spite of the United States Supreme Court's holding, in United States v. Jones, 526 U.S. 227, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311, 119 S. Ct. 1215 (1999), that all indictments must so allege. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 535 S.E.2d 614 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment Sufficient to Charge Second Degree Sexual Offense.
   
   - Trial court erred by accepting the jury's verdict of guilty of second-degree sex offense because count one of the indictment charged attempted second-degree sex offense as it did not allege that the crime against nature was by force and against the victim's will. State v. Gates, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 732, 789 S.E.2d 880 (2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Omission of Elements Distinguishing First and Second Degree Offenses.
   
   - Subsection (a) authorizes, for sexual offense, an abbreviated form of indictment which omits allegations of the particular elements that distinguish first-degree and second-degree sexual offense. State v. Berkley, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 163, 287 S.E.2d 445 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Specification of Sexual Act Unnecessary.
   
   - An indictment drafted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section without specifying which sexual act was committed is sufficient to charge the crime of first-degree sexual offense and to inform the defendant of such accusation. Should a defendant require additional information on the nature of the specific sexual act with which he stands charged, he may move for a bill of particulars. State v. Effler, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 742</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 203 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment which charges first degree sexual offense in accordance with this section without specifying which sexual act was committed is sufficient to charge the crime of first degree sexual offense and to put defendant on notice of the accusation. State v. Kennedy, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 20</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 359 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment charging defendant with statutory sexual offense under G.S. 14-27.2, statutory sexual offense of a person who was 13, 14, or 15 years of age under G.S. 14-27.7A, taking indecent liberties with a child under G.S. 14-202.1, and forcible sexual offense under G.S. 14-27.5 that did not list the specific underlying sexual acts was valid, as the jury was instructed on the specific sexual acts that were to serve as the underlying act for each charged offense; when a short form indictment properly alleged the essential elements of the offense, it did not have to allege every matter required to be proved on the trial under G.S. 15-144.2(a), and indictments charging indecent liberties with a child or a sexual offense were valid even when they did not contain a specific allegation regarding which specific sexual act was committed. State v. Mueller, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 647 S.E.2d 440 (2007), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 91</cite>, 657 S.E.2d 24 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment was not insufficient to support defendant's conviction for felonious child abuse, as the State was not required to specifically allege the particular sexual act that defendant committed. State v. Lark, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 678 S.E.2d 693 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 808</cite>, 692 S.E.2d 111 N.C. LEXIS 108 (2010).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       For an indictment to be legally valid
   
   under this statute, it must contain only the following: the name of the accused, the date of the offense, the county in which the offense was allegedly committed, the averment "with force and arms," the allegation that the accused unlawfully, willfully and feloniously engaged in a sex offense with the victim by force and against the victim's will, and the victim's name. An indictment including such information is sufficient to charge first-degree sexual offense, second-degree sexual offense, attempt to commit a sexual offense or assault. State v. Dillard, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 368 S.E.2d 442 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The indictments against the defendant for first-degree sexual offense and for indecent liberties with a child were upheld
   
   in spite of his allegations that they were defective as a matter of law in not setting out each element of the offenses. State v. Youngs, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 540 S.E.2d 794 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment Under Subsection (b) Need Not Specify Sexual Act.
   
   - An indictment drafted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section without specifying which sexual act was committed is sufficient to charge the crime of first-degree sexual offense and to inform the defendant of such accusation. Should a defendant require additional information on the nature of the specific sexual act with which he stands charged, he may move for a bill of particulars. State v. Effler, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 742</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 203 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is essential that the State prove a "sexual act," as defined by G.S. 14-27.1(4), in order to convict a defendant under G.S. 14-27.4, an indictment which is drafted pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section without specifying which "sexual act" was committed is sufficient to charge the crime of first-degree sexual offense and to inform a defendant of such accusation. If a defendant wishes additional information in the nature of the specific "sexual act" with which he stands charged, he may move for a bill of particulars. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 378</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 360 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       But Defendant May Demand to Know Specific "Sexual Act" Charged.
   
   - When the State does not specify at the outset which "sexual act" was committed by a defendant, it can be required to do so before trial on the indictment is had. State v. Loudner, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 335 S.E.2d 78 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       State Bound by Allegation of Specific Sexual Act.
   
   - While the State was not required to allege the specific nature of the sex act in the indictment, having chosen to do so, it is bound by its allegations. State v. Loudner, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 335 S.E.2d 78 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Must Correspond to Allegations.
   
   - The evidence in a criminal prosecution must correspond to the material allegations of the indictment, and where the evidence tends to show the commission of an offense not charged in the indictment, the defendant's conviction thereof cannot stand. State v. Loudner, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 335 S.E.2d 78 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's convictions on six counts of first-degree sexual offense had to be vacated, as a fatal variance existed between the offense charged, which the State said in the indictment was by force and against the victim's will, and the fact that the State did not present any evidence that the alleged offenses were forcible and the trial court's instruction to the jury that the offense was based on the victim being under 13-years-old. State v. Lawrence, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 200, 612 S.E.2d 678 (2005), rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 368</cite>, 627 S.E.2d 609 (2006).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficiency of Indictment Under G.S. 15-144.1 and This Section.
   
   - The short form indictments set out in G.S. 15-144.1 and this section for first-degree rape and first-degree sexual offense provide adequate notice of the charges. State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       By enacting G.S. 15-144.1(a) and G.S. 15-144.2(a), the statutes for short-form indictments, the General Assembly provided a method by which indictments can be certain to be sufficient to withstand constitutional challenges. State v. McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 650, 675 S.E.2d 406 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 586</cite>, 683 S.E.2d 215 (2009).

      </p>
      <p>
       Petition Sufficient in Juvenile Case.
   
   - Petitions charging appellant, a juvenile, with first-degree sexual offense and crimes against nature were sufficient where they stated that appellant engaged in a sexual act with a child under the age of 13 and that appellant committed the infamous crime against nature with the victim; moreover, the petitions stated that the victim was 7 and that he performed fellatio on appellant. The State did not need to identify the particular sex acts involved or describe the manner in which they were performed, and appellant did not have to be the one performing the sexual act for either of these offenses. In re J.F., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 218, 766 S.E.2d 341 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment Sufficient to Charge First-Degree Sexual Offense.
   
   - This statute provides that if the indictment contains the averment that the victim was under age 13, the indictment is sufficient to charge first-degree sexual offense and all lesser included offenses. State v. Dillard, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 368 S.E.2d 442 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment charging first degree sexual offense which used the words "by force and against the victim's will[.]" was sufficient. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 429 S.E.2d 425, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 162</cite>, 435 S.E.2d 770 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the indictment charging a first-degree sexual offense included the terms "feloniously" and "against the victim's will," the charge was sufficient to charge first-degree sexual offense and was not substantially altered by the addition of the term by force; thus, the trial court did not err in allowing the amendment pursuant to G.S. 15A-923(e). State v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 550 S.E.2d 38 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 72</cite>, 553 S.E.2d 206 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment for first-degree sex offense that matched the form required by G.S. 15-144.2 was sufficient to inform defendant of the charges against him. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 621 S.E.2d 633 (2005), rev'd in part on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 406</cite>, 646 S.E.2d 362 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Short-form indictment charging violation of G.S. 14-27.7A(a) was sufficient when it alleged that defendant unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously engaged in a sexual act with a person of the age of 13 years, that defendant was at least six years older than the victim, and that he was not lawfully married to the victim; the indictment complied with the requirements of G.S. 15-144.2(a) and was sufficient to put him on notice of the crime of which he was accused. State v. Bradley, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 551, 634 S.E.2d 258 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's claim that by failing to differentiate the various charges by providing different dates for the offenses and listing the underlying acts, the indictments opened the door to defendant being subjected to double jeopardy for the same acts on the same dates, was rejected because: (1) defendant's indictments for statutory sexual offense, statutory sexual offense against a person who was 13, 14, or 15 years of age, and sexual offense were in compliance with the requirements of G.S. 15-144.2, and the indictments matched the wording of G.S. 14-27.4(a)(1), G.S. 14-27.7A(a), and G.S. 14-27.5(a)(1); (2) defendant's indictments for the charges of taking indecent liberties with a child matched the wording of G.S.14-202.1(a)(2); and (3) defendant's assault on a female indictments matched the wording of G.S. 14-33(c)(2); each of the indictments was sufficient to inform defendant of the charges against defendant, and defendant failed to show any deprivation of defendant's ability to prepare a defense due to a lack of specificity in the indictments. State v. Mueller, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 647 S.E.2d 440 (2007), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 91</cite>, 657 S.E.2d 24 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment Insufficient to Charge First-Degree Sexual Offense.
   
   - Sexual offense indictments were fatally defective because they cited one statute, but defendant was tried, convicted, and sentenced under another statute, and the averments were insufficient to satisfy all of the elements contained in either statute; while the indictments (1) alleged that each victim was a child under age 13, (2) named each child, and (3) averred that defendant "did engage in a sex act" with each, under the very narrow circumstances presented, the use of "short-form" language authorized under G.S. 15-144.2(b) was not sufficient to cure the fatal defects. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 608, 583 S.E.2d 620 (2003), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 133</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 520 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superseding indictment upon which defendant was tried and convicted of first-degree sex offense with a child was facially defective, and thus failed to establish jurisdiction in the trial court, because the indictment did not name the victim, but identified the alleged victim only as "Victim #1." State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 248</cite>, 827 S.E.2d 80 (2019).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment Invalid.
   
   - Trial court lacked jurisdiction to require defendant to register as a sex offender and prohibit contact with the victims because the trial court did not have jurisdiction over defendant inasmuch as the indictment charging defendant with the statutory rape "of person 13, 14, or 15 years old" was facially defective inasmuch as it did not include the names of the victims. State v. Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 822 S.E.2d 737 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment underlying defendant's conviction for committing a sex offense with a child was fatally defective since the indictment alleged that the defendant had committed the crime charged against "Victim # 1," but did not otherwise name the child and, thus, the State had not complied with G.S. 15-144.2(b). State v. Corey, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 225</cite>, 835 S.E.2d 830 (2019).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       State's bare reference to "a child" in juvenile petitions charging first degree sexual offense violated G.S. 15-144.2(b), which required that the victim be named,
   
   and rendered the petitions facially defective, depriving the trial court of jurisdiction and necessitating vacatur of the trial court's orders. The jurisdiction question could be raised for the first time on appeal. In re M.S., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 681 S.E.2d 441 (2009).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Short Form Constitutionally Valid.
   
   - Short-form indictment for the crime of first-degree sexual offense is constitutionally valid even though it fails to allege one of the elements of sex offense. State v. Love, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite> 608, 568 S.E.2d 320 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 168</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 66 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill of Particulars.
   
   - A defendant may request a bill of particulars to obtain information to supplement the facts contained in the indictment. State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The granting of a motion for a bill of particulars lies within the discretion of the trial court and is not subject to review by the appellate courts except for gross abuse of discretion. State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The denial of a defendant's motion for a bill of particulars will be held error only upon a clear showing that the lack of timely access to the information significantly impaired the defendant's preparation and conduct of his case. State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple Short-Form Indictments Did Not Create a Danger of Ununanimous Verdicts.
   
   - Appellate court erred in reversing defendant's convictions of first-degree statutory rape, G.S. 14-27.2, and taking indecent liberties with a minor, G.S. 14-202.1(a)(1), as defendant was properly charged by short-form indictments on all the charges as authorized by G.S. 15-144.2(a), because there was no danger of a nonunanimous verdict resulting from the multiple indictments in violation of N.C. Const. Art. 1,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24, and G.S. 15A-1237(b), as even if some jurors disagreed on the kinds of sexual misconduct committed, the jury as a whole would unanimously find that there occurred sexual conduct within the ambit of any immoral, improper, or indecent liberties as required by G.S. 14-202.1(a)(1), and because defendant was indicted on five counts of statutory rape, the victim testified to five specific incidents of statutory rape, and five verdicts of guilty were returned.

       § 15-145. Form of bill for perjury.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In every indictment for willful and corrupt perjury it is sufficient to set forth the substance of the offense charged upon the defendant, and by what court, or before whom, the oath was taken (averring such court or person to have competent authority to administer the same), together with the proper averments to falsify the matter wherein the perjury is assigned, without setting forth the bill, answer, information, indictment, declaration, or any part of any record or proceedings, either in law or equity, other than aforesaid, and without setting forth the commission or authority of the court or person before whom the perjury was committed. In indictments for perjury the following form shall be sufficient, to wit:
     </p>
     <p>
      The jurors for the State, on their oath, present, that A.B., of ____________ County, did unlawfully commit perjury upon the trial of an action in ____________ court, in ____________ County, wherein ____________ was plaintiff and ____________ was defendant, by falsely asserting, on oath (or solemn affirmation) (here set out the statement or statements alleged to be false), knowing the said statement, or statements, to be false, or being ignorant whether or not said statement was true.
     </p>
     <p>
      History
     </p>
     <p>
      (1842, c. 49, s. 1; R.C., c. 35, s. 16; Code, s. 1185; 1889, c. 83; Rev., ss. 3246, 3247; C.S., s. 4615.)

      </h4>
      <p>
       Constitutionality.
   
   - The form of indictment for perjury prescribed by this section is sufficient and constitutional. State v. Gates, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 832</cite>, 12 S.E. 319 (1890); State v. Peters, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 876</cite>, 12 S.E. 74 (1890).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose.
   
   - The purpose of this section is to render unnecessary useless details and niceties, in charging the offense of perjury, that one time prevailed to the prejudice of the administration of criminal justice. State v. Robertson, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 751</cite>, 4 S.E. 511 (1887).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of this section
   
   is not to change in any respect the constituent elements of perjury nor the nature or mode of proof. It only relieves the State from charging in the indictment the details, or rather the definition of the offense, and makes it sufficient to allege that the defendant unlawfully committed perjury, charging the name of the action and of the court in which committed, setting out the matter alleged to have been falsely sworn and averring further that the defendant knew such to be false, or that he was ignorant whether or not it was true. State v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 53</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 401 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section dispenses with the necessity of setting forth the record of the indictment, on the trial of which the false oath is alleged to have been taken, and only requires that the substance would be set forth, but it did not dispense with the necessity of making all the averments in an indictment for perjury which were all necessary to be proved, and it is necessary to prove in what court, or before whom, the oath was taken. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 581</cite> (1885).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant Would Not Benefit from Inclusion of Minutiae.
   
   - A defendant certainly can derive no just benefit from the insertion in the charge of the minutiae of what would constitute perjury. It would serve not so much to enlighten the defendant as to the charge he was to meet, as to present a network of technicalities which hindered the trial of the cause upon its merits and very often caused a miscarriage of justice. State v. Gates, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 832</cite>, 12 S.E. 319 (1890).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Elements of Proof Not Changed by Section.
   
   - This section has merely simplified the form of the indictment for perjury, and the constituent elements of the offense remain unchanged and require the same proof to establish the commission of the crime. State v. Peters, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 876</cite>, 12 S.E. 74 (1890); State v. Cline, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 640</cite>, 61 S.E. 522 (1908).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction with G.S.
   
   15-146. - Since the commission of perjury by another is the basic element in the crime of subornation of perjury, it is appropriate to read this section and G.S. 15-146 together. State v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 53</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 401 (1956); State v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 208</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 366 (1957).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment Required for Perjury.
   
   - A person charged with perjury must be indicted by the grand jury as the offense is a felony. A trial without an indictment is contrary to N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   22. State v. Hyman, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 411</cite>, 79 S.E. 284 (1913).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient Averment of Jurisdiction.
   
   - The jurisdiction of the justice of the peace of the complaint upon the examination whereof the alleged perjury was committed is sufficiently averred, where it is averred that the justice had power to administer the oath. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. 495</cite> (1873).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Allege Knowledge of Falsity.
   
   - Although an indictment for perjury, which fails to allege that the defendant "knew the said statement to be false," or that "he was ignorant whether or not said statement was false," is defective, the court should not quash it, but the defendant should be held until a proper indictment is had. State v. Flowers, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 841</cite>, 13 S.E. 718 (1891).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Materiality of False Testimony Need Not Be Charged.
   
   - Prior to the adoption of this section, in indictments for perjury the indictment was required to charge that the alleged false testimony was material to the issue. Since this section was passed, however, it has been repeatedly held that this need not appear in the indictment. State v. Hawley, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 433</cite>, 119 S.E. 888 (1923), overruling State v. Cline, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 854</cite>, 64 S.E. 591 (1909).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Since Averment of Perjury Includes It.
   
   - The averment in a bill that defendant committed perjury involves necessarily the charge that the false testimony was material to the issue. State v. Cline, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 640</cite>, 61 S.E. 522 (1908).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Word "Feloniously" Not Required.
   
   - This section does not make the word "feloniously" a part of the bill, and it does not appear in the form set out, and the same is, therefore, no longer required. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 456</cite>, 59 S.E. 115 (1907), overruling State v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 764</cite>, 23 S.E. 246 (1895) and State v. Bunting, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 1120</cite>, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 1200</cite>, 24 S.E. 118 (1896); State v. Holder, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 606</cite>, 69 S.E. 66 (1910).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Variance as to Term of Court Held Fatal.
   
   - Where an indictment for perjury charged that the false oath was taken at one term of a court in a trial between A and B and the records of that court showed that at that term there was no trial between these parties, but the record showed that at a term other than the one alleged in the indictment there was such a trial, and the judge allowed this record to be introduced, this was held error, and the variance was fatal. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 581</cite> (1885).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of "Suit, Controversy, or Investigation" to Describe Proceeding.
   
   - Where perjury was alleged to have been committed in the trial of a "suit, controversy, or investigation," without a definite statement of the nature of the proceeding, the words, "suit, controversy, or investigation," under this section, may be regarded as surplusage in a bill of indictment charging perjury, and a motion to quash upon the ground that there was indefiniteness of statement of the nature of the proceeding will not be sustained. State v. Hawley, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 433</cite>, 119 S.E. 888 (1923).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Style of Court.
   
   - The style of the court before which the perjury is alleged to have been committed must be legally set forth. State v. Street, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. 156</cite>, 3 Am. Dec. 682 (1807), decided prior to enactment of this section.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Name of Justice of the Peace.
   
   - An indictment for perjury, alleged to have been committed upon a trial in the court of a justice of the peace, is not defective because it sets out the name of the justice before whom the case was tried. Addition of the justice's name does not harm the defendant. At most its inclusion is mere surplusage. State v. Flowers, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 841</cite>, 13 S.E. 718 (1891), decided prior to abolition of justices of the peace.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In every indictment for subornation of perjury, or for corrupt bargaining or contracting with others to commit willful and corrupt perjury, it is sufficient to set forth the substance of the offense charged upon the defendant, without setting forth the bill, answer, information, indictment, declaration or any part of any record or proceedings, and without setting forth the commission or authority of the court or person before whom the perjury was committed or was agreed or promised to be committed.

       Allegations Required Generally.
   
   - This section requires that an indictment for subornation of perjury should charge that the defendant did unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously procure another to willfully and corruptly commit perjury. State v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 606</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 570 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment under this section should designate the court and the nature of the case wherein the alleged perjury occurred, and set out either the false statement or statements defendant is alleged to have procured another to make, or that the defendant knew said statement or statements to be false, or that he was ignorant as to whether or not such statement or statements were true. State v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 606</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 570 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment Required to Set Forth Underlying Perjury.
   
   - Since the commission of the crime of perjury is the basic element in the crime of subornation of perjury, it is appropriate to read this section and G.S. 15-145 in reference to each other. And if it be essential to charge the offense of perjury in conformity to the form of indictment prescribed in G.S. 15-145, it would seem equally clear that in an indictment charging subornation of perjury the crime of perjury constituting the basis therefor is required to be set forth in conformity to the form of indictment so prescribed. State v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 53</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 401 (1956); State v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 208</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 366 (1957).

      <p>
       Purpose of Section.
   
   - An indictment, before 1877, for stealing "money" without further description could not have been sustained, and the Legislature, to remedy the difficulty of describing and identifying bank bills, treasury notes, etc., which may be stolen, passed this section. State v. Reese, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 637</cite> (1880).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Amount Should Be Charged.
   
   - The term "money," without anything added to make it more definite, is too loose in indictments, and it should be described at least by the amount, as to how many dollars and cents. State v. Reese, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 637</cite> (1880).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Charge Sufficient.
   
   - The charge of the theft of "five dollars in money of the value of five dollars" is good under this section, and is sustained by the proof of the theft of any kind of coin or treasury or bank notes without proof of the particular kind of coin or treasury or bank notes. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 639</cite>, 18 S.E. 517 (1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inasmuch as money is the measure of values, a charge in an indictment of taking "ten dollars in money" is an allegation of taking "the value of ten dollars." State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 645</cite>, 18 S.E. 51 (1893).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Variance Not Found.
   
   - Where an indictment charged the larceny of "thirty dollars in money," and the proof was that defendant stole "three ten-dollar bills" it was not a variance. State v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 469</cite> (1883).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment for False Pretenses.
    -
   
   - While the statute said it applied to larceny, indictments for larceny and obtaining property by false pretenses were required to have the same degree of certain; "money" is a sufficient description of the property under the statute, and in this case, the indictment for obtaining property by false pretenses went above that requirement by describing the money as "U.S. Currency," and thus no fatal defect in the indictment was found. State v. Ricks, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 742, 781 S.E.2d 637 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute merely relieved the drafter of the more stringent requirement to describe and identify the exact type of bank bills, Treasury notes, etc. that were obtained; unlike today, where paper money consists solely of "federal reserve notes," paper money in the 1800's was issued in a variety of forms, including "bank notes" issued by state and federally-chartered banks and "treasury notes" issued by the federal government. State v. Mostafavi, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 803, 802 S.E.2d 508 (2017), rev'd on other grounds, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 216 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals erred in vacating defendant's convictions for obtaining property by false pretenses because indictment describes the personal property used to obtain money, and defendant was not confused at trial regarding the property conveyed; in light of the pleading requirements set forth in the Criminal Procedure Act of 1975, the indictment did not need to include the amount of money obtained because it adequately advised defendant of the conduct that was the subject of the accusation. State v. Mostafavi, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 681</cite>, 811 S.E.2d 138 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals erred in vacating defendant's convictions for obtaining property by false pretenses because the indictment was facially valid and fulfilled the purpose of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1975 since it tracked the language of the false pretenses statute and clearly identified the conduct referenced in the accusation; the indictment described the personal property used to obtain money, the inclusion of which was sufficient to identify the specific transactions at issue. State v. Mostafavi, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 681</cite>, 811 S.E.2d 138 (2018).

       Proof of Embezzlement of Less Than Amount Charged.

         I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Purpose of Section.
   
   - This law was certainly designed to uphold the execution of public justice, by freeing the courts from those fetters of form, technicality, and refinement, which do not concern the substance of the charge, and the proof to support it. Many of the stages of the law had before called nice objections of this sort a disease of the law, and a reproach to the bench, and lamented that they were bound down to strict and precise precedents. The Legislature meant to disallow the whole of them, and only require the substance, that is a direct averment of those facts and circumstances which constitute the crime, to be set forth. It is to be remarked that the act directs the court to proceed to judgment, without regard to two things - one of the form, the other refinement. State v. Moses, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. 452</cite> (1830); State v. Hester, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 1047</cite>, 29 S.E. 380 (1898); State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 1031</cite>, 29 S.E. 381 (1898); State v. Hedgecock, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 714</cite>, 117 S.E. 47 (1923); State v. Switzer, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 88</cite>, 121 S.E. 43 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section and G.S. 15-155 were passed to forbid refinements and technicalities which, without being any aid to the innocent, brought the administration of justice into disrepute. State v. Leeper, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 655</cite>, 61 S.E. 585 (1908), overruled on other grounds, In re Alamance County Court Facilities, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 84</cite>, 405 S.E.2d 125 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was designed to free the courts from the fetters of form, technicality and refinement not concerned with the substance of the charge. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 273</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 677 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was enacted to simplify forms of indictment. State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 240</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 294 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Liberal Construction.
   
   - This section has received a very liberal construction, and its efficacy has reached and healed numerous defects in the substance as well as in the form of indictment. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 234</cite> (1869); State v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 767</cite>, 92 S.E. 373 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has received a very liberal construction. State v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 325</cite>, 77 S.E.2d 917 (1953); State v. Sparrow, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 499</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 897 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 940, 91 S. Ct. 2258, 29 L. Ed. 2d 719 (1971); State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 240</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 294 (1972); State v. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 261</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 214 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule Also Applied in Defendant's Favor.
   
   - Although the rule prohibiting reliance upon technicalities applies only against defendants, it is in accordance with the spirit of the section that it should be invoked in their favor also, for example as to the form of defendant's objection to the indictment. State v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 809</cite>, 95 S.E. 1050 (1918).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of the warrant or indictment
   
   is (1) to give the defendant notice of the charge against him to the end that he may prepare his defense and to be in a position to plead former acquittal or former conviction in the event he is again brought to trial for the same offense; (2) to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce in case of conviction. State v. Dorsett, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 227</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 15 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Purposes of Requirements as to Form of Indictments.
   
   - An indictment, whether at common law or under a statute, to be good must allege lucidly and accurately all the essential elements of the offense endeavored to be charged. The purpose of such constitutional provisions is: (1) to provide such certainty in the statement of the accusation as will identify the offense with which the accused is sought to be charged; (2) to protect the accused from being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense; (3) to enable the accused to prepare for trial; and (4) to enable the court, on conviction or plea of nolo contendere or guilty, to pronounce sentence according to the rights of the case. State v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 751</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 646 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Two Theories Alleged in Single Count.
   
   - Where, in a single count of an indictment, the State alleged two factual underpinnings for, or factual theories of, conviction for a violation of G.S. 14-230, it was not required that the State prove both; proof of only one factual theory was legally sufficient and at most placed the State at risk of failing to persuade the jury of defendant's guilt. State v. Birdsong, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 418</cite>, 384 S.E.2d 5 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment Under Private Statute.
   
   - Upon an indictment under a private statute, it is sufficient if the same is set forth by chapter and date and its material provisions incorporated in the indictment. State v. Heaton, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. 505</cite> (1877).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Holding Prisoner Where Indictment Is Defective.
   
   - Where the indictment should have been quashed because it was defective in form, the prisoner could still be held for a proper bill under this section. State v. Callett, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 563</cite>, 191 S.E. 27 (1937).
   <br />

        Flexible Pleading Standards.
   
   - Flexible pleading standards are expressed in the statutes. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 620</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 268 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain, intelligible and explicit charge is all that is now required
   
   in any criminal proceeding. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 234</cite> (1869); State v. Caylor, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 807</cite>, 101 S.E. 627 (1919). See also State v. Everhardt, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 610</cite>, 166 S.E. 738 (1932); State v. Howley, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 113</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 705 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a warrant is sufficiently intelligible and explicit to (1) inform the defendant of the charge he must answer, (2) enable him to prepare his defense, and (3) sustain the judgment, it meets the requirements of this section. State v. Sumner, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 386</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 84 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        A bill is sufficient if it charges the offense in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner, with averments sufficient to enable the court to proceed to judgment and to bar a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 273</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 677 (1972); State v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 751</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 646 (1974); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The requirements of this section are met where the indictment sets forth in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner all elements of the crime charged. State v. Page, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 232 S.E.2d 460, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 643</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 64 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides against quashal for informality if the charge be plain, intelligible, and explicit and sufficient matter appear in the bill to enable the court to proceed to judgment. State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 240</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 294 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        All that is required in a warrant or bill of indictment, since the adoption of this section, is that it be sufficient in form to express the charge against the defendant in a plain, intelligible, and explicit manner, and to contain sufficient matter to enable the court to proceed to judgment and thus bar another prosecution for the same offense. State v. Hammonds, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 226</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 133 (1954); State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 499</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 857 (1963); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        A warrant or indictment following substantially the language of the statute is sufficient if and when it thereby charges the essentials of the offense in a plain, intelligible, and explicit manner. If the statutory words fail to do this they must be supplemented by other allegations which so plainly, intelligibly and explicitly set forth every essential element of the offense as to leave no doubt in the mind of the accused and the court as to the offense intended to be charged. State v. McBane, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 913 (1969); State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 186 S.E.2d 631, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 618</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 163 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain, Intelligible, and Explicit Indictment Is Constitutional.
   
   - A bill of indictment that charges "in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner," under this section, the criminal offense the accused is "put to answer," affords the protection guaranteed by N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   22, 23. State v. Helms, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 740</cite>, 102 S.E.2d 241 (1958).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirements for a valid indictment
   
   are (1) such certainty in the statement of the accusation as will identify the offense with which the accused is sought to be charged; (2) to protect the accused from being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense; (3) to enable the accused to prepare for trial; and (4) to enable the court, on conviction or plea of nolo contendere or guilty to pronounce sentence according to the rights of the case. State v. Sparrow, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 499</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 897 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 940, 91 S. Ct. 2258, 29 L. Ed. 2d 719 (1971); State v. Hinson, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 193 S.E.2d 415 (1972), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 583</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 151, 412 U.S. 931, 93 S. Ct. 2762, 37 L. Ed. 2d 159 (1973); State v. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 261</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 214 (1973); State v. Reavis, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 199 S.E.2d 139 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment Sufficient.
   
   - Since no conclusion could be reached by reading the indictment other than that defendant was in custody at the time he allegedly committed malicious conduct by a prisoner, the trial court had jurisdiction over his case, as the State, pursuant to G.S. 15-153, adequately alleged the offense such that defendant was notified of the offense against which he was called to defend. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 622 S.E.2d 204 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 365</cite>, 630 S.E.2d 188 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment Held Insufficient.
   
   - Trial court lacked jurisdiction where the warrant charging defendant with misdemeanor disorderly conduct in a public building alleged that he caused disruption by causing a disturbance, but did not allege specific acts, and nothing suggested that defendant made or used any utterance, gesture, display, or abusive language that was intended and plainly likely to provoke violent retaliation. State v. Combs, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 774, 818 S.E.2d 642 (2018), review denied, 824 S.E.2d 408, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 240 (2019).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Aggravators Not Required to Be Alleged in Short-Form Indictment
   
   - State-court murder indictments are not required to allege the aggravating circumstances to be presented against capital defendants. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 257</cite>, 582 S.E.2d 593, cert. denied, 539 U.S. 985, 124 S. Ct. 44, 156 L. Ed. 2d 702 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of Arrest and Affidavit Constitute Warrant.
   
   - The order of arrest and the attached affidavit on which it is based are to be read and considered as a single document and together constitute a warrant. State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 179 S.E.2d 153 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirements for Valid Warrant.
   
   - A warrant meets minimum standards for validity if it (1) informed the defendant of the charge against him, (2) enabled him to prepare his defense, and (3) enabled the court to proceed to judgment and thereby barred another prosecution for the same offense. State v. Letterlough, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 169 S.E.2d 269 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A valid warrant must charge the offense with sufficient certainty to apprise the defendant of the specific accusation against him so as to enable him to prepare his defense and to protect him from a subsequent prosecution for the same offense, and to enable the court to proceed to judgment. State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 179 S.E.2d 153 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A valid warrant of arrest must be based on an examination of the complainant under oath; it must identify the person charged; it must contain directly or by proper reference at least a defective statement of the crime charged; and it must be directed to a lawful officer or to a class of officers commanding the arrest of the accused. State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 179 S.E.2d 153 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A charge must be sufficiently definite to enable the defendant to prepare his defense, to enable the court to proceed to judgment and to bar a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. This is the test of the sufficiency of a warrant as to the definiteness of its allegations. State v. Tenore, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 238</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 644 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        A warrant sufficient to inform a person of the offense with which he is charged and adequate to protect him against further prosecution for that offense is sufficient. State v. Daniel, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 717</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 704 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        A warrant and the affidavit upon which it is based will be construed together and will be tested by rules less strict than those applicable to indictments, but, nevertheless, the warrant and the affidavit together must charge facts sufficient to constitute an offense. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 312, 161 S.E.2d 198 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Defects in Warrant.
   
   - Defects in the warrant affect its validity as a basis for a criminal prosecution on the charge set forth in the affidavit as well as its validity as a basis for a legal arrest. State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 179 S.E.2d 153 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Essential Elements Must Be Set Forth.
   
   - In order to constitute a valid charge under a statute, the essential elements of the offense must be set forth in the warrant. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 312, 161 S.E.2d 198 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        A charge in a bill of indictment must be complete in itself, and contain all of the material allegations which constitute the offense charged. State v. Guffey, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 331</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 14 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an essential of jurisdiction that a criminal offense shall be sufficiently charged in the indictment. State v. Guffey, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 331</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 14 (1965).
   <br />

        Section does not dispense with requirement that essential elements of offense must be charged.

       </p>
       <p>
        Section Does Not Supply Essential Averments or Remedy Omission.
   
   - By the many adjudications construing this section it has been definitely settled that the section neither supplies nor remedies the omission of any distinct averment of any fact or circumstance which is an essential constituent of the offense charged. State v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 592</cite>, 163 S.E. 594 (1932); State v. Tarlton, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 734</cite>, 182 S.E. 481 (1935).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trend Is Not to Consider Objections Founded on Mere Matter of Form.
   
   - The trend of judicial decision and the tendency of legislation is towards the practical view that objections founded upon mere matter of form should not be considered by the courts unless there is reason to believe that a defendant has been misled by the form of the charge, or was not apprised by its terms of the nature of the offense which he was held to answer. State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 240</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 294 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonessential and Minor Defects Do Not Affect Judgment.
   
   - This section provides against quashal for mere informality or refinement, and judgments are no longer stayed or reversed for nonessential or minor defects. State v. Davenport, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 475</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 686 (1947).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Approved Forms Should Be Followed.
   
   - This section was enacted to prevent miscarriage of justice, but not to encourage prosecuting officers to try experiments with new forms, or to excuse them from the duty of ascertaining and following those which have been approved by long use or by statute. The object of the statute in disregarding refinements and informalities is to secure trials upon the merits, and solicitors (now district attorneys) will best serve that end by observing approved forms so as not to raise unnecessary questions as to what are refinements and informalities and what are indispensable allegations. State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 1031</cite>, 29 S.E. 381 (1898); State v. Marsh, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 1000</cite>, 43 S.E. 828 (1903); State v. Hammonds, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 226</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 133 (1954); State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 240</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 294 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecuting officers should ordinarily follow approved forms in drafting bills of indictment so as to avoid raising questions unnecessarily as to what are refinements and what are essential allegations. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 273</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 677 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Incorporation of Essential Information by Reference.
   
   - Reference in the second count of an indictment for forgery and for uttering a bad check to the first count, wherein the check was fully described, was sufficient to incorporate by reference essential information necessary to sustain the second count. State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 240</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 294 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Identity of Accused.
   
   - For an indictment to be valid, the name of the accused must be alleged in a manner sufficient to identify him with certainty. State v. Bagnard, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 211 S.E.2d 471 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictments and warrants need only allege the ultimate facts
   
   constituting each element of the criminal offense. Evidentiary matters need not be alleged. State v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 633</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 406 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidentiary matters are not required to be alleged
   
   in a bill of indictment. State v. Rankin, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 286 S.E.2d 119, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 590</cite>, 292 S.E.2d 11 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of abbreviations
   
   in warrants and indictments is not to be encouraged. State v. Letterlough, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 169 S.E.2d 269 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Means by Which Accused Aided and Abetted.
   
   - An indictment need not set forth the specific facts or means by which an accused aided and abetted in the commission of a crime. State v. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 261</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 214 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of uniform traffic ticket as a warrant should not be encouraged.
   
   This form lacks that degree of clarity desirable in a warrant which should "express the charge against the defendant in a plain, intelligible, and explicit manner." State v. Letterlough, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 169 S.E.2d 269 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Endorsement by Grand Jury Unnecessary.
   
   - No endorsement on a bill of indictment by the grand jury is necessary. The record that it was presented by the grand jury is sufficient in the absence of evidence to impeach it. State v. Sultan, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 569</cite>, 54 S.E. 841 (1906), overruling State v. McBroom, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 528</cite>, 37 S.E. 193 (1900); State v.

        Indictment in Language of Statute.
   
   - An indictment following substantially the language of the statute is sufficient only when it thereby charges the essential elements of the offense in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner. If the statutory words fail to do this, they must be supplemented in the indictment by other allegations which explicitly and accurately set forth every essential element of the offense with such exactitude as to leave no doubt in the minds of the accused and the court as to the specific offense intended to be charged. State v. Eason, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 59</cite>, 86 S.E.2d 774 (1955); State v. Jordan, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 253</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 497 (1957); State v. Sossamon, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 374</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 638 (1963); State v. Lackey, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 171</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 465 (1967); State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 728</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 820 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule in this State and elsewhere is that an indictment for a statutory offense is sufficient, if the offense is charged in the words of the statute, either literally or substantially, or in equivalent words. This rule does not apply where the words of the statute do not, without uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the essential elements necessary to constitute the offense sought to be charged in the indictment. In such a situation the statutory words must be supplemented in the indictment by other allegations which explicitly and accurately set forth every essential element of the offense with such exactitude as to leave no doubt in the minds of the accused and the court as to the specific offense intended to be charged. State v. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 261</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 214 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a criminal prosecution for a statutory offense, including the violation of a municipal ordinance, the warrant or indictment is sufficient if and when it follows the language of the statute or ordinance and thereby charges the essentials of the offense "in a plain, intelligible, and explicit manner." If the words of the statute fail to do this they must be supplemented by other allegations which so plainly, intelligibly and explicitly set forth every essential element of the offense as to leave no doubt in the mind of the accused and the court as to the offense intended to be charged. State v. Dorsett, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 227</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 15 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an indictment follows the words of a statute it is sufficient under this section. State v. Harrison, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 408</cite>, 59 S.E. 867 (1907); State v. Lepeer, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 655</cite>, 61 S.E. 585 (1908), overruled on other grounds, In re Alamance County Court Facilities, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 84</cite>, 405 S.E.2d 125 (1991). See also State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 47</cite>, 164 S.E. 732, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 327</cite>, 166 S.E. 297, 287 U.S. 645, 53 S. Ct. 91, 77 L. Ed. 558 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, an indictment for a statutory offense is sufficient if the offense is charged in the words of the statute. State v. Sparrow, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 499</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 897 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 940, 91 S. Ct. 2258, 29 L. Ed. 2d 719 (1971); State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment couched in the language of the statute is generally sufficient to charge the statutory offense. State v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 633</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 406 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's indictment was not facially invalid because it tracked the relevant language of the felony speeding to elude arrest statute, G.S. 20-141.5, and listed the essential elements of the offense; the body of the indictment provided defendant with enough information to prepare a defense for the offense of felony speeding to elude arrest with reckless driving as an aggravating factor. State v. Leonard, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 711 S.E.2d 867 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's indictment included the critical language found in the statute, alleging that he failed to meet his obligation to report, and this language was consistent with that found in the charging statute and provided defendant sufficient notice to prepare a defense; additional detail about the reporting requirement was neither needed nor required, and thus the indictment was valid and conferred jurisdiction upon the trial court. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 620</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 268 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment for offense created by statute must be framed upon the statute,
   
   and this fact must distinctly appear upon the face of the indictment itself; and in order that it shall so appear, the bill must either charge the offense in the language of the act or specifically set forth the facts constituting the same. State v. Gibbs, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 259</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 883 (1951).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But it is not necessary to charge in the precise words of a statute.
   
   Under this section, every criminal proceeding by warrant is sufficient for all intents and purposes if it expresses the charge in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner. State v. Bigelow, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 199 S.E.2d 494 (1973).
   <br />

       </p>
       <p>
        Reference to a specific statute upon which the charge in a warrant is laid is not necessary to its validity. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 499</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 857 (1963); State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 714</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 890 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Warrant Avers Facts Constituting Every Element of Offense.
   
   - If a warrant avers facts which constitute every element of an offense, it is not necessary that it be couched in the language of the statute. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 499</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 857 (1963); State v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 356 S.E.2d 595 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Charge in General Terms of Breach of Statute Not Sufficient.
   
   - Merely charging in general terms a breach of the statute and referring to it in the indictment is not sufficient. State v. Sossamon, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 374</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 638 (1963); State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 728</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 820 (1968); State v.

       <p>
        Reference to Statute That Is Not Pertinent.
   
   - Where a warrant charges a criminal offense but refers to a statute that is not pertinent, such reference does not invalidate the warrant. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 499</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 857 (1963).

        Substance of Indictment May Not Be Amended.
   
   - The substance of a bill of indictment used in a trial may not be amended by the court or the solicitor (now district attorney) after it has been returned by the grand jury as a true bill. State v. Haigler, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 188 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 625</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 468 (1972).
   <br />

       <p>
        Fatal Defect Cannot Be Cured by Amendment.
   
   - Where a warrant or indictment is fatally defective in failing to charge an essential element of the offense, the defect cannot be cured by amendment. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 312, 161 S.E.2d 198 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion to Quash Tests Sufficiency of Warrant.
   
   - A motion to quash is a proper method of testing the sufficiency of the warrant to charge a criminal offense; it is not a means of testing the guilt or innocence of the defendant with respect to a crime properly charged. State v. Tenore, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 238</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 644 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        It Lies Only for Defect Appearing on Face.
   
   - While a motion to quash is an appropriate method of testing the sufficiency of the bill of indictment to charge a criminal offense, it lies only for a defect appearing on the face of the warrant or indictment. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Defect Cannot Be Established by Evidence Outside the Record.
   
   - The court, in ruling on a motion to quash an indictment is not permitted to consider extraneous evidence; therefore, when the defect must be established by evidence outside the record, the motion must be denied. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Quashing indictments is not favored.
   
   It releases recognizances and sets the defendant at large where, it may be, he ought to be held to answer upon a better indictment, though allowable, where it will put an end to the prosecution altogether, and advisable where it appears that the court has not jurisdiction, or where the matter charged is not indictable in any form. It is, therefore, a general rule that no indictment which charges the higher offenses, as treason or felony or those crimes which immediately affect the public at large, as perjury, forgery, etc., will be thus summarily dealt with. The example is a bad one, and the effect upon the public injurious, to allow the defendant to escape upon matters of form. State v. Colbert, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 368</cite> (1876); State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 240</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 294 (1972). See State v. Flowers, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 841</cite>, 13 S.E. 718 (1891).

       <p>
        Quashing of indictments is not favored where they do not affect the merits of the case. State v. Swift, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 383</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 652 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion to Quash Denied Where Essential Elements Present.
   
   - Where the bills of indictment contained allegations sufficient to set forth fully and clearly all essential elements of the offense charged, denial of defendant's motion to quash on the ground that the bills were "too vague and insufficient, too broad and general" was proper. State v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 211 S.E.2d 542 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        A warrant which, stripped of nonessential words, charges defendant with a crime, is sufficient to survive a motion to quash. State v. Camel, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 426</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 313 (1949).

        Indictment Not Quashed for Mere Informality or Minor Defects.
   
   - In light of the provisions of this section, it is the practice of the Supreme Court not to sustain motions to quash bills of indictment for mere informality or minor defects which do not affect the merits of the case. State v. Brady, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 675</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 791 (1953).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion to quash for redundancy in the affidavit portion of a warrant
   
   upon which the order of arrest portion is based is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 179 S.E.2d 153 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion to Quash Addressed to Court's Discretion.
   
   - A motion to quash for redundancy or inartificiality is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 13</cite>, 164 S.E. 737, cert. denied, 287 U.S. 649, 53 S. Ct. 95, 77 L. Ed. 561 (1932); State v. Davenport, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 475</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 686 (1947).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Grounds for Motion in Arrest of Judgment.
   
   - A motion in arrest of judgment after conviction, on the ground that the bill of indictment is defective, will not be granted unless it appears that the bill is so defective that judgment cannot be pronounced upon it. State v. Francis, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 612</cite>, 72 S.E. 1041 (1911); State v. Ratliff, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 707</cite>, 86 S.E. 997 (1915); State v. Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 810</cite>, 130 S.E. 848 (1925).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Not Granted Where Court Enabled to Proceed to Judgment.
   
   - Where sufficient matter appears on the face of a bill of indictment to enable the court to proceed to judgment, an arrest of judgment is forbidden by this section. State v. Darden, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 697</cite>, 23 S.E. 106 (1895).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Error or Defect Must Appear on Face of Record.
   
   - A judgment may be arrested only for some error or defect appearing on the face of the record. State v. Eason, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 59</cite>, 86 S.E.2d 774 (1955).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion for Bill of Particulars as Prerequisite to Arrest of Judgment.
   
   - Where the defendant thinks an indictment fails to impart information sufficiently specific as to the nature of the charge he may, before trial, move the court to order that a bill of particulars be filed, and the court will not arrest the judgment after verdict where he attempts to reserve his fire until he takes first the chance of acquittal. State v. Tessnear, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 211</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 393 (1961).

        Superfluous Words Disregarded.
   
   - The use of superfluous words in a bill of indictment will be disregarded. State v. Guest, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. 410</cite>, 6 S.E. 253 (1888); State v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 861</cite>, 11 S.E.2d 990 (1890); State v. Darden, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 697</cite>, 23 S.E. 106 (1895); State v.

       <p>
        Nonessential Allegations May Be Treated as Surplusage.
   
   - Allegations beyond the essential elements of the crime sought to be charged are irrelevant and may be treated as surplusage. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 273</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 677 (1972).

       </p>
       <p>
        Inadvertent Omissions.
   
   - The inadvertent omission of words not affecting the substance of the charge or prejudicing the defendant is not fatal. State v. Burke, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 750</cite>, 12 S.E. 1000 (1891), and cases there cited; State v. Ratliff, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 707</cite>, 86 S.E. 997 (1915).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Omission in Complaint of Name of Person Charged.
   
   - The omission of the name of the party in the complaint, against whom a criminal offense is charged, will not of itself invalidate the indictment, when the warrant of arrest thereto attached and referred to contains his name and clearly indicates him as the person charged, the complaint and warrant being read together, and in this way they are sufficient in form to proceed to judgment upon conviction. State v. Poythress, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 809</cite>, 93 S.E. 919 (1917).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Omission of Defendant's Name from Affidavit.
   
   - Where defendant's name appears in the warrant which refers to the affidavit, forming a part thereof, the omission of defendant's name from the affidavit is not a fatal defect. However, an affidavit form which fails to name the person charged is disapproved. State v. St. Clair, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 183</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 840, modified, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 228</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 493 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Omission of Caption.
   
   - The omission of the caption of a bill of indictment does not constitute ground for arrest of judgment. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 117</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 623 (1945).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Omission in Describing a Lease.
   
   - In describing a lease the omission of the word "year" after the word "one," is one of the informalities cured by this section. State v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 541</cite> (1882).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Repeat Names in Charging Scienter.
   
   - Where defendants contended that a court in the indictment charging receiving stolen goods was fatally defective in that the names of defendants were not repeated in charging scienter, the defect was merely an informality or refinement not sufficient to support a quashal of the indictment, the charge being plain, explicit and sufficient to enable the court to proceed to judgment. State v. Whitley, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 661</cite>, 182 S.E. 338 (1935).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Foreman's Failure to Sign Bill.
   
   - The report of the grand jury, signed by the foreman, in which was listed the bill against defendant as having been returned a true bill charging a noncapital felony, rendered the foreman's failure to sign the bill itself amendable, and defendant's motion to quash the indictment was properly denied. State v. Spinks, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 548, 211 S.E.2d 476 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The omission of a signature on one of the bills of indictment did not affect the substance of the bill where the other four bills were properly signed on the same day; therefore, the trial court did not err in amending the bill of indictment by adding the signature of the grand jury foreman. State v. Colvin, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 374 S.E.2d 126 (1988), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 249</cite>, 377 S.E.2d 758 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Name of Court Incorrect.
   
   - Describing the court in which the false oath is alleged to have been taken as "before Joseph Z. Pratt, a justice of the peace, in and for said county," instead of as "a court of a justice of the peace for township A, of Chowan County," is not a substantial variance from the true description and is cured by this section. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. 495</cite> (1873).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Error in Name of Accused.
   
   - Where, in the order of arrest portion of the purported warrant, the person ordered arrested was "Dempsey Roy Smith" and not the defendant, "Dempsey Roy Powell," the instrument did not meet the requirement that it be directed to a lawful officer commanding the arrest of the accused. State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 179 S.E.2d 153 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill of indictment identifying the accused in the body thereof as "John Doe AKA 'Varne' " was insufficient to charge a defendant named "Vaughn Bagnard" with any offense. State v. Bagnard, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 211 S.E.2d 471 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Wrong County in Caption.
   
   - A misrecital of the proper county in the caption of an indictment furnishes no ground for arrest of judgment, and it seems that such an indictment would have been sufficient even before this section was adopted. State v. Sprinkle, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 463</cite> (1871); State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 117</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 623 (1945).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Incorrect Spelling.
   
   - Charging that one committed a crime in the "count aforesaid" instead of "county aforesaid" is an informality which is cured by this section. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 234</cite> (1869); State v. Evans, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. 40</cite> (1873).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Singular Rather Than Plural in Joint Indictment.
   
   - In a joint indictment of two defendants for murder which charged that defendants "of his malice aforethought" committed the act, the use of the word "his" instead of "their" is insufficient ground for arresting the judgment, informalities and refinements being disregarded if the indictment is sufficient to inform defendants of the charge against them and to enable them to prepare their defense, and to protect them from another prosecution. State v. Linney, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 739</cite>, 194 S.E. 470 (1938).

        Purpose of the rule as to variance
   
   in an indictment is to avoid surprise and to protect the accused from another prosecution for the same offense. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 17, 222 S.E.2d 718, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 96</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 325 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance Must Be Material to Be Fatal.
   
   - Under this section, a variance, to be fatal, must be substantial and material. State v. Ridge, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 655</cite>, 34 S.E. 439 (1899).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Names of Parties.
   
   - Where the indictment charged an assault, etc., upon "Lila" Hatcher, and the evidence tended to show that it was made upon "Liza" Hatcher, the variance is immaterial. State v. Drakeford, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. 667</cite>, 78 S.E. 308 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where indictment alleged that Thomas R. Robertson was defendant, and the proof was that "Thomas Robertson" was the defendant in said action and there was evidence of the identity of Thomas Robertson and Thomas R. Robertson, this is an informality cured by the section. State v. Hester, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 1047</cite>, 29 S.E. 380 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in an indictment for murder, the assault is charged to have been made on one "N.S. Jarrett," and in subsequent parts of the indictment he is described as "Nimrod S. Jarrett," there is no variance. State v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. 348</cite> (1873).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the bill of indictment alleges a sale of narcotics to one person and the proof tends to show only a sale to a different person, the variance is fatal. State v. Ingram, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 201 S.E.2d 532 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Name of Article Stolen.
   
   - In an indictment for larceny, when the article stolen is described as a "calf" skin and is proven on the trial to be a "kip" skin, there is no variance between the allegation and the proof. State v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 261</cite> (1877).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Object Used in Commission of Assault.
   
   - Evidence that defendant committed the assault with a "brick or a rock or what" was not fatal variance with a warrant charging that the assault was committed with a brick, the evidence being sufficient to justify the jury in inferring that the assault was committed with a brick as charged, and there being no element of surprise in the evidence, especially where defendant's defense was that of an alibi. State v. Hobbs, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 14</cite>, 3 S.E.2d 431 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Number of Victims.
   
   - In a prosecution for armed robbery, where the indictment referred only to the robbery of a single victim but the trial judge in his charge to the jury referred to another victim, there was no prejudicial variance since there was only a single criminal transaction, and defendant therefore was in no danger of a subsequent prosecution for the robbery of the other victim. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 17, 222 S.E.2d 718, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 96</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 325 (1976).

       <p>
        When Use of Disjunctive Constitutes Fatal Defect.
   
   - Whether the improper use of the disjunctive constitutes a fatal defect in an indictment, or simply poor pleading, depends upon whether such use renders the indictment uncertain. State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 186 S.E.2d 631, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 618</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 163 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Duplicity in Indictment.
   
   - By going to trial without making a motion to quash, defendant waived any duplicity that might have existed in the bill of indictment. State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 186 S.E.2d 631, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 618</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 163 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment should not charge a party disjunctively or alternatively,
   
   in such a manner as to leave it uncertain what is relied on as the accusation against him. State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 186 S.E.2d 631, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 618</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 163 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Alternative Allegation of Offenses.
   
   - Two or more offenses cannot, in the absence of statutory permission, be alleged alternatively in the same count. State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 186 S.E.2d 631, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 618</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 163 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Alternative Pleading as to How Offense Committed.
   
   - Where a statute specifies several means or ways in which an offense may be committed in the alternative, it is bad pleading to allege such means or ways in the alternative; the proper way is to connect the various allegations in the accusing pleading with the conjunctive term "and" not with the word "or." State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 186 S.E.2d 631, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 618</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 163 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an indictment it is always the better practice to use the conjunctive "and" rather than the disjunctive "or" where a statute sets forth disjunctively several means or ways by which an offense may be committed. State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 186 S.E.2d 631, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 618</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 163 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Offense Not Charged in Alternative.
   
   - An indictment charging that defendant did unlawfully and willfully build or install a septic tank, without procuring a permit and having the tank inspected as required by law, should not be quashed on the ground that the offense charged is alleged in the alternative, since the words "build" and "install" in the sense in which they were used in the ordinance, the violation of which is alleged in the indictment, are synonymous. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 563</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 129 (1955).

        Description of Property in Indictment for Larceny.
   
   - The description in an indictment must be in the common and ordinary acceptation of property and with certainty sufficient to enable the jury to say that the article proved to be stolen is the same, and to enable the court to see that it is the subject of larceny and also to protect the defendant in any subsequent prosecution for the same offense. State v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 261</cite> (1877); State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 672</cite> (1880); State v. Caylor, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 807</cite>, 101 S.E. 627 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        The description of the property alleged to have been stolen must be of sufficient certainty to enable the jury to say that the article proved to be stolen is the same. State v. Haigler, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 188 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 625</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 468 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The description in a warrant or bill of indictment of the goods alleged to have been stolen is sufficient if from it defendant can have a fair and reasonable opportunity to prepare his defense, can avail himself of his conviction or acquittal as a bar to subsequent prosecution for the same offense, and the court is enabled, on conviction, to pronounce sentence according to law. State v. Fuller, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 185 S.E.2d 312 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The description of property alleged to have been stolen must be plain and intelligible, and must correspond to the different forms of existence in which the same article is found. In its raw or unmanufactured state it may be described by its ordinary name, but if it be worked up into some other forms, etc., when stolen, it must be described by the name by which it is generally known. State v. Haigler, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 188 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 625</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 468 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Object of describing property stolen by its usual name, ownership, etc.,
   
   is to enable the defendant to make his defense, and to protect himself against a second conviction. State v. Haigler, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 188 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 625</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 468 (1972).

        Object of describing property stolen by its quality and quantity
   
   is that it may appear to the court to be of value. State v. Haigler, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 188 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 625</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 468 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment for burglary need not describe the property stolen
   
   by the burglar. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 431</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 217 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment for burglary must specify the particular felony
   
   which the defendant is alleged to have intended to commit at the time of the breaking and entering, and it is not sufficient to charge generally an intent to commit an unspecified felony. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Felony Intended Need Not Be Set Out as Specifically.
   
   - In an indictment for burglary, the felony intended need not be set out as fully and specifically as would be required in an indictment for the actual commission of that felony. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In specifying the felony intended in an indictment for burglary it is enough to state the offense generally and to designate it by name. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Identifying Premises Entered in Burglary Indictment.
   
   - An indictment for burglary is fatally defective if it fails to identify the premises broken into and entered with sufficient certainty to enable the defendant to prepare his defense and to offer him protection from another prosecution for the same incident. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 431</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 217 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Ownership of Property in Indictment for Arson.
   
   - In a prosecution under G.S. 14-65, an indictment stating that the defendant procured another to burn a certain house owned by the defendant and another as tenants in common is sufficient, and the fact that the same parties owned other houses in like capacity is not ground for demurrer or quashal. State v. McKeithan, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 494</cite>, 166 S.E. 336 (1932).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prerequisites of affidavit portion of warrant charging the offense of resisting arrest
   
   are set forth in State v. Wiggs, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 507</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 84 (1967) and State v. Fenner, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 694</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 349 (1965); State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 179 S.E.2d 153 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the prerequisites of the affidavit portion of a warrant properly charging the offense of resisting arrest is that the affidavit upon which the order of arrest is based shall identify by name the person alleged to have been resisted, delayed or obstructed, and describe his official character with sufficient certainty to show that he was a public officer within the purview of the statute. State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 179 S.E.2d 153 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment for Resisting Arrest.
   
   - A motion in arrest of judgment should have been granted where indictment for resisting a public officer failed to identify the public officer and did not point out even in a general way the manner in which the defendant resisted. State v. Eason, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 59</cite>, 86 S.E.2d 774 (1955).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Deadly Weapon.
   
   - It is sufficient for indictments or warrants seeking to charge a crime in which one of the elements is the use of a deadly weapon (1) to name the weapon and (2) either to state expressly that the weapon used was a "deadly weapon" or to allege such facts as would necessarily demonstrate the deadly character of the weapon. State v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 633</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 406 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Driving While License Suspended or Revoked.
   
   - Where a warrant does not charge that defendant operated a motor vehicle on a public highway, such warrant fails to allege an essential element of the offense as defined in G.S. 20-28(a). State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 728</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 820 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Drunkenness.
   
   - A warrant charging that defendant did "unlawfully and willfully appear off of his premises in a drunken condition" is insufficient to charge the offense of public drunkenness proscribed by former G.S. 14-335 (see now G.S. 14-444), since it fails to charge that defendant was in a public place. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 312, 161 S.E.2d 198 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Receipt of Official Ballots.
   
   - A charge of the receipt by defendant of official ballots, knowing that he had no legal right to them, amounts to a charge of interference with the duty of the county board of elections to safely keep the ballots until time for delivery to the registrars (now chief judge), within the provisions of this section, and the bill of indictment should not have been quashed because it failed to charge the manner in which the election officials were interfered with. State v. Abernethy, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 226</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 25 (1941).

     <p>
      No judgment upon any indictment for felony or misdemeanor, whether after verdict, or by confession, or otherwise, shall be stayed or reversed for the want of the averment of any matter unnecessary to be proved, nor for omission of the words "as appears by the record," or of the words "with force and arms," nor for the insertion of the words "against the form of the statutes" instead of the words "against the form of the statute," or vice versa; nor for omission of the words "against the form of the statute" or "against the form of the statutes," nor for omitting to state the time at which the offense was committed in any case where time is not of the essence of the offense, nor for stating the time imperfectly, nor for stating the offense to have been committed on a day subsequent to the finding of the indictment, or on an impossible day, or on a day that never happened; nor for want of a proper and perfect venue, when the court shall appear by the indictment to have had jurisdiction of the offense.

       </h5>
       <p>
        One purpose of an indictment
   
   is to give the defendant notice of the charge against him to the end that he may prepare a defense and be in a position to plead double jeopardy if he is again brought to trial for the same offense. Another purpose is to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce in case of conviction. State v. Sills, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 370</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 379 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Section Cures Formal Defects.
   
   - This section is intended to cure only formal defects in the indictment after judgment, and not omissions of averments necessary to enable the court to give judgment intelligently. State v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 120</cite> (1872).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect on Common Law Technicalities.
   
   - The refined technicalities of the procedure at common law, in both civil and criminal cases, have almost entirely, if not quite, been abolished by the statute. State v. Hedgecock, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 714</cite>, 117 S.E. 47 (1923).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Modern tendency is against technical objections
   
   which do not affect the merits of the case. Hence judgments are not to be stayed or reversed for nonessential or minor defects. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 771</cite>, 182 S.E. 643 (1935).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Essential Elements Must Still Be Charged.
   
   - Nothing in G.S. 15-153 or in this section dispenses with the requirement that the essential elements of the offense must be charged. State v. Sossamon, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 374</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 638 (1963); State v. McBane, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 913 (1969); State v. King, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 305</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 667 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of the rule as to variance in an indictment
   
   is to avoid surprise and to protect the accused from another prosecution for the same offense. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 17, 222 S.E.2d 718, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 96</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 325 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance Raised by Motion for Judgment of Nonsuit.
   
   - A fatal variance between the indictment and the proof is properly raised by motion for judgment of nonsuit. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of G.S.
   
   15-144.1 do not prevail over this section. State v. Sills, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 370</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 379 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Charge in Warrant Different from That in Indictment.
   
   - Where an arrest warrant listed a different charge from that subsequently returned in the indictment did not require that the judge dismiss the latter. State v. Riggs, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 394 S.E.2d 670 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Substance of Indictment May Not Be Amended.
   
   - The substance of a bill of indictment used in a trial may not be amended by the court or the solicitor (now district attorney) after it has been returned by the grand jury as a true bill. State v. Haigler, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 188 S.E.2d 586, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 625</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 468 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Words "with force and arms"
   
   constitute a formal phrase traditionally included in bills of indictment, but have no significance as an element of the specific crime charged in the bill of indictment. State v. Acrey, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 90</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 201 (1964); State v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 211 S.E.2d 542 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        G.S. 15-144 does not prevail over the language of this section, and the omission of the phrase "with force and arms" does not, therefore, render a defendant's indictment for murder fatally defective. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 676</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 579 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction with G.S. 15-144.1 as to "with Force and Arms".
   
   - This section does not either require the averment "with force and arms" or express a legislative intent that the language in G.S. 15-144.1(a) prevail over the express language in this section, which states in effect that no judgment shall be stayed or reversed because of the omission of the words "with force and arms" from the indictment. State v. Corbett, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 169</cite>, 297 S.E.2d 553 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment in a rape case under G.S. 15-144.1 need not contain the phrase "with force and arms." State v. Cheek, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 552</cite>, 299 S.E.2d 633 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment concluding against the "force" instead of the "form" of the statute
   
   is sufficient under this section. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 385</cite> (1879).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment concluding against the form of the "statue" instead of "statute"
   
   is not ground for an arrest of judgment. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 234</cite> (1869).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Omissions Held Not Fatal.
   
   - Omitting the statement, that the "prisoner, not having the fear of God before his eyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigations of the devil," and the further omission of an averment that the "deceased was in the peace of God and the State," are not fatal defects. State v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 772</cite> (1885).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion Simplified.
   
   - The formal conclusion, "against the peace and dignity of the State," and "against the form of the statute," etc., are not necessary in an indictment for any offense whatever, but are mere surplusage. State v. Sykes, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 694</cite>, 10 S.E. 191 (1889); State v. Kirkman, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 911</cite>, 10 S.E. 312 (1889), overruling State v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. 534</cite> (1879); State v. Peters, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 876</cite>, 12 S.E. 74 (1890); State v. Dudley, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 822</cite>, 109 S.E. 63 (1921).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Locality May Be Omitted.
   
   - Formerly failure to allege and prove the locality, appropriate to the forum, was fatal, because essential to the jurisdiction, both in civil and criminal actions, but this has been wisely reversed by this section. State v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 670</cite>, 57 S.E. 349 (1907).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance in Description of Locality.
   
   - Where an indictment alleges the particular place where an act took place, and such allegation is not descriptive of the offense, and is not required to be proved as laid in order to show the court's jurisdiction, a variance which does not mislead accused or expose him to double jeopardy is not material. State v. Currie, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 446, 267 S.E.2d 390, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980), overruled on other grounds, State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 871 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Challenge to Jurisdiction in Plea in Abatement.
   
   - Where the jurisdiction of the court is not ousted on the face of the indictment the position that the court does not have jurisdiction is not available on a plea in abatement. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 13</cite>, 164 S.E. 737, cert. denied, 287 U.S. 649, 53 S. Ct. 95, 77 L. Ed. 561 (1932).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Incorrect Venue.
   
   - Even if trafficking indictment failed to name Wake County as a county in which the offense occurred, and venue was therefore technically incorrect in Wake County, the Superior Court of Wake County nevertheless had jurisdiction to try the offense, as under G.S. 15A-631 the return of an indictment is a matter of venue, not jurisdiction. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 611, 386 S.E.2d 620 (1989), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 365</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 817 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Later Indictment for Same Offense Where Time Not of the Essence.
   
   - While an appeal from conviction in a recorder's court upon a warrant, charging unlawful possession on a certain date of intoxicating liquors for the purpose of sale, was pending in the superior court, that court had jurisdiction to try defendant on a bill of indictment of a later date charging the same offense, where the record contains nothing to show that the offenses are identical. Time is not of the essence and need not be specified in the indictment. State v. Suddreth, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 610</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 623 (1943).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance as to Identity of Victim of Armed Robbery.
   
   - In a prosecution for armed robbery, where the indictment referred only to the robbery of a single victim but the trial judge in his charge to the jury referred to another victim, there was no prejudicial variance since there was only a single criminal transaction, and defendant therefore was in no danger of a subsequent prosecution for the robbery of the other victim. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 17, 222 S.E.2d 718, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 96</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 325 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment of Description of Stolen Property Did Not Invalidate Breaking and Entering Count.
   
   - An amendment by the solicitor (now district attorney) of the description of the stolen property in felonious larceny and receiving counts of an indictment, if error, did not invalidate a count charging felonious breaking and entering, and was not prejudicial where the only sentence imposed was for breaking and entering. State v. Haigler, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 188 S.E.2d 586 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance as to Whom Narcotics Were Sold.
   
   - Where the bill of indictment alleges a sale of narcotics to one person and the proof tends to show only a sale to a different person, the variance is fatal. State v. Ingram, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 201 S.E.2d 532 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Lack of Evidence as to Alleged Serial Number of Stolen Goods.
   
   - Where a larceny indictment describes the stolen property as "a 1970 Plymouth, Serial # PM14360F239110, the personal property of George Edison Biggs," and the evidence shows the taking by defendant of a 1970 Plymouth which was owned by George Edison Biggs but there is no evidence as to the serial number, the variance is not fatal. State v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 211 S.E.2d 542 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance as to Custody from Which Defendant Escaped.
   
   - Where bill of indictment charges that defendant escaped while lawfully confined in the North Carolina State Prison System in the lawful custody of the North Carolina Department of Correction, and the evidence shows he escaped while assigned by an official of the Department of Correction to work under an employee of the State Highway Commission, the variance is not fatal. State v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 211 S.E.2d 542 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Short-form Indictment Held Sufficient.
   
   - Short-form indictment expressly alleging murder in the first-degree met the requirements of G.S. 15-155. State v. Maske, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 40</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 521 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>

         II. TIME OF OFFENSE.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Failure to Charge Any Date.
   
   - Where time is not of the essence of a crime, the omission to charge any date is immaterial by this section, though the allegation of time can do no harm. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 601</cite> (1880); State v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 861</cite>, 11 S.E. 990 (1890); State v. Peters, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 876</cite>, 12 S.E. 74 (1890); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 753</cite>, 23 S.E. 250 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        When time is not of the essence of the offense charged, an indictment may not be quashed for failure to allege the specific date on which the crime was committed. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 596</cite>, 313 S.E.2d 556 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to accurately state the date or time an offense is alleged to have occurred
   
   does not invalidate a bill of indictment, nor does it justify reversal of a conviction obtained thereon. State v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 349 S.E.2d 327 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A judgment for burglary was not arrested because the indictment imperfectly referred to the hour of midnight as 12:00 a.m. State v. Mandina, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 373 S.E.2d 155 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A child's uncertainty as to the time or particular day when the offense charged was committed
   
   shall not be grounds for nonsuit where there is sufficient evidence that the defendant committed each essential act of the offense. State v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 84</cite>, 352 S.E.2d 424 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance as to time is not material where no statute of limitations is involved.
   
   State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 107</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 664 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance Between Date on Indictment and Date Proved Not Prejudicial.
   
   - Where defendant's evidence showed that he did not participate in the crimes and, had this evidence been believed by the jury, would have entitled defendant to acquittal, the variance between the date listed on the indictment and the time of the offense as proved at trial was not prejudicial to defendant, and did not deprive him of an opportunity to present his defense. State v. Riggs, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 394 S.E.2d 670 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Variance Between Time Alleged and Time Proved Not Usually Fatal.
   
   - Where time is not of the essence of the offense and the statute of limitations is not involved, a discrepancy between the date alleged in the indictment and the date shown by the State's evidence is ordinarily not fatal. State v. Lemmond, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 182 S.E.2d 636 (1971); State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 236 S.E.2d 376, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 363</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 851 (1977); State v. Currie, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 446, 267 S.E.2d 390, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980); State v. Christopher, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 788, 295 S.E.2d 487, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 645</cite>, 300 S.E.2d 381 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The time named in a bill of indictment is not usually an essential ingredient of the crime charged, and the State may prove that it was in fact committed on some other date. State v. Whittemore, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 583</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 396 (1961); State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 373</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 801 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State may prove that an offense charged was committed on some date other than the time named in the bill of indictment. A variance as to time, however, becomes material and of the essence when it deprives a defendant of an opportunity to adequately present his defense. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 596</cite>, 313 S.E.2d 556 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, the date alleged in the indictment is neither an essential nor a substantial fact, and therefore the State may prove that the offense was actually committed on some date other than that alleged in the indictment without the necessity of a motion to change the bill. State v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 349 S.E.2d 327 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But May Not Be Used to Deprive Defendant of His Defense.
   
   - This salutary rule, preventing a defendant who does not rely on time as a defense from using a discrepancy between the time named in the bill and the time shown by the evidence for the State, cannot be used to ensnare a defendant and thereby deprive him of an opportunity to adequately present his defense. State v. Whittemore, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 583</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 396 (1961); State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 373</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 801 (1965); State v. Lemmond, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 182 S.E.2d 636 (1971); State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 236 S.E.2d 376, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 363</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 851 (1977); State v. Currie, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 446, 267 S.E.2d 390, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980); State v. Christopher, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 788, 295 S.E.2d 487, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 645</cite>, 300 S.E.2d 381 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        As Where He Relies upon Alibi.
   
   State v. Lemmond, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 182 S.E.2d 636 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a defendant relies upon a defense of alibi, time becomes essential. State v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 349 S.E.2d 327 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Time is not of the essence of carrying a concealed weapon,
   
   and it may be shown at a previous time to that alleged in the bill. State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 765</cite>, 117 S.E. 803 (1923).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Felonious Assault.
   
   - There was no fatal variance between an indictment charging that the date of a felonious assault was April 17, 1979, and evidence that the assault occurred on February 17, 1979, where the variance was caused by a clerical mistake in the indictment; the statute of limitations was not involved; all of the evidence at trial concerned an incident on February 17; defense counsel's questioning of the witnesses clearly indicates that he was aware of the clerical error before trial; and defendant was not prejudiced in his preparation of an adequate defense by the variance. State v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 377, 271 S.E.2d 752 (1980), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 723</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 288 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Receiving Stolen Goods.
   
   - When time is not of the essence of the offense, leaving out the date does not make the bill of indictment defective, and the crime of receiving stolen goods is not one of the offenses in which time is of the essence. State v. Tessnear, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 211</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 393 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Breaking or Entering.
   
   - Indictment alleging violation of G.S. 14-54 "on or about the . . . day of June, A.D. 1956" was not fatally defective. Time not being of the essence of the offense charged, it was not necessary that the exact date be specified. State v. Andrews, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 561</cite>, 99 S.E.2d 745 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Rape.
   
   - It is to the girl's first act of intercourse with a man when she is under 16 (now 13) years of age, that the law attaches criminality on the part of the man, and a variance between allegation and proof as to time is not material where no statute of limitations is involved. State v. Trippe, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 600</cite>, 24 S.E.2d 340 (1943).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Unlawfully Withholding Credit Card.
   
   - The date upon which an allegedly stolen credit card was issued is not necessary to describe the card, is not an essential element of the offense charged, and therefore is not a material fact which the State must allege and prove. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Abandonment.
   
   - Failure to specify a particular day in an indictment for abandonment is not fatal especially in view of an instruction that the jury should consider only such evidence as tends to show that the defendant violated the statute after a particular date. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 424</cite>, 160 S.E. 468 (1931).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Habitual Driving While Intoxicated.
   
   - Defendant's conviction of driving while intoxicated under G.S. 20-138.5 was affirmed; all of the requirements of the charge were met, as a disputed prior conviction occurred within the statutory seven year period, and the trial court properly allowed the State to amend the indictment to state the date of the conviction, as time was not of the essence pursuant to G.S. 15-155. State v. Winslow, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 137, 609 S.E.2d 463 (2005), review denied, in part, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 642</cite>, 617 S.E.2d 660 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In cases of sexual assaults on children, temporal specificity requisites diminish.
   
   Thus, where the child victim testified that defendant perpetrated rape and other sexual offenses against her on several occasions over a period of six years, and specifically recalled offenses occurring on September 27 and September 29, 1988, for both of which dates the defendant presented an alibi, and where the difference between the testimony of the victim as to which offense occurred on which date did not prevent the defendant from presenting his alibi, there was no error in letting the case go to the jury. State v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 406 S.E.2d 3, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 201</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 65 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Time of Birth in Bastardy Proceeding.
   
   - Indictment, in a bastardy proceeding, which states that the child was born on August 13, 1941, whereas the evidence was that the birth occurred on November 13, 1940, is not fatally defective. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 356</cite>, 23 S.E.2d 31 (1942).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reversal of Dates of Offenses.
   
   - Variance between indictments which charged the defendant with purchasing heroin on July 8 and marijuana on July 11 and evidence which showed that the dates of purchase were reversed was not such a fatal variance as to require a new trial. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 62, 175 S.E.2d 332 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The date given in a bill of indictment usually is not an essential element of the crime charged. The State may prove that the crime was in fact committed on some other date. This rule, however, may not be used to deprive a defendant of his defense. State v. Sills, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 370</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 379 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Include Year in Alleged Date of Offense.
   
   - Where the warrant upon which defendant was tried place the time of the offense as "on or about the 19 day of June, 19. . .," the failure to insert the year being defendant's only assignment of error, the warrant was not fatally defective. State v. Hawkins, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 674, 199 S.E.2d 746 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Change of Date on Indictment Permitted.
   
   - In prosecution for incest, where although the testimony of the young prosecuting witness as to the date of the offense differed from that of her mother, all of the State's evidence showed that the crime, if committed, took place on the Sunday of the weekend during which a certain individual visited the defendant's residence, the change on the indictment of the date of the offense, as permitted by the trial court, did not substantially alter the charge against the defendant, nor did it unfairly surprise him or prevent him from presenting a defense. State v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 349 S.E.2d 327 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was the fact that another felony was committed, not its specific date, which was the essential question in habitual felon indictment; therefore, because date alleged in indictment was neither an essential nor a substantial fact as to the charge of habitual felon, the trial court properly allowed the state to change the date in the habitual felon indictment. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 450 S.E.2d 516 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Fatal Variance Not Shown.
   
   - There was no fatal variance between the allegations contained in the indictment and the actual proof presented by the State with regard to the date of the offense, where although the warrant and bill of indictment showed the date of the offense as March 13, 1985, the defendant was put on notice as to the child victim's uncertainty as to the date during a probable cause hearing, and where, additionally, the defendant did not in fact rely on the date stated in the indictment. State v. Ramey, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 457</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 566 (1986).

       Upon receipt of such reports as are provided for in G.S. 15-155.1, the district attorney of superior court may make an investigation to determine whether the mother of an out-of-wedlock child or who is a recipient of Work First Family Assistance, has abandoned, is willfully neglecting or is refusing to support and maintain the child within the meaning of G.S. 14-326 or 49-2 or is diverting any part of the funds received as Work First Family Assistance to any purpose other than for the support and maintenance of a child in violation of G.S. 108-76.1. In making this investigation the district attorney is authorized to call upon:
       <ol>
        <li id="t15a15As15-155.2ol1a1">
         Any county board of social services or the Department of Health and Human Services for personal, clerical or investigative assistance and for access to any records kept by either such board and relating to the matter under investigation and such boards are hereby directed to assist in all investigations hereunder and to furnish all records relating thereto when so requested by the district attorney;
        </li>
        <li id="t15a15As15-155.2ol1a2">
         The board of county commissioners of any county within his district for legal or clerical assistance in making any investigation or investigations in such county and such boards are hereby authorized to furnish such assistance in their discretion; and
        </li>
        <li id="t15a15As15-155.2ol1a3">
         The district attorney of any inferior court in his district for personal assistance in making any investigation or investigations in the county in which the court is located and any district attorney so called upon is hereby authorized to furnish such assistance by and with the consent of the board of county commissioners of the county in which the court is located, which board shall provide and fix his compensation for assistance furnished.

      </li>
      <li id="t15a15As15-155.2ol1b">
       If following the investigation the district attorney has reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of G.S. 49-2, 14-326, 108-76.1 or any other criminal offense is being or has been committed, he shall send to the grand jury of the county in which he believes the offense is being or has been committed a bill of indictment charging the commission of the offense. Sole and exclusive jurisdiction of offenses discovered as a result of investigations under this section shall be vested in the superior court notwithstanding any other provisions of law, whether general, special or local. Provided nothing in this Article shall be construed to take from the inferior courts any authority or responsibility now vested in them by existing law or to compel the district attorney to again prosecute a crime that has been disposed of in the inferior courts.

       Exclusion of Bystanders Does Not Deny Right to Public Trial.
   
   - There was no merit in the contention of the defendants that the exclusion of bystanders during the testimony of the prosecutrix in a prosecution for rape denied them the right to a public trial. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for first-degree rape of a child, the constitutional right of defendant to a public trial was not violated by the court's order entered pursuant to this section that, during the testimony of the seven-year-old victim, the courtroom be cleared of all persons except defendant, defendant's family, defense counsel, defense witnesses, the prosecutor, the state's witnesses, officers of the court, members of the jury, and members of the victim's family. State v. Burney, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 529</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 693 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was not violated when the trial court closed the courtroom during the 13-year-old victim's necessary testimony, given the sexual nature of the charges of taking indecent liberties with a child, the quasi-familial relationship with the defendant, the type of other people present in the courtroom, the limited time and scope of the closure, and the lack of any reasonable alternatives to closing the courtroom. State v. Godley, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 562, 760 S.E.2d 285 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Factors Considered.
       </b>
       - In determining whether to close a courtroom, trial courts must consider the factors enunciated in Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 104 S. Ct. 2210, 81 L. Ed. 31 (1984) and may not rely solely on this section; however, a court need only articulate its fundamental reasons for closing a courtroom and is not required to exhaustively articulate every observation and inference underlying its decision. Bell v. Jarvis, 7 F. Supp. 2d 699 (E.D.N.C. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant's trial on charges of taking indecent liberties with a child, defendant's constitutional right to a public trial was not violated when the trial court closed the courtroom during the victim's testimony, G.S. 15-166, because the trial court made appropriate findings of fact utilizing the four-part test in Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39; defendant's wife, who was excluded, had engaged in behavior designed to intimidate the minor victim. State v. Comeaux, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 595, 741 S.E.2d 346 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's closure of the courtroom to all nonessential personnel during the minor victim's testimony did not violate defendant's right to a public trial, as the numerous adult bystanders contributed in part to the victim's emotional state, plus defendant was the victim's father and her non-hearsay testimony was necessary, and the closure was limited in time and scope. State v. Spence, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 367, 764 S.E.2d 670 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Consider Waller Test.
   
   - Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was violated when the trial court temporarily closed the courtroom during the victim's testimony, because the trial court did not utilize the four-part test set forth in Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 104 S. Ct. 2210, 81 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1984). State v. Rollins, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 572, 729 S.E.2d 73 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Object Waived Right to Challenge.
   
   - Defendant was not entitled to reversal due to the trial court's closure of the courtroom where defense counsel had an opportunity to object but did not. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 86, 636 S.E.2d 267 (2006).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Sufficiency of Findings.
       </b>
       - Trial court's finding that the minor victim's testimony was of a "delicate nature" was sufficient to justify a partial closure of the courtroom, even though that finding was contained in a memorandum the trial court prepared three years after the petitioner's conviction. Bell v. Jarvis, 7 F. Supp. 2d 699 (E.D.N.C. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Uncontested findings of fact, along with the contested findings found supported by the evidence, were sufficient to support the application of the test as required, in part as the findings noted that in closing the courtroom, the victim would be less inhibited in testifying completely about graphic sexual matters; although it was possible that other findings could have been made or other conclusions could have been drawn weighing the factors more in defendant's favor did not mean that the trial court erred. State v. Rollins, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 752 S.E.2d 230 (2013).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Voir Dire of Prosecuting Witness.
   
   - Voir dire of the prosecuting witness may, in a particular case, defeat the purpose of the statute, and this determination must be made on a case-by-case basis by the trial judge; in many cases, although not all, the evidence supporting the closure is likely to come from other witnesses who have knowledge of the victim's circumstances and condition and the crime. State v. Rollins, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 752 S.E.2d 230 (2013).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court erred in granting the State's motion to clear the courtroom during the victim's testimony because
   
   it did not determine if the party seeking closure had advanced an overriding interest that was likely to be prejudiced, ordered closure no broader than necessary to protect that interest, considered reasonable alternatives to closing the procedure, and made findings adequate to support the closure. State v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 445 S.E.2d 622, stay granted pending appeal, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 784</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 435, cert. denied, temporary stay dissolved, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 804</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 752 (1994).

   - Although the court would agree that the burden is upon the State to present sufficient evidence, either in its case in chief or by voir dire, to permit the trial court to satisfy the test regarding courtroom closures, the court specifically does not adopt any particular requirements as to how this presentation of evidence must be made; defendant's argument that the findings had to be based solely on evidence presented prior to the State's motion for closure was without merit, where there was sufficient evidence to support many of the findings presented prior to the motion. State v. Rollins, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 752 S.E.2d 230 (2013).

       § 15-167. Extension of session of court by trial judge.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever a trial for a felony is in progress on the last Friday of any session of court and it appears to the trial judge that it is unlikely that such trial can be completed before 5:00 P.M. on such Friday, the trial judge may extend the session as long as in his opinion it shall be necessary for the purposes of the case, but he may recess court on Friday or Saturday of such week to such time on the succeeding Sunday or Monday as, in his discretion, he deems wise. The trial judge, in his discretion, may exercise the same power in the trial of any other cause under the same circumstances, except civil actions begun after Thursday of the last week. The length of time such court shall remain in session each day shall be in the discretion of the trial judge. Whenever a trial judge continues a session pursuant to this section, he shall cause an order to such effect to be entered in the minutes, which order may be entered at such time as the judge directs, either before or after he has extended the session.

       Section Constitutional.
   
   - This section is constitutional. State v. Adair, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 298</cite> (1872); State v. Jefferson, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 309</cite> (1872); State v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Expiration of Session No Ground for Discharging Jury.
   
   - The expiration of a term (now session) of court is no ground for discharging a jury before verdict, for the term (now session) may be continued for the purposes of the trial. State v. McGimsey, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 377</cite> (1879).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Special Term Extended.
   
   - Where a trial began on Wednesday of the last week of a special term and the jury had not agreed upon a verdict on Saturday night, it was not improper for the trial judge to open and conduct the regular term on Monday following to continue the special term into that week for the purpose of receiving the verdict of the jury, since the rights of the parties were not prejudiced thereby. National Bank v. Gilmer, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 684</cite>, 22 S.E. 2, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 416</cite>, 23 S.E. 333 (1895).

       Entry in Minutes Held in Compliance with Section.
   
   - Daily entries on the journal during the trial of a felony, stating the name of the case and that the court takes a recess "until 9:30 A.M. tomorrow," and the entry next day "court convened at 9:30 A.M. pursuant to recess," etc., in regular form, constitute a sufficient compliance with this section.

       Open Court Announcements Sufficient.
   
   - Trial court, in making repeated announcements in open court concerning continuing the trial without objection from defendant, satisfied G. S. 15-167. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 621 S.E.2d 254 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a conviction of first-degree felony murder based on discharging a firearm into an occupied vehicle, although there was no formal order memorializing a trial court's extension of a session of court, the extension complied with G.S. 15-167 because the trial court repeatedly announced that it was recessing court, and defendant did not object. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 680 S.E.2d 720 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 747</cite>, 689 S.E.2d 141 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court sufficiently complied with G.S. 15-167 and properly extended the court session because defendant did not object to the trial judge's announcement prior to the trial that he would be recessing trial on Monday due to a prior obligation; he did not object to the trial judge's announcement prior to dismissing the jurors after the Friday afternoon session, in the presence of defendant and defense counsel, that court would be in recess until Tuesday, due to his Monday obligation; and he did not object when the trial court reconvened on Tuesday.

   - This section is not applicable where all the evidence for the State, uncontradicted by any evidence for the defendant, if believed by the jury, shows that the crime charged in the indictment was committed as alleged therein, and there is no evidence tending to support a contention that the defendants, if not guilty of the crime charged in the indictment, were guilty of a crime of less degree.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Indictment Includes.
   
   - An indictment for any offense against the criminal law includes all lesser degrees of the same crime known to the law; and conviction may be had of the lesser offense when the charge is inclusive of both. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 685</cite>, 116 S.E. 736 (1923).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Indictment Includes - Murder.
   
   - Under an indictment for murder, the defendant may be convicted either of murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, or manslaughter, and even of assault with a deadly weapon, or simple assault, if the evidence shall warrant such finding when he is not acquitted entirely. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 685</cite>, 116 S.E. 736 (1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, when it is sought to fall back on the lesser offense of assault and battery or assault with a deadly weapon in case the greater offense of murder or manslaughter is not made out, the indictment for murder should be drawn as necessarily to include an assault and battery or assault with a deadly weapon, or it should contain a separate count to that effect. State v. Rorie, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 579</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 233 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       A bill of indictment charging that defendant "unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously and of malice aforethought did kill and murder the victim" is insufficient to support a verdict of guilty of assault, assault inflicting serious injury or assault with intent to kill. State v. Whiteside, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 389</cite>, 383 S.E.2d 911 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Indictment Includes - Robbery.
   
   - The crime of robbery ex vi termini includes an assault on the person, and in a prosecution for robbery, the court must submit the question of defendant's guilt of assault in those instances where the evidence warrants such finding, even in the absence of a request, and even though the State contends solely for conviction of robbery and the defendant contends solely for complete acquittal. State v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 156</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 545 (1954).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Indictment Includes - Rape.
   
   - An indictment for rape, as this section declares, includes an assault against the person; and where there is evidence sufficient to warrant such finding, the jury may acquit of the felony of rape and return a verdict of guilty of a lesser criminal assault. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 134</cite>, 105 S.E.2d 513 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       An assault with intent to commit rape under former G.S. 14-22 is a lesser degree of the crime of rape. Therefore, a conviction or acquittal of the former bars a subsequent prosecution of the latter based on the same act or transaction. State v. Birckhead, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 494</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 838 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Indictment Includes - Attempted First-Degree Rape.
   
   - In deciding whether trial court erred in submitting assault on a female as a lesser included offense of charge of attempted first-degree rape, the appellate court must consider (1) whether the charge of attempted first-degree rape includes all the essential elements of assault on a female and (2) whether there was some evidence to support a finding of assault on a female. State v. Rick, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 282 S.E.2d 497 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Indictment Includes - Assault with Intent to Rape.
   
   - Under a bill of indictment charging an assault with an intent to commit rape, under former G.S. 14-22 the lesser offense of assault and battery may be found to have been committed, and in such instance a special issue may be submitted to the jury, if necessary, so that, in accordance with the jury's finding, the court may determine the grade of the punishment. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 578</cite>, 72 S.E. 853 (1911).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Assault is not a less degree of the crime of larceny from the person,
   
   and therefore, in a prosecution for larceny, the court is not required to submit the question of defendant's guilt of assault, even though there be evidence thereof. State v. Acrey, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 90</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 201 (1964).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty to Instruct as to Assault.
   
   - Where the indictment is sufficient and the evidence is conflicting as to whether the defendant committed highway robbery or an assault with a deadly weapon, the jury may find for the lesser offense, and it is the duty of the trial judge to so instruct the jury, though a special request therefor has not been aptly tendered in writing. State v. Holt, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 490</cite>, 135 S.E. 324 (1926); State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 476</cite>, 87 S.E.2d 906 (1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the State's evidence in a prosecution under an indictment for rape, if believed to its fullest extent, established the crime of rape but the defendant testified the intercourse was with the girl's consent and the evidence was conflicting in other respects, it would have been error for the court not to have charged the jury on the lesser offenses. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 717</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 52 (1957).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Duty Arises.
   
   - The necessity for instructing the jury as to an included crime of lesser degree than that charged arises when and only when there is evidence from which the jury could find that such included crime of lesser degree was committed. The presence of such evidence is the determinative factor. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 77</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 481 (1969); State v. Murry, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 197</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 738 (1970); State v. Carnes, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 549</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 235 (1971); State v.

       The necessity for instructing the jury as to an included crime of lesser degree than that charged arises when and only when there is evidence from which the jury could find that such included crime of lesser degree was committed. The presence of such evidence is the determinative factor. Hence, there is no such necessity if the State's evidence tends to show a completed robbery and there is no conflicting evidence relating to elements of the crime charged. Mere contention that the jury might accept the State's evidence in part and might reject it in part will not suffice. State v. LeGrande, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 159 S.E.2d 265 (1968); State v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 188 S.E.2d 667 (1972).

      <p>
       No Duty to Instruct Where Evidence Supports Greater Offense.
   
   - The trial court is not required to charge the jury upon the question of the defendant's guilt of lesser degrees of the crime charged in the indictment when there is no evidence to sustain a verdict of defendant's guilt of such lesser degrees. State v. Lampkins, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 497</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 106 (1975), cert. denied, 428 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 3220, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1216 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court is not required to submit to the jury a lesser included offense when there is no evidence of such lesser included offense. State v. LeGrande, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 159 S.E.2d 265 (1968); State v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 185 S.E.2d 302 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the State's evidence tends to show a completed robbery and there is no conflicting evidence relating to the elements of this offense, the court is not required to submit the question of defendant's guilt of assault, notwithstanding the jury's right to accept the State's evidence in part and reject it in part. State v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 156</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 545 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court in a prosecution for common-law robbery did not err in refusing to instruct on the lesser included offense of misdemeanor assault where the State's evidence tended to show that defendant took the victim's money by violent means, and defendant admitted taking the victim's money but denied assaulting him. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 690, 272 S.E.2d 160 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for armed robbery, where the evidence tends to show that the defendant had committed the armed robbery as alleged in the indictment or that the defendant was innocent, the trial court is not required to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of assault with a deadly weapon and simple assault. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 616, 170 S.E.2d 539 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a rape case, the trial court did not err in failing to submit the lesser included offenses of assault with intent to commit rape under former G.S. 14-22 and assault on a female where all the State's evidence tended to show commission of rape and the defendant's evidence was that he had never had intercourse with the prosecutrix nor did he touch her in a manner constituting an assault. State v. Lampkins, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 497</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 106 (1975), cert. denied, 428 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 3220, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1216 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court in a rape prosecution did not err in failing to submit to the jury the lesser included offenses of assault with intent to commit rape under former G.S. 14-22 and of assault on a female, where the State's evidence was positive as to each and every element of the crime of rape and there was no conflict in the evidence relating to any element thereof. State v. Flippin, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 682</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 917 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Verdict Does Not Cure Failure to Charge upon Lesser Degree.
   
   - The error of the judge in failing to charge on the supporting evidence, upon the lesser degree of the crime of rape, under a charge thereof in the indictment, is not cured by the verdict finding that the defendant was guilty of the greater degree of the crime charged in the indictment. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 685</cite>, 116 S.E. 736 (1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a well recognized principle that where one is indicted for a crime, and under the same bill he may be convicted of a lesser degree of the same crime, and there is evidence tending to support the milder verdict, the prisoner is entitled to have this view presented to the jury under a correct charge, and an error in this respect is not cured by a verdict convicting the prisoner of a higher offense, for in such case it cannot be determined that the jury would not have convicted of the lesser crime if the view had been correctly presented by the judge, upon evidence. State v. Bass, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 209</cite>, 105 S.E.2d 645 (1958).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conviction of Lesser Offense Where Evidence Supports Greater Offense.
   
   - Where all the evidence points to a graver crime and the jury's verdict is for an offense of a lesser degree, although illogical and incongruous, it will not be disturbed, since it is favorable to accused. State v. Bentley, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 563</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 738 (1943); State v. Roy, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 558</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 840 (1951); State v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 271 S.E.2d 77 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Simple Verdict of Guilty.
   
   - While this section permits a verdict for an assault when it is embraced in the charge of a greater offense, as rape or other felony, a verdict simply of "guilty," and not specifying a lower offense, is a verdict of guilty of the offense charged in the indictment. State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 1031</cite>, 29 S.E. 381 (1898); State v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 225</cite>, 134 S.E. 458 (1926).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Nonsuit or Dismissal as to Greater Offense.
   
   - Upon an indictment charging an assault with intent to commit rape, defendant may be convicted of an assault upon a female as though separately charged, and motion to dismiss under G.S. 15-173 was properly refused where there was sufficient evidence to convict of an assault. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 37</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 812 (1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon an indictment for an assault with intent to commit rape, even though the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict, motion for judgment of dismissal or nonsuit cannot be granted, as defendant may be convicted of an assault. State v. Gay, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 141</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 458 (1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where in a prosecution under a bill of indictment charging assault with intent to commit rape the evidence discloses an assault but is insufficient to prove the intent necessary for a conviction of this offense, defendant is entitled to nonsuit on the offense charged, but is not entitled to his discharge, since he may be convicted under the bill of indictment for assault upon a female as though this offense had been separately charged in the bill. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 326</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 84 (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution of a defendant for assault with intent to commit rape, under former G.S. 14-22 nonsuit of the felony does not entitle the defendant to his discharge, but the State may put defendant on trial under the same indictment for assault on a female, defendant being a male over the age of 18. State v. Gammons, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 753</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 649 (1963).

        When a defendant is indicted for a criminal offense he may be convicted of the charged offense or of a lesser included offense when the greater offense charged in the bill contains all the essential elements of the lesser offense, all of which could be proved by proof of the allegations of fact contained in the indictment. State v. Riera, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 361</cite>, 172 S.E.2d 535 (1970); State v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 751</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 646 (1974); State v.

        G.S. 15-169 and this section are applicable only when there is evidence tending to show the defendant may be guilty of an included crime of lesser degree. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 202</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 666 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment or information is insufficient to charge the accused with the commission of a minor offense, or one of less degree, unless, in charging the major offense, it necessarily includes within itself all of the essential elements of the minor offense. State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 430, 176 S.E.2d 388 (1970); State v. Rick, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 282 S.E.2d 497 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment or information is insufficient to charge the accused with the commission of a minor offense or one of less degree unless, in charging the major offense, it necessarily includes within itself all of the essential elements of the minor offense, or sufficiently sets them forth by separate allegations in an added count; but when the indictment or information contains all the essential constituents of the minor offense, it sufficiently alleges that offense. State v. Rorie, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 579</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 233 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction With Other Statutes
   
   - G.S. 15-144, when construed alongside G.S. 15-170, implicitly authorizes the State to utilize a short-form indictment to charge attempted first-degree murder; when drafting such a indictment, it is sufficient for statutory purposes for the State to allege that the accused person feloniously, willfully, and of his malice aforethought, did (attempt to) kill and murder the named victim. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 832</cite>, 616 S.E.2d 496 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Short-form Attempted Murder Indictment.
   
   - Defendant's attempt to have conviction for attempted first-degree murder vacated based on his claim that the use of a short-form indictment for the crime of attempted murder was not authorized in North Carolina was without merit; the indictment sufficiently alleged the offense of attempted first-degree murder using the language from G.S. 15-144 and G.S. 15-170 providing that defendant could be convicted of the crime charged therein, or of an attempt to commit the crime so charged, or of a less degree of the same crime. State v. McVay, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 335, 620 S.E.2d 883 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Lesser included offense
   
   is one in which the greater offense contains all of the essential elements of the lesser offense. State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 629</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 375 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Greater crime includes the lesser,
   
   so that where an offense is alleged in an indictment, and the jury acquits as to that one, it may convict of the lesser offense when the charge is inclusive of both offenses. State v. Craig, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 241 S.E.2d 704 (1978); State v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 276 S.E.2d 738 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction for attempted sexual statutory offense was upheld in action charging the completed crime since the evidence showed that defendant demanded that victim perform fellatio, but the victim refused; thus, evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for the attempted, but not the completed, crime. State v. Sines, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 579 S.E.2d 895 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 468</cite>, 587 S.E.2d 69 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction on lesser offense renders any error in submission of greater offense harmless.
   
   State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 397 S.E.2d 364 (1990), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 576</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 520 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Offense Not Included If It Contains Element Not in Other Crime.
   
   - A crime is not a lesser included offense of another crime if the former contains any element that the latter does not. State v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 308 S.E.2d 500 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Crime of "less degree" is not exclusively one which carries a less severe sanction
   
   than the crime formally charged in the indictment. State v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 391</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 374 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Facts of particular case should not determine whether one crime is a lesser included offense of another.
   
   Rather, the definitions accorded the crimes determine whether one offense is a lesser included offense of another crime. In other words, all of the essential elements are included in the greater crime. If the lesser crime has an essential element which is not completely covered by the greater crime, it is not a lesser included offense. The determination is made on a definitional, not a factual basis. State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 629</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 375 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination of whether one crime is a lesser included offense of another is made on a definitional, not a factual, basis. All essential elements of the lesser offense must be completely covered by the essential elements of the greater offense. State v. Wortham, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 54, 341 S.E.2d 76 (1986), modified, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 669</cite>, 351 S.E.2d 294 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant may plead guilty to less degrees of the same crimes
   
   charged in the indictments against him, and the State may accept such pleas. State v. Woody, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 544</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 108 (1967).

   - It is not within the trial judge's province to negotiate a plea or enter judgment on a plea to a charge which is not a lesser included offense of the charge at issue. In re Fuller, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 157</cite>, 478 S.E.2d 641 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence Required to Support Conviction of Lesser Degree.
   
   - When the solicitor (now district attorney) announces that he will not seek a conviction upon the maximum degree of the crime charged in the bill of indictment, and the defendant interposes no objection to being tried upon the lesser degree of the offense, the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction of the lesser degree must be measured by the same standards which would be applied had the bill of indictment charged only the lesser degree of the offense. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 115</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 453 (1971), overruled on other grounds, State v. Hickey, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 457</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 646 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Not to Arbitrarily Convict of Lesser Degree.
   
   - This section and G.S. 15-169 were not intended to give to the jury the arbitrary right or discretion to convict a defendant of a lesser degree of the crime charged or of a less serious offense than that charged, if the uncontradicted evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the more serious offense charged in the bill of indictment. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 383</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 402 (1947).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Silence of Verdict as to All But One Count Distinguished.
   
   - Where there are several counts in a bill, if the jury find the defendant guilty on one count and say nothing in their verdict concerning the other counts, it will be equivalent to a verdict of not guilty as to them. This principle should not be confused with the practice, authorized by this section, which permits the conviction of a less degree of the same crime, when included in a single count. State v. Hampton, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 283</cite>, 186 S.E. 251 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Joinder Mere Surplusage.
   
   - Since this section was adopted, the joinder in an indictment of a count for a lesser offense, or for an attempt to commit the same, is mere surplusage. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 645</cite>, 18 S.E. 51 (1893).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Election by District Attorney to Try Lesser Degrees and Included Offenses.
   
   - Upon the return of an indictment sufficient in form to support a conviction of the defendant of either the maximum degree of the offense charged, a lesser degree thereof or a lesser offense, all of the elements of which are included in the crime charged, the solicitor (now district attorney) has the authority to elect not to try the defendant on the maximum degree of the offense charged but to put him on trial for the lesser degree thereof and lesser offenses included therein. The effect of such election by the solicitor (now district attorney), announced in open court, is that of a verdict of not guilty upon the maximum degree of the offense charged, leaving for trial the lesser degree and the lesser included offenses. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 115</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 453 (1971), overruled on other grounds, State v. Hickey, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 457</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 646 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        When, upon arraignment, or thereafter in open court, and in the presence of the defendant, the solicitor (now district attorney) announces the State will not ask for a verdict of guilty of the maximum crime charged but will ask for a verdict of guilty on a designated and included lesser offense embraced in the bill, and the announcement is entered in the minutes of the court, the announcements is the equivalent of a verdict of not guilty on the charge or charges the solicitor (now district attorney) has elected to abandon. State v. Gaston, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 575, 167 S.E.2d 510 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant was charged with burglary in the first degree in the bill of indictment. And when the solicitor (now district attorney) stated that he would not ask for a verdict of first degree burglary, but would only ask for a verdict of second degree burglary on the indictment, it was tantamount to taking a nolle prosequi with leave on the capital charge. State v. Gaston, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 575, 167 S.E.2d 510 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Uncontradicted Evidence of Greater Offense May Support Lesser Verdict.
   
   - When the State, either through a bill of indictment as returned by the grand jury or through the election of its solicitor (now district attorney) to seek a lesser verdict, brings the defendant to trial on a lesser degree of the offense charged, the case can be submitted to the jury if the uncontradicted evidence, as thereafter developed, shows the defendant is guilty of the more serious degree of the crime. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 115</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 453 (1971), overruled on other grounds, State v. Hickey, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 457</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 646 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction of Greater Offense Than Charged.
   
   - It would be without precedent to try defendant for one offense and to convict him of another and greater offense, even though the conviction be of a higher degree of the same offense for which he is being tried. State v. Jordan, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 155</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 111 (1946).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Elements of Attempt.
   
   - The two elements of an attempt to commit a crime are: (1) An intent to commit it, and (2) an overt act done for that purpose, going beyond mere preparation, but falling short of the completed offense. State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 293 S.E.2d 274, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 746</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 482 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        An attempt is an act done with intent to commit that crime, carried beyond mere preparation to commit it, but falling short of its actual commission. State v. McAlister, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 295 S.E.2d 501 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 471</cite>, 299 S.E.2d 226 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Intent Alone Not Sufficient for Attempt Conviction.
   
   - The intent, though connected with preparations to commit a criminal offense, is not alone sufficient for a conviction of the attempt, unless it is connected with some overt act or acts toward the end in view that will, in the judgment of the one charged, and as matters appeared to him, result in the consummation of the contemplated purpose. State v. Addor, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 687</cite>, 110 S.E. 650 (1922).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Motion for Nonsuit Denied.
   
   - A motion for judgment as of nonsuit addressed to the entire bill is properly overruled if there is evidence sufficient to support a conviction of the crime charged or of an included crime. State v. Virgil, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 73</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 777 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        New Trial Must Be on Full Charge.
   
   - Upon an appeal from a conviction for a lesser offense than that charged in the indictment, a new trial, if granted, must be upon the full charge in the bill. State v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 621</cite>, 55 S.E. 342 (1906).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of State's Election of Felony Murder Theory.
   
   - The State's election to try a homicide case, and the trial judge's submission of it to the jury, only on a felony murder theory did not in effect acquit defendant of murder on a theory of premeditation and deliberation and all of its lesser included homicide offenses. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 583</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 555 (1989), holding that the jury should have been instructed on involuntary murder under the circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant may always show by the evidence not only his innocence under the theory of prosecution chosen by the State, but also his possible guilt of some lesser offense. If this lesser offense is included in the crime charged in the indictment and if there is evidence to support it, defendant is entitled to have it submitted to the jury. These different theories of defense cannot be abrogated by the State's decision to prosecute, nor the trial court's decision to submit the case on only one prosecutorial theory, when under the indictment and the evidence adduced another is more favorable to defendant. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 583</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 555 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in allowing the State to amend the indictment
   
   because the allegations in the original felonious breaking and entering indictment did not encompass the elements of assault with a deadly weapon with the intent to kill or assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. State v. Silas, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 609 S.E.2d 400 (2005), aff'd in part, modified in part, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 377</cite>, 627 S.E.2d 604 (2006).

       <p>
        Defendant Entitled to Complete Charge.
   
   - Under the provisions of this section when the bill of indictment is sufficient with the supporting evidence upon the trial, the defendant may be convicted of the criminal offense charged or of a lesser degree thereof, and he is entitled to a charge from the court on all degrees of the crime thus encompassed by the indictment. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 784</cite>, 125 S.E. 617 (1924). See also State v. Keaton, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 682</cite>, 175 S.E. 296 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        When there is evidence tending to support a milder verdict than the one charged in the bill of indictment the defendant is entitled to have the different views presented to the jury under a proper charge. State v. Burnette, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 153</cite>, 195 S.E. 356 (1938); State v. DeGraffenreid, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 461</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 130 (1943). See also State v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 442</cite>, 11 S.E.2d 280 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is evidence of defendant's guilt of a lesser degree of the crime charged in the indictment, the court must submit defendant's guilt of the lesser included offense to the jury. State v. Putnam, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 211 S.E.2d 493 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule of practice is, that when it is permissible under the indictment to convict the defendant of "a less degree of the same crime," and there is evidence to support the milder verdict, the defendant is entitled to have the different views arising on the evidence presented to the jury under proper instructions. State v. Childress, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 208</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 42 (1947); State v. Haith, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 269 S.E.2d 205, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 403</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 449 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Conviction of Offense Charged Does Not Cure Error.
   
   - A verdict of guilty of the offense charged in the indictment does not cure error of the court in failing to submit to the jury the question of defendant's guilt of less degrees of the crime. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 377</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 733 (1948); State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 476</cite>, 87 S.E.2d 906 (1955); State v. Lang, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 117, 293 S.E.2d 255, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 747</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 761 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        An error in failing to submit lesser offenses is not cured by a verdict convicting him of the crime as charged in the bill of indictment, for in such case it cannot be known whether the jury would have convicted of a less degree if the different views, arising on the evidence, had been correctly presented by the trial court. State v. Burnette, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 153</cite>, 195 S.E. 356 (1938); State v. DeGraffenreid, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 461</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 130 (1943). See also State v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 442</cite>, 11 S.E.2d 280 (1940); State v. Childress, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 208</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 42 (1947); State v. Riera, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 361</cite>, 172 S.E.2d 535 (1970); State v. Haith, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Error in failing to submit defendant's guilt of the lesser included offense to the jury is not cured by a verdict convicting defendant of the offense charged. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 712, 171 S.E.2d 17 (1969); State v. Holloway, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 147, 171 S.E.2d 475 (1970); State v. Putnam, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 211 S.E.2d 493 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        An error in failing to charge upon the lesser degrees of the crime is not cured by a verdict of conviction upon one of a greater degree. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 784</cite>, 125 S.E. 617 (1924). See also State v. Keaton, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 682</cite>, 175 S.E. 296 (1934).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Evidence Must Support Conviction of Lesser Offense.
   
   - This section does not make mandatory the submission to the jury of a lesser included offense where the indictment does not charge such offense and where there is no evidence of such offense. State v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 163 S.E.2d 125 (1968); State v. Stevenson, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 164 S.E.2d 24 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        A court is not required to submit a lesser included offense to the jury when there is no evidence to support such a charge. State v. Carriker, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 91, 210 S.E.2d 98 (1974), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 530</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 134 (1975); State v. Tidwell, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 668</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 577 (1989).

        In order to justify submission of a lesser included offense there must be some evidence to support submission of the lesser offenses to the jury. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 526</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 314 (1982).

        Necessity for instructing jury as to included crime of lesser degree
   
   than that charged arises when and only when there is evidence from which the jury could find that such included crime of lesser degree was committed. The presence of such evidence is the determinative factor. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 134</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 27 (1965); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where all the evidence at the trial of a criminal action, if believed by the jury, tends to show that the crime charged in the indictment was committed as alleged therein, and there is no evidence tending to show the commission of a crime of less degree, it is not error for the court to fail to instruct the jury that they may acquit the defendant of the crime charged in the indictment and convict him of a crime of less degree. State v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 357</cite>, 160 S.E. 358 (1931); State v. Manning, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 70</cite>, 18 S.E.2d 821 (1942); State v. Sawyer, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 61</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 34 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of this section in regard to conviction of a less degree of the crime charged in a bill of indictment applies only where there is some evidence that a less degree of the crime had been committed, and where the State's uncontradicted evidence is to the effect that the crime of rape had been committed and the defendant relies solely upon an alibi, the refusal of the court to charge upon the lesser degrees of the crime or of an attempt is not error. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 494</cite>, 160 S.E. 577 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one is indicted for a crime and under the same bill it is permissible to convict the defendant of a less degree of the same crime and there is evidence tending to support a milder verdict the prisoner is entitled to have the different views presented to the jury under a proper charge, but where there is no evidence to support such milder verdict the court is not required to submit the question of such verdict to the jury. State v. Thacker, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 185 S.E.2d 455 (1971), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 447</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 145 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The necessity for instructing the jury as to an included crime of lesser degree than that charged arises when and only when there is evidence from which the jury could find that such included crime of lesser degree was committed. The presence of such evidence is the determinative factor. Hence, there is no such necessity if the State's evidence tends to show completion of the offense as charged and there is no conflicting evidence relating to elements of the crime charged. Mere contention that the jury might accept the State's evidence in part and might reject it in part will not suffice. State v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 163 S.E.2d 125 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant may be convicted of a less degree of the crime charged, or for which he is being tried, when there is evidence to support the milder verdict. State v. Jordan, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 155</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 111 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proper case where it is permissible under the indictment to convict defendant of a lesser included offense, the court must still determine that there is evidence tending to support the lesser offense in order to submit it for the jury's consideration. Upon a favorable determination of both issues, that is, that the crime is a lesser included offense and that there is evidence to support it, defendant is entitled to have the instruction on the lesser offense submitted to the jury. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 550</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 569 (1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 951, 110 S. Ct. 2215, 109 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Instruction on Lesser Included Homicides Required.
   
   - In a felony murder prosecution under an indictment in the form prescribed by G.S. 15-144, evidence that defendant did not commit the underlying felony requires an instruction upon whatever lesser included homicides the indictment and the evidence support. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 583</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 555 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Instructions Not Required Where State's Evidence Is Positive as to Each Element.
   
   - Where the State's evidence is positive as to each and every element of the crime charged and there is no conflicting evidence relating to any element of the charged crime, the court is not required to submit an issue as to defendant's guilt or innocence of a lesser included offense. State v. Owen, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 598, 211 S.E.2d 830, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 263</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 435 (1975); State v. McKinnon, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 288</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 118 (1982); State v. Musselwhite, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 297 S.E.2d 181 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court in a rape prosecution did not err in failing to submit to the jury the lesser included offenses of assault with intent to commit rape under former G.S. 14-22 and of assault on a female, where the State's evidence was positive as to each and every element of the crime of rape and there was no conflict in the evidence relating to any element thereof. State v. Flippin, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 682</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 917 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Uncontradicted.
   
   - It is not necessary to submit the lesser included offense if the evidence discloses no conflicting evidence relating to the essential elements of the greater crime. State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 293 S.E.2d 274, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 746</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 482 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the uncontradicted evidence is that the deceased was murdered by poison, there is no basis for a verdict of second-degree murder or manslaughter. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 115</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 453 (1971), overruled on other grounds, State v. Hickey, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 457</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 646 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where upon the trial for murder all the evidence tends to show that if the defendant is guilty, he is guilty of the crime of murder in the first degree, the failure of the trial court to charge upon the law of murder in the second degree or manslaughter is not error under this section. State v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 640</cite>, 172 S.E. 186 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where all the evidence tends to show that defendants feloniously took money from the person of prosecuting witness by violence and against his will through the use or threatened use of firearms, the court properly limits the jury to a verdict of guilty of robbery with firearms or a verdict of not guilty, there being no evidence warranting court in submitting the question of defendant's guilt of less degrees of the crime. State v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 659</cite>, 46 S.E.2d 834 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a rape case, the trial court did not err in failing to submit the lesser included offenses of assault with intent to commit rape under former G.S. 14-22 and assault on a female where all the State's evidence tended to show commission of rape and the defendant's evidence was that he had never had intercourse with the prosecutrix nor did he touch her in a manner constituting an assault. State v. Lampkins, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 497</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 106 (1975), cert. denied, 428 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 3220, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1216 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Absence of Specific Request for Instruction.
   
   - When there is evidence of guilt of a lesser offense, a defendant is entitled to have the trial court instruct the jury with respect to that lesser included offense even though the defendant makes no request for such an instruction. State v. Lang, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 117, 293 S.E.2d 255, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 747</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 761 (1982); State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 293 S.E.2d 274, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 746</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 482 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the defendant is entitled to an instruction on the lesser offense, based on the presence of such evidence, it is of no legal significance that defendant's counsel did not make a specific request for the instruction nor that the defendant was subsequently convicted of the greater offense. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 276 S.E.2d 715, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 319</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 658 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a defendant's sole defense is one of alibi,
   
   he is not entitled to have the jury consider a lesser offense on the theory that jurors may take bits and pieces of the State's evidence and bits and pieces of defendant's evidence and thus find him guilty of a lesser offense not positively supported by the evidence. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 550</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 569 (1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 951, 110 S. Ct. 2215, 109 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant Not Entitled to Instruction.
   
   - Defendant's testimony was that he knew nothing of any of the controlled substances found in the house, there was no basis on which a jury could find that a lesser offense was committed, and at trial the defendant denied knowledge of all of the controlled substances, not just those not in "plain view;" therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense of felonious possession of heroin. State v. Agubata, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 375 S.E.2d 702 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a trafficking by possession case, the trial judge properly refused to instruct on attempt where the State's uncontroverted evidence showed that defendant gave officer a tube sock full of cash and discussed the exchange before the officer placed cocaine in the back seat of his vehicle and left the car. State v. Broome, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 523 S.E.2d 448 (1999), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 362</cite>, 543 S.E.2d 136 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Error to Charge on Unsupported Lesser Degree.
   
   - Where all the evidence tends to show that the crime charged in the indictment was committed, and there is no evidence tending to show the commission of a crime of lesser degree, the principle of lesser included offenses does not apply and it would be erroneous for the court to charge on the unsupported lesser degree. State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 293 S.E.2d 274, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 746</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 482 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Such Error Not Prejudicial.
   
   - Error committed by the court in submitting the question of defendant's guilt of a lesser degree of the offense charged cannot be prejudicial to defendant. State v. Chase, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 589</cite>, 58 S.E.2d 364 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for armed robbery, defendant was not prejudiced by error, if any, in the trial court's submission to the jury of the lesser included offense of common-law robbery. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 680, 270 S.E.2d 117 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction as to Lesser Offense Absent Evidence.
   
   - If there is evidence of self-defense and no evidence of involuntary manslaughter, it is prejudicial error to submit a charge of involuntary manslaughter in a trial for second-degree murder. State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 833, 266 S.E.2d 3 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Instructions as to Lesser Degree May Invite Compromise Verdict.
   
   - Upon a trial under an indictment for first-degree burglary, there being no announcement by the solicitor (now district attorney) of his intent to seek a milder verdict, the prosecuting witness testified that the defendant broke and entered her dwelling house in the nighttime and assaulted and raped her therein and the defense is alibi, to instruct the jury that it might return a verdict of second-degree burglary is simply to invite a compromise verdict. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 115</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 453 (1971), overruled on other grounds, State v. Hickey, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 457</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 646 (1986).

        Crime of accessory after the fact is not included in the charge of the principal crime.
   
   State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 450</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 213 (1961), commented on in 41 N.C.L. Rev. 118 (1962).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment charging a completed offense is sufficient to support a conviction for attempt
   
   to commit the crime charged. This statute applies even though the completed crime and the attempt are not in the same statute. State v. Slade, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 303, 343 S.E.2d 571, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 419</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 604 (1986); State v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 187, 510 S.E.2d 698 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment charging defendant with the completed offense of giving a controlled substance to an inmate was sufficient to enable him to adequately prepare for trial and to protect him from being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense, so as to support his conviction of attempt to give a controlled substance to an inmate. State v. Slade, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 303, 343 S.E.2d 571, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 419</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 604 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment for statutory sexual offense was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for attempted statutory sexual offense. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 86, 636 S.E.2d 267 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an appellate court held insufficient evidence supported defendant's second-degree kidnapping conviction, it was error not to consider if defendant committed attempted second-degree kidnapping because (1) that was the North Carolina Supreme Court's practice, and (2) sufficient evidence showed defendant committed that crime. State v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 474</cite>, 756 S.E.2d 32 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficiency of Indictment.
   
   - As a result of the fact that an indictment would support a conviction of the crime charged therein or of a less degree of the same crime, or of an attempt to commit the crime so charged, or of an attempt to commit a less degree of the same crime, defendant's conviction for the attempted manufacture of marijuana rested upon the indictment returned against defendant for the purpose of charging defendant with manufacturing marijuana. State v. Lofton, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 216</cite>, 827 S.E.2d 88 (2019).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Murder.
   
   - In a prosecution for murder, where the evidence raises a question as to whether or not the killing was intentional, this section requires that the question of the defendant's guilt of manslaughter be submitted to the jury with proper instructions. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 377</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 733 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is evidence to support a charge of murder and evidence to support the defendant's plea of homicide by misadventure, and also evidence of manslaughter, this section requires that the less degree of the same crime be submitted to the jury with proper instructions. State v. Childress, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 208</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 42 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence in a first-degree murder prosecution is susceptible to the interpretation that defendant killed in self-defense, the court must submit the question of defendant's guilt of manslaughter. State v. Holloway, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 147, 171 S.E.2d 475 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the original indictment charging defendant with attempted first-degree murder was constitutionally and statutorily sufficient to provide jurisdiction, allege attempted voluntary manslaughter, and was not fatally defective, no manifest necessity existed to declare a mistrial over defendant's objections, the State was barred from re-indicting defendant on attempted murder or manslaughter and the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the subsequent indictment. Therefore, defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated by his subsequent indictment, prosecution, trial, and conviction of attempted first-degree murder. State v. Schalow, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 795 S.E.2d 567 (2016).

        Rape.
   
   - An indictment for rape includes an assault with intent to commit rape under former G.S. 14-22. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 717</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 52 (1957); State v. Birckhead, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 494</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 838 (1962).

        Rape of Child Under Age 12.
   
   - The offense of assault on a female by a male over the age of 18, G.S. 14-33(b)(2), is not, as a matter of law, a lesser included offense of first-degree rape of a child of the age of 12 or less, under G.S. 14-27.2(a)(1). State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 629</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 375 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The offense of assaulting a child under the age of 12, G.S. 14-33(b)(3), is not, as a matter of law, a lesser included offense of first-degree rape of a child of the age of 12 or less, under G.S. 14-27.2(a)(1). State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 629</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 375 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The offense of taking indecent liberties with a child under the age of 16, G.S. 14-202.1, is not, as a matter of law, a lesser included offense of first-degree rape of a child of the age of 12 or less, under G.S. 14-27.2(a)(1). State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 629</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 375 (1982), overruling State v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 616</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 439 (1977).

       <p>
        Larceny Pursuant to Breaking or Entering.
   
   - While it is error for the court to permit the jury to convict based on some abstract theory not supported by the bill of indictment, an indictment charging defendant with larceny pursuant to a burglary was sufficient to uphold defendant's conviction for larceny pursuant to a breaking or entering, as felonious breaking or entering is a lesser degree of the offense of second degree burglary, and this section provides that upon the trial of any indictment the prisoner may be convicted of the crime charged therein or of a lesser degree of the same crime. State v. McCoy, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 339 S.E.2d 419 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Felony Murder While Discharging Firearm into Occupied Building.
   
   - In felony murder trial for murder committed during the act of discharging a firearm into an occupied building, a felony under G.S. 14-34.1, where defendant's sole and unequivocal defense was that he was nowhere near the area on the night in question, an instruction on the offense of involuntary manslaughter was not warranted by the evidence. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 550</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 569 (1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 951, 110 S. Ct. 2215, 109 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Assault with Intent to Commit Rape.
   
   - Where the evidence was sufficient to carry the case to the jury upon the charge of assault with intent to commit rape under former G.S. 14-22 but the jury returned a verdict of guilty of an assault upon a female, the defendant being a male person over 18 years of age, such verdict was authorized by this section. State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 549</cite>, 35 S.E.2d 621 (1945).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Crimes Against Nature.
   
   - In a prosecution for the crime against nature, the accused may be convicted of the offense charged therein or the attempt to commit the offense. State v. Harward, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 746</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 691 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sodomy.
   
   - An assault upon a woman is not a less degree of the crime of sodomy. State v. Jernigan, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 732</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 711 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Assault with a Deadly Weapon.
   
   - Where a warrant charges a criminal assault with a deadly weapon, specifying the weapon, the jury is empowered to convict of simple assault, a less degree of the same crime, where the evidence warrants the verdict. State v. Gooding, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 175</cite>, 110 S.E.2d 865 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assault with a deadly weapon is an essential element of the felony created and defined by G.S. 14-32, being an included less degree of the same crime. State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 681</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 633 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Assault with a Deadly Weapon with Intent to Kill.
   
   - In prosecution for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, the court's instruction that the jury might find defendant guilty of a less degree of the crime, including assault with a deadly weapon, if they so found beyond a reasonable doubt, is without error. State v. Elmore, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 531</cite>, 193 S.E. 713 (1937); State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 54</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 895 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment sufficiently charging defendant with assault with a deadly weapon, to wit, a pistol, with intent to kill and inflicting serious injury not resulting in death, includes the offense of assault with a deadly weapon. State v. Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 521</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 34 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Aggravated Assault.
   
   - Simple assault is a lesser degree of the crime of aggravated assault. State v. Jeffries, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 218, 164 S.E.2d 398 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Burglary in the First Degree.
   
   - In a prosecution for burglary in the first degree, it is permissible for the jury to convict the defendant of an attempt to commit burglary in the second degree. State v. Surles, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 272</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 880 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        A violation of G.S. 14-54 is a less degree of the felony of burglary in the first degree. State v. Fikes, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 780</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 277 (1967); State v. Gaston, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 575, 167 S.E.2d 510 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the bill of indictment returned by the grand jury charged all elements of burglary in the first degree, the bill of indictment would have supported a verdict of guilty of either first-degree burglary or second-degree burglary as the evidence might warrant. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 115</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 453 (1971), overruled on other grounds, State v. Hickey, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 451</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 646 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Breaking and Entering.
   
   - Any person who breaks or enters any building described in G.S. 14-54, with intent to commit any felony or larceny therein, is guilty of a felony. A wrongful breaking or entering into such building, without the intent to commit any felony therein, is a misdemeanor, a lesser included offense within the meaning of this section. State v. Dozier, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 740, 200 S.E.2d 348 (1973), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 618</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 690 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Arson.
   
   - The felony created by G.S. 14-67 is a lesser included offense of the crime of arson. State v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 751</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 646 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Armed Robbery.
   
   - An indictment for armed robbery under G.S. 14-87 will support a verdict of guilty of common-law robbery. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 406, 170 S.E.2d 137 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for robbery with firearms, an accused may be acquitted of the major charge and convicted of an included or lesser offense, such as common-law robbery, or assault, or larceny from the person, or simple larceny, if a verdict for the included or lesser offense is supported by allegations of the indictment and by evidence on the trial. State v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 163 S.E.2d 125 (1968); State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 191</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 458 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conviction of armed robbery, pursuant to G.S. 14-87, had to be reversed because defendant used only his hands in the robbery and, thus, the evidence was not sufficient to support the conviction of armed robbery; however, pursuant to G.S. 15-170, there was sufficient evidence for a conviction of the lesser included offense of common law robbery, as defendant stole a car from the victim with the use of force. State v. Staten, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 673, 616 S.E.2d 650 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1080, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Robbery.
   
   - Where the evidence was not sufficient to make out a case of common-law robbery, the court properly submitted the case on larceny from the person. State v. Kirk, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 68, 193 S.E.2d 377 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Larceny from the person is a lesser included offense of common-law robbery, and an indictment for common-law robbery will support a conviction for larceny from the person. State v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 283 S.E.2d 812 (1981), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 391</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 374 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony of defendants in a prosecution for robbery that they took the pistol from prosecuting witness to prevent him from harming them or some other person, requires the court to submit the question of each defendant's guilt of simple assault to the jury as a lesser offense included in the crime charged, since such verdict would be justified in the event the jury should find that defendants took the pistol without intent to steal it, but were not warranted in doing so on the principle of self-protection. State v. Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 229</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 410 (1948).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Misdemeanor of larceny is a less degree of the felony
   
   of larceny within the meaning of this section. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 372</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 91 (1962); State v. Summers, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 517</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 627 (1965); State v. Respass, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 137, 218 S.E.2d 227, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 733</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 352 (1975); State v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 276 S.E.2d 738 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Larceny from the Person.
   
   - Assault is not a less degree of the crime of larceny from the person. State v. Acrey, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 90</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 201 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Possession of Marijuana.
   
   - To prove the offense of possession of over one ounce of marijuana, the State must show possession and that the amount possessed was greater than one ounce. To prove the offense of possession with intent to sell or deliver marijuana, the State must show possession of any amount of marijuana and that the person possessing the substance intended to sell or deliver it. Thus, the two crimes each contain one element that is not necessary for proof of the other crime. One is not a lesser included offense of the other. State v. Gooch, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 294 S.E.2d 13, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 253</cite>, 297 S.E.2d 599 (1982).
   <br />

       <p>
        Barratry.
   
   - An attempt to commit barratry is an offense in this State and a defendant may be convicted of an attempt to commit the offense upon an indictment charging the common-law offense of barratry. State v. Batson, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 411</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 511, 139 A.L.R. 614 (1941).

   - See State v. Kirksey, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 445</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 613 (1947); State v. Talbert, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 718</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 822 (1973); State v.

      <p>
       Section Codifies Rule That Verdict Specify Degree.
   
   - In requiring the jury to determine the degree of homicide of which defendant is guilty, this section merely codified the well-established rule that a verdict which leaves the matter in conjecture will not support a judgment. State v. Talbert, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 718</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 822 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Object of Section.
   
   - The object of this section is, of course, to place it beyond doubt in what degree of murder the prisoner was convicted. State v. Wiggins, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 813</cite>, 89 S.E. 58 (1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the requirement that the jury determine whether one charged under the statutory form is guilty of murder in the first or second degree was merely to eliminate that uncertainty when the defendant's plea was not guilty. State v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 17</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 800, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1000, 94 S. Ct. 353, 38 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Section Applies to All Indictments for Murder.
   
   - This section applies to all indictments for murder, whether perpetrated by means of poisoning, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, torture, or otherwise. State v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 621</cite>, 55 S.E. 342 (1906); State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 340</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 743 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Section Only Incidentally Related to Death Penalty.
   
   - The statutory requirement that the jury determine the degree of murder of which a defendant is guilty is only incidentally related to the death penalty. State v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 17</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 800, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1000, 94 S. Ct. 353, 38 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty Imposed by Section.
   
   - By this section it is made the duty of the jury alone to determine in their verdict whether the crime is murder in the first or second degree. State v. Gadberry, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 811</cite>, 23 S.E. 477 (1895); State v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 614</cite>, 72 S.E. 1075 (1911); State v. Bagley, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 608</cite>, 73 S.E. 995 (1912).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Record Must Show.
   
   - The record must show that the jurors have determined in their verdict where the crime is murder in the first or second degree, in order that there may be a proper judgment. State v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 825</cite>, 32 S.E. 962 (1899); State v. Truesdale, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 696</cite>, 34 S.E. 646 (1899).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence at Trial Determines Charge to Jury.
   
   - Where all the evidence at a trial for murder tends to show murder in the first degree in that the murder was committed by poisoning, starvation, lying in wait, imprisonment, torture, or in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate a felony, the trial court may instruct the jury that they may render only one of two verdicts, murder in the first degree, or not guilty. But where the evidence tends to show that the killing was with a deadly weapon, and the State in one phase of its case relies on premeditation and deliberation, the presumption is that the murder was in the second degree, with the burden of proving premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt on the State, in order to constitute it murder in the first degree, and under these circumstances it is error for the trial court to fail to charge the jury that they might find the prisoner guilty of murder in the second degree. State v. Newsome, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 552</cite>, 143 S.E. 187 (1928); State v. Gause, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 26</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 463 (1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the entire evidence shows, and no other reasonable inference can be fairly drawn therefrom, that the murder was committed either by lying in wait or in an attempt to perpetrate a felony, and the controverted question is the identity of prisoner as the murderer, the trial judge does not commit error in charging the jury to render a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree or not guilty. State v. Spevey, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 676</cite>, 65 S.E. 995 (1909); State v. Wiggins, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 813</cite>, 89 S.E. 58 (1916).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Verdict must be construed according to the charge
   
   and the evidence and when these make it certain beyond question, the law has been complied with. State v. Gilchrist, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 673</cite>, 18 S.E. 319 (1893); State v. Wiggins, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 813</cite>, 89 S.E. 58 (1916).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Procedure upon Failure to Determine Degree.
   
   - Where the degree of murder is not expressed in the verdict, the judge should tell the jury to reconsider their finding, for the purpose of specifying the crime, and upon response being made by them of murder in the first degree, the verdict is properly recorded accordingly. State v. Bagley, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 608</cite>, 73 S.E. 995 (1912).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Verdict of "guilty as charged" in prosecution under G.S.
   
   15-144 is sufficient to support the judgment when the judge has instructed the jury to return a verdict of murder in the first degree or not guilty and there was no evidence to warrant a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree or manslaughter. In such a situation the verdict will be taken with reference to the charge and the evidence in the case and interpreted as a verdict of guilty of the only charge submitted. This is an application of the general rule that a verdict apparently ambiguous may be given significance and correctly interpreted by reference to the allegations, the facts in evidence, and the instructions of the court. State v. Talbert, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 718</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 822 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       When, in a prosecution for homicide upon an indictment drawn under G.S. 15-144, the judge accepts a verdict of "guilty as charged" after having instructed the jury that it might return a verdict of guilty of murder in the first or second degree, or guilty of murder in either degree or manslaughter, such a verdict on such an indictment cannot be sustained. In such case the verdict is a general one without a response as to what grade of homicide the defendant was guilty, and a new trial must be ordered. State v. Talbert, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 718</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 822 (1973).

       § 15-173. Demurrer to the evidence.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When on the trial of any criminal action in the superior or district court, the State has introduced its evidence and rested its case, the defendant may move to dismiss the action, or for judgment as in case of nonsuit. If the motion is allowed, judgment shall be entered accordingly; and such judgment shall have the force and effect of a verdict of "not guilty" as to such defendant. If the motion is refused and the defendant does not choose to introduce evidence, the case shall be submitted to the jury as in other cases, and the defendant may on appeal urge as ground for reversal, the trial court's denial of his motion without the necessity of the defendant's having taken exception to such denial.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the defendant introduces evidence, he thereby waives any motion for dismissal or judgment as in case of nonsuit which he may have made prior to the introduction of his evidence and cannot urge such prior motion as ground for appeal. The defendant, however, may make such motion at the conclusion of all the evidence in the case, irrespective of whether or not he made a motion for dismissal or judgment as in case of nonsuit theretofore. If the motion is allowed, or shall be sustained on appeal, it shall in all cases have the force and effect of a verdict of "not guilty." If the motion is refused, the defendant may on appeal, after the jury has rendered its verdict, urge as ground for reversal the trial court's denial of his motion made at the close of all the evidence without the necessity of the defendant's having taken exception to such denial.

       <p>
        Necessity of Moving for Judgment or Dismissal at Trial.
   
   - Although G.S. 15A-1446(d)(5) allows a defendant to appeal on insufficiency of evidence grounds, notwithstanding the fact that no objection, exception or motion was made at trial, this statute is negated by N.C.R.A.P., Rule 10(b)(3), which states that a defendant may not assign as error the insufficiency of the evidence to prove the crime charged unless he moves to dismiss the action or for judgment as in case of nonsuit at trial. State v. Jordan, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 714</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 617 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Means of Raising Objection That Evidence Is Insufficient for Jury.
   
   - Objection that the evidence is not sufficient to carry the case to the jury must be raised by motion to nonsuit under this section, or by prayer for instructions to the jury, and may not be raised after verdict by motion for new trial or motion in arrest of judgment. State v. Gaston, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 499</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 311 (1952); State v. Wiggs, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 507</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 84 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The objection that the evidence is not sufficient to carry the case to the jury must be raised during the trial by a motion for a compulsory nonsuit under this section or by a prayer for instruction to the jury. State v. Glover, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 319</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 305 (1967); State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 121</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 779 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a criminal case the proper motion to test the sufficiency of the State's evidence to carry the case to the jury is a motion to dismiss the action or a motion for judgment as in case of nonsuit. State v. Dickens, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 537</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 844 (1971); State v. Everette, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 67</cite>, 199 S.E.2d 409 (1973); State v. Holton, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 391</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 612 (1973); State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 75, 226 S.E.2d 389, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 778</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 33 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion to dismiss under G.S. 15A-1227 is substantively identical to a motion for nonsuit under this section.
   
   State v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 349 S.E.2d 327 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion for Nonsuit Challenges Sufficiency of Evidence.
   
   - A motion for judgment as in case of nonsuit challenges the sufficiency of the State's evidence to warrant its submission to the jury and to support a verdict of guilty of the criminal offense charged in the warrant or indictment on which the prosecution is based. State v. Vaughan, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 105</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 31 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motion for nonsuit at the close of all the evidence draws into question the sufficiency of all of the evidence to go to the jury. State v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 219</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 443 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's later motion for nonsuit, made at the close of all the evidence, draws into question the sufficiency of all the evidence to go to the jury. State v. Barrow, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 227</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 693 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether correct or erroneous, a judgment of nonsuit has the force and effect of a verdict of "not guilty."
   
   State v. Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 479</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 372 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where indictments contain two separate charges and State takes a voluntary nonsuit upon the first count,
   
   defendant's contention that the nonsuit established his innocence of acts charged under that count which also constituted essential elements of the offense charged in the second count must be presented by a plea of former jeopardy or former acquittal, and not by motion for judgment as of nonsuit, under this section, and the failure of a plea of former jeopardy amounts to a waiver of his rights in the premises. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 295</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 898 (1946).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Submission of Lesser Degree upon Nonsuit on Offense Charged.
   
   - An instruction that the court grants a nonsuit on the offense charged in the indictment, followed by submission of the case on the question of defendants' guilt of a lesser degree of the offense charged, does not amount to a nonsuit on the indictment. State v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 617</cite>, 58 S.E.2d 625, cert. denied, 340 U.S. 838, 71 S. Ct. 24, 95 L. Ed. 615 (1950).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Judgment of Nonsuit on Subsequent Prosecution.
   
   - The granting of a motion under this section for judgment of nonsuit, or verdict of not guilty in a criminal prosecution charging defendant with willful neglect or refusal to support and maintain his illegitimate child, does not constitute an adjudication on the issue of paternity, and will not support a plea of former acquittal in a subsequent prosecution under G.S. 49-2. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 408</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 857 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Raising Question of Variance.
   
   - The defendant in a criminal action may raise the question of a variance between the indictment and the proof by a motion to dismiss the prosecution as in case of nonsuit. This is clearly set forth in State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 697</cite>, 86 S.E. 774 (1915); State v. Harbert, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 760</cite>, 118 S.E. 6 (1923); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 306</cite>, 141 S.E. 883 (1928); State v. Grace, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 280</cite>, 145 S.E. 399 (1928); State v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 511</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 871, cert. denied, 342 U.S. 831, 72 S. Ct. 56, 96 L. Ed. 629 (1951); State v. Overman, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 464</cite>, 125 S.E.2d 920 (1962); State v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 25</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 741 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion Sustained Where Variance Fatal.
   
   - Where there is a fatal variance between the indictment and the proof, it is proper to sustain the demurrer to the evidence, or to dismiss the action as in case of nonsuit. State v. Franklin, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 157</cite>, 167 S.E. 569 (1933). See also State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 636</cite>, 155 S.E. 447 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even in child sexual abuse cases, a variance as to time becomes material and of the essence when it deprives a defendant of an opportunity to adequately present his defense; while time variances do not always prejudice a defendant so as to require dismissal, even when an alibi is involved, when the defendant relies on the date set forth in the indictment, but the State's evidence substantially varies to the prejudice of defendant's alibi defense, the interests of justice and fair play require that the defendant's motion for dismissal be granted. In a child abuse case where the State's proof failed to show that alleged abuse occurred on the dates in the indictment, where the defendant had relied on those dates in building his alibi defense, and where all the evidence presented at trial went to sexual encounters over a period of years that ended a significant period of time prior to the dates listed in the indictment, defendant's motion to dismiss should have been granted, and defendant's conviction was reversed on appeal. State v. Custis, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 591 S.E.2d 895 (2004).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        G.S. 15A-1227 Compared.
   
   - Both this section and G.S. 15A-1227 allow motions to dismiss to be made at the close of the State's evidence. However, they are not identical. This section provides that "If the defendant introduces evidence, he thereby waives any motion for dismissal or judgment as in case of nonsuit which he may have made prior to the introduction of his evidence and cannot urge such prior motion as ground for appeal." Although no such provision is contained in G.S. 15A-1227, its enactment did not create a new type of motion to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. State v. Mendez, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 256 S.E.2d 405 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        A challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction is still properly made by either a motion for dismissal or a motion for judgment as in the case of nonsuit. Both motions were known to the law for many years prior to the enactment of G.S. 15A-1227. The motion for dismissal referred to in G.S. 15A-1227 is the same motion for dismissal referred to in this section. Therefore, there is but one motion for dismissal for insufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, and that motion is governed by the provisions of both this section and G.S. 15A-1227. State v. Mendez, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 256 S.E.2d 405 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Cases Under This Section Applicable to G.S.
   
   15A-1227. - A motion for dismissal under G.S. 15A-1227 is identical to a motion to dismiss the action, or for judgment as in the case of nonsuit, under this section in this respect: both statutes allow counsel to make a motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence at the close of the State's evidence or at the close of all the evidence. Hence, cases dealing with the sufficiency of the evidence to withstand the latter motion made under the older statute, this section, are applicable when ruling on motions made under the more recent statute, G.S. 15A-1227. State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion to dismiss under G.S. 15A-1227(a)(1) for insufficiency of the evidence
   
   to go to the jury is tantamount to a motion for nonsuit under this section. State v. Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 273</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 510 (1985); State v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 429</cite>, 355 S.E.2d 474 (1987); State v. Stocks, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 437</cite>, 355 S.E.2d 492 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Difference in Motions to Dismiss and for Judgment as in Case of Nonsuit.
   
   - As used in this section, there is no difference in legal significance between a motion "to dismiss the action" and a motion "for judgment as in case of nonsuit." State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 283</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 266 (1969); State v. Everhart, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 700</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 604 (1977); State v. Lindsay, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 263 S.E.2d 364 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion to dismiss will be treated the same as a motion for judgment of nonsuit. State v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 219</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 443 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion for directed verdict of not guilty treated as motion for judgment of nonsuit
   
   under this section. State v. Holton, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 391</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 612 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion for judgment of nonsuit and the motion for a directed verdict of not guilty have the same legal effect. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 422</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 113 (1975); State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 403</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 234, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Test for Granting Them Is the Same.
   
   - The standard governing the granting or not of a motion as of nonsuit is the same with regard to a motion for a directed verdict. State v. Flannery, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 617, 230 S.E.2d 603 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test of the sufficiency of the evidence to withstand motions for a directed verdict and for judgment of nonsuit is the same. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 403</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 234, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Arrest of Judgment and Judgment of Nonsuit Compared.
   
   - An order for arrest of judgment is based upon the insufficiency of the indictment or other defect appearing on the face of the record and it is appealable by the State; a judgment of nonsuit, on the other hand, has the force and effect of verdict of not guilty, and the State may not appeal. State v. Pinkney, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 316, 212 S.E.2d 907 (1975).

        Civil and Criminal Actions Compared.
   
   - This section serves, and was intended to serve, the same purpose in criminal prosecutions as was accomplished by former G.S. 1-183, in civil actions. State v. Fulcher, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 663</cite>, 113 S.E. 769 (1922); State v. Sigmon, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 684</cite>, 130 S.E. 854 (1925); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Former G.S. 1-183 was the statute setting forth the procedure to make a motion for judgment of compulsory nonsuit in civil actions and this section is the statute setting forth the procedure to make a motion for judgment of compulsory nonsuit in criminal actions. Jenkins v. Hawthorne, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 672</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 339 (1967).

       <p>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Question Presented.
   
   - The question for the court in considering a motion for judgment of nonsuit is whether there is reasonable basis upon which the jury might find that an offense charged in the indictment has been committed and the defendant is the perpetrator, or one of the perpetrators, of it. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 154</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 866 (1971); State v. Covington, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 313</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 629 (1976); State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 527</cite>, 234 S.E.2d 615 (1977); State v. Hyatt, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 623, 233 S.E.2d 649, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 733</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 786 (1977); State v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 18</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 125 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion for nonsuit presents only the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to carry the case to the jury. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 40</cite>, 110 S.E.2d 609 (1959); State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 593</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 728, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 820, 83 S. Ct. 36, 9 L. Ed. 2d 60 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test on a motion to dismiss is whether sufficient evidence has been presented to support a finding by the jury that defendant committed an offense with which he is charged. State v. Church, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 365, 258 S.E.2d 812 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion for nonsuit brings in question the sufficiency of all the evidence to take the case to the jury. State v. Sallie, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 186 S.E.2d 667, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 316</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 900 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        On a motion to nonsuit the question is whether, when all of the evidence is considered, there is substantial evidence to support a finding both that an offense charged in the bill of indictment has been committed and that the defendant committed it. State v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 712</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 185 (1976); State v. Burke, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 577, 244 S.E.2d 477 (1978); State v. Riddle, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 744</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 80 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon motion for judgment as of nonsuit in a criminal prosecution, the questions before the court are whether there is substantial evidence of each essential element of the crime charged, and whether the accused was the perpetrator of the charged offense. State v. Bush, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 159</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 333, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976); State v. Lindsay, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 263 S.E.2d 364 (1980); State v. LeDuc, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 269 S.E.2d 220 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 62</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 607 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the defendant's motion for judgment of nonsuit in a criminal action, the question for the court is whether there is substantial evidence of each essential element of the offense charged, or of a lesser offense included therein, and of the defendant's being the perpetrator of such offense. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 261, 231 S.E.2d 682 (1977); State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon motion for nonsuit, the question is whether there is substantial evidence - direct, circumstantial or both - to support a finding that the offense charged has been committed and that the accused committed it. State v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 219</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 443 (1977); State v. Barrow, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 227</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 693 (1977); State v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 578</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 458 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Question for the trial court on a motion to dismiss is whether, upon consideration of the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there is a reasonable basis upon which the jury might find that the crime charged has been committed and that defendant was a perpetrator of the crime. State v. Shelton, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 632, 281 S.E.2d 684 (1981), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 306</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 707 (1982); State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 87</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 450 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        On a motion for nonsuit the sole question for decision is whether upon a consideration of all the evidence admitted - whether competent or incompetent - in the light most favorable to the State, there is substantial evidence to support the finding that the offenses charged in the bills of indictment were committed by defendant. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 406</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 680 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the court is to rule upon a demurrer to the evidence in a criminal case, it is required merely to ascertain whether there is any competent evidence to sustain the allegations of the indictment, the evidence being construed in the light most favorable to the State. State v. Murdock, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 224</cite>, 34 S.E.2d 69 (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        When ruling on a defendant's motion to dismiss, the question for the court is whether substantial evidence which will support a reasonable inference of the defendant's guilt has been introduced. In deciding this question, the trial court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 186, 278 S.E.2d 535, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 591</cite>, 292 S.E.2d 16 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the motion for nonsuit calls into question the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence, the question for the court is whether a reasonable inference of defendant's guilt may be drawn from the circumstances. If so, it is for the jury to decide whether the facts, taken singly or in combination, satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. State v. Mapp, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 574, 264 S.E.2d 348 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        On motion to nonsuit, the court is required merely to ascertain whether there is any competent evidence to sustain the allegations of the indictment. State v. Landin, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 20</cite>, 182 S.E. 689 (1935). See also State v. Lefevers, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 494</cite>, 5 S.E.2d 552 (1939); State v. Alston, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 341</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 3 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering a motion to dismiss, it is the duty of the court to ascertain whether there is substantial evidence of each essential element of the offense charged. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 71</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 164 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        On a motion for nonsuit or dismissal, the court must determine whether there is substantial evidence of all the material elements of the offense charged. State v. Avery, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 675, 269 S.E.2d 708 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant moves under G.S. 15A-1227(a)(2) or under this section for dismissal at the close of all of the evidence, the trial court is to determine whether there is substantial evidence (a) of each essential element of the offense charged, or of a lesser offense included therein, and (b) of the defendant's being the perpetrator of the offense. State v. Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 273</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 510 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Question Presented - Circumstantial Evidence.
   
   - When the motion questions the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence, the question for the court is whether a reasonable inference of defendant's guilt may be drawn from the circumstances. State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 121</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 779 (1972); State v. Solomon, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 211 S.E.2d 478 (1975); State v. Shelton, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 632, 281 S.E.2d 684 (1981), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 306</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 707 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a motion is made for a judgment of nonsuit or for a directed verdict of not guilty, the trial judge must determine whether there is substantial evidence of every essential element of the offense, and it is immaterial whether the substantial evidence is circumstantial, or direct, or both. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 60</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 862 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the motion for nonsuit calls into question the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence, the question for the court is whether a reasonable inference of defendant's guilt may be drawn from the circumstances. If so, it is for the jury to decide whether the facts, taken singly or in combination, satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is actually guilty. State v. Rowland, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 353</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 661 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion Presents Question of Law for Court.
   
   - On motion for nonsuit, it is a question of law for the court to determine, in the first instance, whether the evidence adduced, when considered in its light most favorable to the State, is of sufficient probative force to justify the jury in drawing the affirmative inference of guilt. State v. Needham, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 555</cite>, 71 S.E.2d 29 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether the State has offered substantial evidence presents a question of law for the trial court. State v. McKinney, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 259, 210 S.E.2d 450 (1974), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 113</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 578 (1975); State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        To withstand defendant's motion for judgment as of nonsuit, there must be substantial evidence against the accused of every essential element that goes to make up the crime charged and whether the State has offered such substantial evidence presents a question of law for the court. State v. Allred, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 398</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 553 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Jury Question Presented.
   
   - If there is any evidence tending to prove the fact of guilt or which reasonably conduces to its conclusion as a fairly logical and legitimate deduction, and not such as merely raises a suspicion or conjecture of guilt, it is for the jury to say whether they are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the fact of guilt. State v. Marion, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 715</cite>, 158 S.E. 406 (1931); State v. Rhodes, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 438</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 917 (1960); State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 499</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 355 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Weight and Credibility of Evidence Are Jury Questions.
   
   - A demurrer to the evidence presents only the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to carry the case to the jury, the weight and credibility of the evidence being for the jury and not the court. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 400</cite>, 20 S.E.2d 360 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        When considering a motion for nonsuit the court is not concerned with the weight of the testimony but only with its sufficiency to carry the case to the jury and sustain the indictment. State v. McNeil, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 159</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 156 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon motion to dismiss under this section, it is required that the court ascertain merely where there is any sufficient evidence to sustain the allegations of the indictment and not whether it be true nor whether the jury should believe it. State v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 542</cite>, 146 S.E. 409 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court in considering motions under this section is concerned only with the sufficiency of the evidence to carry the case to the jury and not with its weight. The trial court's function is to test whether a reasonable inference of the defendant's guilt of the crime charged may be drawn from the evidence. State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 95</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 114 (1980); State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In ruling on a motion for nonsuit the court does not pass upon the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution, or take into account any evidence contradicting them offered by the defense. The court merely considers the testimony favorable to the State, assumes it to be true, and determines its legal sufficiency to sustain the allegations of the indictment. Whether the testimony is true or false, and what it proves if it be true, are matters for the jury. State v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 636</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 665 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering a motion for judgment as of nonsuit, the court is not concerned with the weight of the testimony, or with its truth or falsity, but only with the question of whether there is sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the offense charged has been committed and that defendant committed it. State v. Hines, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 377</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 201 (1975); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 229 S.E.2d 839 (1976), further review denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 712</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 138 (1981); State v. Flannery, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 617, 230 S.E.2d 603 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The reconciliation of any apparent discrepancy in the testimony, the weight of the evidence, and the credibility of the witnesses are all matters for the jury and not the court. State v. Reeves, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 427</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 9 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        The credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony is exclusively a matter for the jury. State v. Keller, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 273 S.E.2d 741, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 400</cite>, 279 S.E.2d 354 (1981).

        When Motion Allowed.
   
   - When all the evidence, that of the State and that of the defendant, is to the same effect and tends only exculpate the defendant, his motion for judgment as of nonsuit should be allowed. State v. McWilliams, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 680</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 476 (1971); State v. Atwood, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 266</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 543 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the evidence most favorable to the State is sufficient only to raise a suspicion or conjecture that the accused was the perpetrator of the crime charged in the indictment, the motion for judgment as in case of nonsuit should be allowed. State v. Poole, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 108</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 786 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        If, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the State, it is sufficient only to raise a suspicion or conjecture as to the commission of the offense, the motion for nonsuit should be allowed. State v. Atwood, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 266</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 543 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        If, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the State, it is sufficient only to raise a suspicion or conjecture as to either the commission of the offense or the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of it, the motion for nonsuit should be allowed, and this is true even though the suspicion aroused by the evidence is strong. State v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 712</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 185 (1976); State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere Suspicion of Guilt Warrants Dismissal.
   
   - When the facts and circumstances warranted by the evidence do no more than raise a suspicion of guilt, they are insufficient to make out a case and a motion to dismiss should be allowed. State v. Blizzard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 11</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 851 (1971); State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 472</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 132 (1975); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        On a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence, the court must find that there is substantial evidence, whether direct, circumstantial, or both, that the offense charged has been committed and that defendant committed it, in order to properly deny the motion; if, on the other hand, the evidence raises merely a suspicion or conjecture as to either the commission of the offense or defendant's identity as the perpetrator, the motion should be allowed. State v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 155, 272 S.E.2d 603 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a motion for judgment as of nonsuit or a motion to dismiss is lodged in a criminal action, the court must consider all the evidence actually admitted, whether competent or incompetent, in the light most favorable to the State. All contradictions or discrepancies must be resolved in its favor, and it must be given the benefit of every reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence. When all the evidence is so considered, it is for the court to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that the charged offense has been committed and that the defendant was the perpetrator of the offense. If, when so considered, the evidence is only sufficient to raise a suspicion or conjecture that the offense has been committed or that the defendant committed the charged offense, then the motion for judgment as of nonsuit or the motion to dismiss should be allowed. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 41</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 191 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a complete defense is established by the State's case,
   
   on a criminal indictment, the defendant should be allowed to avail himself of a motion for nonsuit under this section. State v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 79</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 456 (1943); State v. Watts, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 771</cite>, 32 S.E.2d 348 (1944); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        When the State's evidence presents a complete defense, a defendant's motion for nonsuit should be allowed. State v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 349 S.E.2d 327 (1986).

       </p>
       <p>
        When Motion Denied.
   
   - A motion to dismiss or as of nonsuit upon the evidence in a criminal case will be denied if the evidence is sufficient, considered in the light most favorable to the State, to prove guilty of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Sigmon, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 684</cite>, 130 S.E. 854 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule to be applied when considering whether the State has introduced sufficient evidence to withstand a motion for nonsuit is well settled in this jurisdiction. A motion for nonsuit is properly denied when there is any evidence, whether introduced by the State or defendant, which will support the charges contained in the bill of indictment or warrant, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and drawing every reasonable inference, deducible from the evidence, in favor of the State. State v. Everhart, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 700</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 604 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        On a motion for judgment of nonsuit the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable for the State, and if there be any competent evidence to support the charge contained in the bill of indictment the case is one for the jury. State v. Scoggins, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 71</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 473 (1945); State v. Block, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 661</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 243 (1957); State v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 746</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 506 (1974); State v. Yancey, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 656</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 637 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        If, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the State, there is evidence from which a jury could find that the offense charged has been committed and that defendant committed it, the motion to nonsuit should be overruled. State v. McKenna, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 668</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 537, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 912, 97 S. Ct. 301, 50 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion for directed verdict or for judgment of nonsuit should be denied when, upon such consideration of the evidence, there is substantial evidence to support a finding that an offense charged in the bill of indictment has been committed and the defendant committed it. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 403</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 234, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        If there is substantial evidence, whether direct, circumstantial, or both, of all material elements of the offense charged, then the motion for nonsuit must be denied and it is then for the jury to determine whether the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Coble, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 210 S.E.2d 118 (1974); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 247 S.E.2d 630 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 108</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 807 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion to nonsuit should be denied if there is substantial evidence tending to prove each essential element of the offense charged. This rule applies whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial, or a combination of both. State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 380</cite>, 93 S.E.2d 431 (1956); State v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 18</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 125 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motion must be denied if the State has offered substantial evidence against defendant of every element of the crime charged. State v. Porter, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 680</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 377 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether the evidence is direct, circumstantial, or both, if there is evidence from which a jury could find that the offense charged has been committed and that defendant committed it, the motion to nonsuit should be overruled. State v. Cummings, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 374</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 277 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        When there is sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which the jury could find that the charged offense has been committed and that defendant was the person who committed it, the motion should be denied. State v. McNeil, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 159</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 156 (1971); State v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 10, 195 S.E.2d 581 (1973); State v.

       <p>
        Motion challenging the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to go to the jury should be denied if there is evidence, considered in the light most favorable to the State, from which the jury could find that a crime has been committed and that defendant committed it.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is any competent evidence to support the allegations of the indictment, the motion to dismiss is properly denied. State v. Shelton, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C.

        If there is any evidence tending to prove the fact of guilt, or which reasonably leads to that conclusion as a logical and legitimate deduction, the motion must be denied. State v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 219</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 443 (1977); State v. Barrow, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 227</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 693 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        If there be any evidence tending to prove the fact in issue, or which reasonably conduces to its conclusion as a fairly logical and legitimate deduction, and not merely such as raises a suspicion or conjecture in regard to it, the case should be submitted to the jury. State v. Bogan, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 99</cite>, 145 S.E.2d 374 (1965); State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion for judgment as of nonsuit should be denied if there is any evidence tending to prove the fact in issue, or which reasonably conduces the conclusion of guilt as a fairly logical and legitimate deduction, but evidence which merely raises a suspicion or conjecture of the fact of guilt is insufficient to be submitted to the jury. State v. Stephenson, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 258</cite>, 10 S.E.2d 819 (1940); State v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 79</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 456 (1943); State v. Kirkman, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 778</cite>, 32 S.E.2d 328 (1944); State v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 115</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 588 (1945); State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 780</cite>, 83 S.E.2d 904 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence for the prosecution is sufficient to make out a case, nonsuit on the ground that the defendant's evidence tended to establish a defense is properly denied. State v. Werst, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 330</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 835 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion for judgment of nonsuit must be denied, if there be any substantial evidence - more than a scintilla - to prove the allegations of the indictment. State v. Weinstein, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 645</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 920, cert. denied, 324 U.S. 849, 65 S. Ct. 689, 89 L. Ed. 1410 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        If there is any evidence which reasonably tends to show guilt of the offense charged and from which a jury might legitimately convict, a motion for nonsuit should be denied. State v. McWilliams, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 680</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 476 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in not dismissing the charges of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, as the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant intended to kill the man that defendant fired his semi-automatic gun at five times in rapid succession; however, four of the five charges should have been dismissed since the evidence only showed one assault, not five assaults. State v. Maddox, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 127, 583 S.E.2d 601 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a motion is not limited to a single count or to any one degree of the crimes charged,
   
   but is addressed to the entire bill or to both counts as a whole, it cannot be allowed to support either count or any degree of either count. State v. Marsh, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 101</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 684 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion for judgment as of nonsuit addressed to the entire bill is properly overruled if there is evidence sufficient to support a conviction of the crime charged or of an included crime. State v. Virgil, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 73</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 777 (1964); State v. Rowland, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 353</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 661 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When State offers evidence of corpus delicti in addition to defendant's extrajudicial confessions,
   
   the defendant's motion to nonsuit is correctly denied. State v. Whitfield, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 275 S.E.2d 540 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion will not lie for failure of the State to offer evidence of a nonessential averment
   
   in the indictment, when each essential element of the offense is supported by competent evidence. State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 661</cite>, 188 S.E. 73 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion Held Proper.
   
   - Motion to dismiss the charge of attempted first-degree murder was properly denied because the evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion that defendant acted with premeditation and deliberation. There was no provocation by the police officer, defendant fired multiple shots within a fairly close range towards the officer, which required separate pulls of the trigger, and defendant's own words demonstrated his intent to kill. State v. Mack, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 595, 589 S.E.2d 168 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charges because, although defendant's actions while driving were not impaired by alcohol, they were still sufficient to establish the culpable negligence needed to support both involuntary manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. A witness noticed inappropriate driving by both defendant and the decedent prior to their vehicles approaching a sharp curve, as they approached the curve, defendant attempted to pass the decedent and the witness despite having no visibility around the curve, and defendant's attempt to pass the vehicles at that particular time was in blatant disregard of safety concerns associated with that portion of the highway and a violation of G.S. 20-150. State v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 589 S.E.2d 379 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 241</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 33 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        State presented sufficient evidence to survive G.S. 15-173 motion to dismiss kidnapping charges in capital murder case where a defendant and codefendant confined, restrained, or removed the victim for the purpose of doing serious bodily harm to or terrorizing the victim, resulting in serious injury to the victim including putting the victim in the victim's car trunk and then burning the car; the jury was not required to unanimously find any one of the "either/or" kidnapping predicates, as long as there was evidence for them to find at least one of the predicates - "unanimity" was not required. State v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 1</cite>, 603 S.E.2d 93 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of attempted murder of an infant child as the State of North Carolina presented sufficient evidence of defendant's specific intent to kill the child by showing that defendant carjacked a woman and her infant child, drove the woman and her infant child to a deserted area, raped the woman, beat the woman to death, and drove away while leaving the child behind in his diapers on a hot day in grass a foot tall at the deserted area. Additionally, a pediatric critical care expert testified that the infant's injuries, especially sunburns, were life-threatening and that if the infant had not been found by a passerby before nightfall he could have died as a result of exposure and dehydration. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 490, 621 S.E.2d 333 (2005).

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Scope of Appellate Review.
   
   - On appeal in criminal cases the Supreme Court cannot pass upon the weight of evidence, but only upon whether there is sufficient evidence to support conviction. State v. Shoup, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 69</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 697 (1946).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court Not to Weigh Evidence.
   
   - This section provides that if on the motion the judgment of nonsuit is allowed on appeal, it shall, in all cases, have the force and effect of a verdict of not guilty. This is not, therefore, the case of a new trial for some error of the judge, but is a verdict by the court of not guilty, which theretofore was without precedent. But the statute certainly did not intend that the Supreme Court should weigh the evidence and render a verdict. State v. Cooke, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 731</cite>, 97 S.E. 171 (1918).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Reversal of Judgment of Guilty.
   
   - Under the provisions of this section the reversal of a judgment of guilty has the force and effect of a verdict of "not guilty." State v. Corey, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 209</cite>, 153 S.E. 923 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's motion to nonsuit was allowed in the Supreme Court, this ruling was tantamount to a verdict of not guilty. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 748</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 901 (1953); State v. Wooten, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 117</cite>, 79 S.E.2d 254 (1953).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal of Denial of Motion Without Exception in Record.
   
   - A defendant may properly present on appeal the questions enumerated in N.C.R.A.P., Rule 10(a) without taking any exceptions or making any assignments of error in the record and may properly present for review the denial of his motion for nonsuit under this section without making any exception in the record. However, in both these situations, the defendant must still bring those questions forward in his brief, argue them and cite authorities in support of his arguments. Failure to do so means that those questions are not properly presented for review. State v. Samuels, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 783</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 427 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Question on Appeal Where Defendant Offers Evidence.
   
   - Where defendant offers evidence, the only question on appeal is whether the court erred in the denial of the motion made by defendant at the close of all the evidence. State v. Leggett, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 358</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 533 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant offers evidence in his own behalf, his assignment of error must be directed to the court's refusal to grant his motion for compulsory nonsuit at the close of all the evidence. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 712, 171 S.E.2d 17 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The denial of defendant's motion to dismiss at the close of the State's evidence was not properly at issue on appeal, where defendant chose to offer evidence after his motion was denied and thereby waived appellate review of the trial judge's decision. State v. Rasor, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 577</cite>, 356 S.E.2d 328 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, a defendant who introduces evidence waives any motion for dismissal or nonsuit made prior to the introduction of his evidence and cannot urge the prior motion as grounds for appeal. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 404</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 329 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant chose to offer evidence after his motion to dismiss was denied, he thereby waived appellate review of the trial judge's decision. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 112</cite>, 371 S.E.2d 689 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant failed to renew his motion for dismissal at the close of all the evidence, defendant failed to preserve the issue of whether the court properly denied his motion to dismiss the charges against him for appellate review. State v. Brunson, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 653 S.E.2d 552 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court Will Consider Only Denial of Motion Made at Close of All the Evidence.
   
   - Where defendant offered evidence after his motion for judgment as of nonsuit at the close of the State's evidence, the Supreme Court on appeal will consider only the denial of the motion made at the close of all the evidence, and the court must act in light of all the evidence. State v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 537</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 858 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Consideration of Entire Evidence on Appeal.
   
   - Where a defendant in a criminal action desires to except to the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him, his excepting, under this section, at the close of the State's evidence, and upon the overruling of his motion to nonsuit, excepting at the close of all the evidence, brings his exception to the Supreme Court on appeal upon the sufficiency of the entire evidence to convict, and is the proper procedure for that purpose. State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 365</cite>, 119 S.E. 755 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where both before and after he had introduced evidence, the defendant moved to dismiss the prosecution as in case of nonsuit, and duly excepted to the court's denial of his motion, the exceptions, therefore, required a consideration of the entire evidence. State v. Pasour, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 793</cite>, 111 S.E. 779 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        An exception to a motion to dismiss in a criminal action taken after the close of the State's evidence, and renewed by defendant after the introduction of his own evidence, does not confine the appeal to the State's evidence alone, and a conviction will be sustained under the second exception if there is any sufficient evidence on the whole record of the defendant's guilt. State v. Brinkley, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 720</cite>, 110 S.E. 783 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion as of nonsuit in a criminal case at the close of the State's evidence, renewed after all the evidence has been introduced, does not confine its sufficiency to the time of the first motion, and will be denied if there is sufficient evidence in the State's behalf viewing all the evidence in its entirety. State v. Earp, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 164</cite>, 145 S.E. 23 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon appeal from the denial of a motion as of nonsuit in a criminal action, review of the evidence is not confined to the State's evidence alone, but all the evidence in the State's favor, taken in the light most favorable to the State and giving it every reasonable intendment therefrom, will be considered, and where there is sufficient evidence of the defendant's guilt upon the whole record, the action of the trial judge in denying the motion of nonsuit will be upheld. State v. Lawrence, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 562</cite>, 146 S.E. 395 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        When upon the trial of a criminal action, the State produces its evidence and rests, and the defendant preserves his exception to the refusal of his motion for judgment as of nonsuit, and, after offering evidence and the case closed, defendant renews his motion for judgment as of nonsuit, the court must act, not only in the light of the evidence of the State, but of all the evidence; and, in such case, the defendant is entitled to the benefit only of his exception to the refusal of the latter motion. State v. Norton, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 418</cite>, 23 S.E.2d 301 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's exception to the denial of his motion to dismiss, made at the close of all of the evidence, presented the issue of the sufficiency of all of the evidence to go to the jury. Therefore, for purposes of reviewing this assignment of error, the court would consider all of the evidence introduced at trial, and would not determine whether that evidence was competent. State v. Evangelista, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 152</cite>, 353 S.E.2d 375 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Later Testimony of Codefendant Not Considered.
   
   - Where the defendant had not offered evidence, he was entitled to have his motion for nonsuit passed upon based on the facts in evidence when the State rested its case, and the Court of Appeals did not consider the later testimony of the codefendant. State v. Berryman, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 179 S.E.2d 875 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence was substantially similar to that introduced at former trial,
   
   decision of the Supreme Court on the former appeal that evidence was sufficient to be submitted to the jury is res judicata on question of nonsuit or sufficiency of evidence. State v. Stone, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 97</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 704 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's exception to the denial of his motion to dismiss, made at the close of all of the evidence, presented the issue of the sufficiency of all of the evidence to go to the jury. Therefore, for purposes of reviewing this assignment of error, the court would consider all of the evidence introduced at trial, and would not determine whether that evidence was competent. State v. Evangelista, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 152</cite>, 353 S.E.2d 375 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion to Dismiss Was Proper.
   
   - Defendant's motion to dismiss a conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon charge was properly denied as there was conflicting evidence as to whether a gun given to a person who committed a robbery (the actor) was real or not and there was sufficient evidence that the gun was an operable weapon where: (1) defendant and two other men told the actor to rob a store in exchange for drugs, which she agreed to do, (2) the men provided the actor with a gun and she committed the robbery, (3) the actor spoke primarily with defendant regarding the robbery, (4) the actor stated that one of the men told her that the gun was fake, but that she was uncertain whether it was fake, and (5) the actor stated that defendant and the others had a real gun and a fake gun and that she believed she had been given the fake one. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 629 S.E.2d 332 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the victim, defendant's girlfriend, stated that defendant was angry that she had called the police after she discovered her car was gone, and had strangled, raped, and threatened to kill her, and her testimony was corroborated by witnesses who saw her afterwards, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss. State v. Brunson, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 653 S.E.2d 552 (2007).

        Substantial evidence
   
   is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 71</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 164 (1980); State v. Porter, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 680</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 377 (1980); State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).

       </p>
       <p>
        Terms "more than a scintilla of evidence" and "substantial evidence" are in reality the same,
   
   and simply mean that the evidence must be existing and real, not just seeming or imaginary. State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "No Evidence to Go to Jury" Not Taken Literally.
   
   - When it is said that there is no evidence to go to the jury, it does not mean that there is literally and absolutely none, for as to this there could be no room for any controversy, but there is none which ought reasonably to satisfy the jury that the fact sought to be proved is established. State v. Woodell, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 635</cite>, 191 S.E. 334 (1937).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence Required to Withstand Motion.
   
   - There must be substantial evidence of all material elements of the offense to withstand the motion to dismiss. State v. Bogan, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 99</cite>, 145 S.E.2d 374 (1965); State v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 708</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 656 (1974); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Upon motions for directed verdict of not guilty and nonsuit, the court must find that there is substantial evidence both that an offense charged has been committed and that the defendant committed it before it can overrule the motions. State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 372</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 222, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976); State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 512</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 303, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 912, 97 S. Ct. 301, 50 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1976); State v. Avery, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 675, 269 S.E.2d 708 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        To withstand defendant's motion to dismiss, the State must have presented evidence of every essential element of the crime. State v. Church, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 365, 258 S.E.2d 812 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence May Be Either Circumstantial or Direct.
   
   - There must be substantial evidence of all material elements of the offense to withstand the motion to dismiss, and it is immaterial whether the substantial evidence is circumstantial or direct, or both. State v. Poole, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 108</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 786 (1974); State v. Minor, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 68</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 180 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test of the sufficiency of the evidence to withstand the motion for judgment of nonsuit is the same whether the evidence is circumstantial, direct or both. State v. Porter, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 680</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 377 (1980); State v. LeDuc, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 269 S.E.2d 220 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 62</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 607 (1982); State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Standard of Proof Not Same as for Conviction.
   
   - A trial judge, in passing upon a motion for a judgment as of nonsuit, under the provisions of this section is not bound by the measure or quantum of proof by which the State must prove a defendant's guilt before the jury can convict him. State v. Davenport, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 475</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 686 (1947).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence Need Not Exclude Every Reasonable Hypothesis of Innocence.
   
   - The trial court is not required to determine that the evidence excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence before denying a defendant's motion to dismiss. State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982); State v. Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 273</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 510 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Circumstantial Evidence Need Not Point Unerringly to Defendant's Guilt.
   
   - Where all of the evidence introduced by the State is circumstantial in nature, it is not necessary that such evidence must establish facts so connected and related as to point unerringly to defendant's guilt and exclude any other reasonable hypothesis, but only that there be substantial evidence of all elements of the crime sufficient to submit the case to the jury. State v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 14, 195 S.E.2d 569 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        There must be legal evidence of the fact in issue
   
   and not merely such as raises a suspicion or conjecture in regard to it. State v. Bass, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 318</cite>, 116 S.E.2d 772 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence Raising Suspicion Only.
   
   - Evidence that does no more than raise a suspicion, somewhat strong, perhaps, of a crime and the defendant's guilt, is not enough, and demurrer to the evidence will be sustained. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 304</cite>, 168 S.E. 204 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the State, on motion by defendants for judgment as of nonsuit in a criminal prosecution, raises no more than a suspicion as to the guilt of defendants, the same is insufficient to support a verdict of guilt and the motion must be allowed. State v. Heglar, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 220</cite>, 34 S.E.2d 76 (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        On the trial of several defendants, upon an indictment for robbery, where the evidence against one of the defendants raises no more than a suspicion of his guilt, a motion to dismiss as to such defendant should be allowed. State v. Ham, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 128</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 449 (1944).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere Possibility or Conjecture Insufficient.
   
   - Evidence which merely shows it possible for the fact in issue to be as alleged, or which raises a mere conjecture that it was so, is an insufficient foundation for a verdict and should not be left to a jury. State v. Glenn, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 156</cite>, 110 S.E.2d 791 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a motion for judgment of nonsuit the evidence is to be considered in the light most favorable for the State, but evidence which merely suggests the possibility of guilt or which raises only a conjecture is insufficient to require submission to the jury. State v. Guffey, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 60</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 734 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motion to dismiss must be considered in light of all the evidence
   
   introduced by the State, as well as that introduced by defendant. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 87</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 450 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Renewal of the motion to dismiss at the conclusion of all the evidence compels the court to consider the motion in light of all the evidence presented at trial. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 360 S.E.2d 291 (1987), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 475</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 924 (1988).

       <p>
        In passing upon a motion for judgment as of nonsuit, the trial judge must consider all the evidence admitted, whether competent or incompetent, in the light most favorable to the State, giving the State the benefit of every reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence and considering so much of defendant's evidence as may be favorable to the State. State v. Hines, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 377</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 201 (1975); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 229 S.E.2d 839 (1976), further review denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 712</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 138 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a motion as of nonsuit in a criminal action, made at the close of the State's evidence and renewed at the close of all of the evidence, all the evidence, whether offered by the State or elicited from defendant's witnesses, will be considered in the light most favorable to the State, and it is entitled to every reasonable intendment thereon and every reasonable inference therefrom, and only evidence favorable to the State will be considered, the weight and credibility of the evidence being for the jury. State v. Shipman, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 518</cite>, 163 S.E. 657 (1932); State v. Ammons, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 753</cite>, 169 S.E. 631 (1933); State v. Mann, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 212</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 247, 132 A.L.R. 1309 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering a motion to dismiss the action under the statute, the appellate court is merely to ascertain whether there is any evidence to sustain the indictment; and in deciding the question the appellate court must not forget that the State is entitled to the most favorable interpretation of the circumstances and all inferences that may fairly be drawn from them. State v. Carlson, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 818</cite>, 89 S.E. 30 (1916); State v. Rountree, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 535</cite>, 106 S.E. 669 (1921); State v. Carr, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 129</cite>, 144 S.E. 698 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon defendant's motion to dismiss, all the evidence favorable to the State must be considered, such evidence must be deemed true and considered in the light most favorable to the State, and the State is entitled to every inference of fact which may be reasonably deduced therefrom. State v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 327 S.E.2d 902, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 546</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 318 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant moves under G.S. 15A-1227(a)(2) or under this section for dismissal at the close of all the evidence, the trial court is to view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and give the state all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence supporting the charges against the defendant. State v. Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 273</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 510 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Renewal of the motion to dismiss at the conclusion of all the evidence compels the court to consider the motion in light of all the evidence presented at trial. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 360 S.E.2d 291 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether True or False.
   
   - For purposes of ruling on the motion, the court takes as true all of the State's evidence; whether the testimony is true or false and what it proves or fails to prove are matters for the jury. State v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 18</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 125 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Any contradictions and discrepancies in the evidence are resolved in favor of the State
   
   for the purpose of considering a motion for nonsuit. State v. Bush, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 159</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 333, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable Inferences Unfavorable to State Must Be Ignored.
   
   - If the trial court determines that a reasonable inference of the defendant's guilt may be drawn from the evidence, it must deny the defendant's motion for nonsuit and send the case to the jury even though the evidence may also support reasonable inferences of the defendant's innocence. State v. McNeil, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 533, 265 S.E.2d 416, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 560</cite>, 270 S.E.2d 114 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence favorable to the State is to be considered as a whole
   
   in determining its sufficiency. State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Only incriminating evidence need be considered upon defendant's motion as of nonsuit
   
   under this section, and contradictions in the inculpatory testimony and equivocations of some of the State's witnesses, which affects the weight or credibility of the evidence but not its competency, need not be taken into account in determining whether there is any competent evidence to sustain the allegations of the indictment. State v. Satterfield, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 118</cite>, 176 S.E. 466 (1934). See also State v. Moses, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 139</cite>, 176 S.E. 267 (1934).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's Evidence May Be Considered.
   
   - In considering a motion to dismiss made at the close of all the evidence, the defendant's evidence as well as the State's evidence may be considered. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 342 S.E.2d 530 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In reviewing a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of all the evidence, the court must consider any evidence presented by defendant which rebuts the inference of guilt, so long as it is not contradicted by any of the State's evidence. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 360 S.E.2d 291 (1987), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 475</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 924 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's Evidence Conflicting with State's Evidence Not Considered.
   
   - In considering a motion for judgment of nonsuit, evidence of the defendant which is favorable to the State is considered, but his evidence in conflict with that of the State is not considered. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 154</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 866 (1971); State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 230 S.E.2d 550 (1976); State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 667, 230 S.E.2d 429 (1976), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 260</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 393 (1977); State v. Cooley, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 268 S.E.2d 87, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 96</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 442 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In ruling on defendant's motions for nonsuit or for directed verdict of not guilty the trial judge must consider the State's evidence in the light most favorable to the State without considering the evidence of defendant in conflict therewith. State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 372</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 222, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        All of the evidence favorable to the State is considered, and defendant's evidence relating to matters of defense or defendant's evidence in conflict with that of the State is not considered. State v. McKinney, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 259, 210 S.E.2d 450 (1974), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 113</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 578 (1975); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 247 S.E.2d 630 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 108</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 807 (1979); State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 95</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 114 (1980); State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 139, 272 S.E.2d 916 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Is Considered Where It Explains or Clarifies State's Evidence.
   
   - On a demurrer to the evidence only the State's evidence is to be considered, and the defendant's evidence is not to be taken into account, unless it tends to explain or make clear that offered by the State. State v. Oldham, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 415</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 318 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        On a motion to nonsuit, the defendant's evidence which explains or makes clear the evidence of the State may be considered. State v. Blizzard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 11</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 851 (1971); State v. Atwood, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 266</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 543 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering a motion under this section, the defendant's evidence, unless favorable to the State, is not to be taken into consideration, except when not in conflict with the State's evidence, it may be used to explain or make clear that which has been offered by the State. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 420</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 186 (1952); State v. Sears, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 623</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 907 (1952); State v. Roop, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 607</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 363 (1961); State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 506</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 121 (1964); State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 60</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 862 (1971); State v. Sallie, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 186 S.E.2d 667, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 316</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 900 (1972); State v. Church, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 365, 258 S.E.2d 812 (1979); State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering a motion for nonsuit lodged at the close of all the evidence, any portion of defendant's evidence which is favorable to the State and any portion of defendant's evidence which explains or clarifies the State's evidence is to be considered; thus by omitting defendant's evidence from the record on appeal, defendant would deprive the State of the benefit of such portions of defendant's evidence, which are entitled to consideration. State v. Paschall, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 591, 188 S.E.2d 521 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Or Where Not Inconsistent with State's Evidence.
   
   - On a motion for nonsuit, defendant's evidence which rebuts the inference of guilt may be considered when it is not inconsistent with the State's evidence. State v. Blizzard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 11</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 851 (1971); State v. Atwood, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 266</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 543 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's evidence relating to matters in defense should not be considered
   
   on motion to nonsuit. State v. Avery, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 276</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 670 (1952); State v. Moseley, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 285</cite>, 111 S.E.2d 308 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only the evidence favorable to the State will be considered, and defendant's evidence relating to matters of defense, or defendant's evidence in conflict with that of the State, will not be considered. State v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 430</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 291 (1970); State v. Coble, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 210 S.E.2d 118 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conflicting Evidence.
   
   - Where evidence is conflicting in a criminal case and where, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the jury might find the defendant guilty, a motion as of nonsuit is properly denied. State v. Carr, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 129</cite>, 144 S.E. 698 (1928).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conflicts in State's Evidence.
   
   - When the substantive evidence offered by the State is conflicting - some tending to inculpate and some tending to exculpate the defendant - it is sufficient to repel a demurrer thereto. State v. Tolbert, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 445</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 201 (1954); State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 40</cite>, 110 S.E.2d 609 (1959); State v. Gay, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 78</cite>, 110 S.E.2d 458 (1959); State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 499</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 355 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conflicts Resolved in State's Favor.
   
   - Upon a motion for judgment of nonsuit the evidence offered by the State must be taken in the light most favorable to the State and conflicts therein must be resolved in the State's favor, the credibility and effect of such evidence being a question for the jury. State v. Church, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 534</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 624 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court must consider all of the evidence actually admitted in the light most favorable to the State, resolve any contradictions and discrepancies therein in the State's favor, and give the State the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the evidence. State v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 712</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 185 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        On a motion for nonsuit, the court considers all of the evidence actually admitted, whether from the State or defendant, in the light most favorable to the State, resolves any contradictions and discrepancies therein in the State's favor, and gives the State the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the evidence. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 169</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 531 (1976); State v. Aleem, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 359, 271 S.E.2d 575 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Contradictions and Discrepancies in Evidence Are for Jury to Resolve.
   
   - Contradictions and discrepancies, even in the State's evidence, are for the jury to resolve, and do not warrant nonsuit. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 626</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 826 (1965); State v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 430</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 291 (1970); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily contradictions and discrepancies bear solely upon the weight to be given the testimony of a witness, a matter within the province of the jury. State v. Allred, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 398</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 553 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        On demurrer to the evidence and motion to nonsuit, the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the State, and contradictions and discrepancies in the testimony of the State's witnesses are to be resolved by the jury. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 325</cite>, 93 S.E.2d 425 (1956); State v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 465</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 61 (1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 832, 81 S. Ct. 45, 5 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a motion for judgment of nonsuit, only the evidence favorable to the State is considered, and contradictions and discrepancies, even in the State's evidence, are matters for the jury and do not warrant nonsuit. State v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 1</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 845 (1971); State v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 708</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 656 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The conclusion of the court with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence is unaffected by defendant's contention that some of the State's evidence is contradictory and casts doubt on the credibility of the witnesses. Such contradictions and discrepancies are matters for the jury and do not warrant nonsuit. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 505</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 663 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contradictions and discrepancies in the testimony of the State's witnesses are to be resolved by the jury and, for the purposes of this motion, they are to be deemed by the court as if resolved in favor of the State. State v. LeDuc, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 269 S.E.2d 220 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 62</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 607 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contradictions and discrepancies in the evidence are for the jury to resolve and do not warrant dismissal. State v. Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 273</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 510 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Do Not Warrant Granting Motion.
   
   - On motion for judgment of nonsuit the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the State and contradictions and discrepancies therein do not warrant the granting of the motion. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 558</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 584 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Discrepancies in the State's evidence will not justify the granting of a motion for nonsuit. State v. Moseley, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 285</cite>, 111 S.E.2d 308 (1959).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Are Disregarded in Ruling on Motion.
   
   - For the purpose of ruling upon a motion for judgment as of nonsuit, the evidence for the State is taken to be true, every reasonable inference favorable to the State is to be drawn therefrom and discrepancies therein are to be disregarded. State v. Sellers, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 268</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 264 (1976); State v. Manuel, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 705</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 588 (1977); State v. Cooley, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 268 S.E.2d 87, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 96</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 442 (1980); State v. Keller, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 273 S.E.2d 741, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 400</cite>, 279 S.E.2d 354 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering a trial court's denial of a motion for judgment of nonsuit, the evidence for the State, considered in the light most favorable to it, is deemed to be true and inconsistencies or contradictions therein are disregarded. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 154</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 866 (1971); State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 230 S.E.2d 550 (1976); State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 667, 230 S.E.2d 429 (1976), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 266</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 393 (1977); State v. Hyatt, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 623, 233 S.E.2d 649, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 733</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 786 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a motion for judgment of nonsuit, the evidence for the State is taken to be true and the State is entitled to every reasonable inference which may be drawn therefrom, contradictions and discrepancies in the State's evidence are disregarded and the evidence of the defendant in conflict with that of the State is not taken into consideration. State v. Lampkins, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 497</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 106 (1975), cert. denied, 428 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 3220, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1216 (1976); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 422</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 113 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any contradictions and inconsistencies, when in the State's evidence, are to be disregarded by the court in considering a trial court's denial of a motion for judgment as of nonsuit. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 229 S.E.2d 839 (1976), further review denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 712</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 138 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Both Competent and Incompetent Evidence Considered.
   
   - Incompetent evidence admitted is considered as if it were competent in considering a motion for nonsuit. State v. Bush, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 159</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 333, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976); State v. LeDuc, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 269 S.E.2d 220 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 62</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 607 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Admitted evidence, whether competent or incompetent, must be considered in passing on defendant's motions for judgment as of nonsuit. State v. Virgil, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 73</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 777 (1964); State v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 269</cite>, 145 S.E.2d 833 (1966); State v. Accor, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 65</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 583 (1970); State v. Holton, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 391</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 612 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        All admitted evidence which is favorable to the State, whether competent or incompetent, must be taken into account and so considered by the court when ruling upon a motion for nonsuit. State v. Biggs, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 522</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 371 (1976); State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 505</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 663 (1977); State v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 219</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 443 (1977); State v. Barrow, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 227</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 693 (1977); State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 95</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 114 (1980); State v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 578</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 458 (1980); State v. Owen, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 276 S.E.2d 478 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 154</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 382 (1982); State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 62</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 649 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        All of the evidence actually admitted, whether competent or incompetent, which is favorable to the State must be taken into account and must be so considered by the court in ruling upon the motion for directed verdict or for judgment of nonsuit. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 403</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 234, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        All of the evidence actually admitted, whether competent or incompetent, including that offered by defendant, if any, which is favorable to the State, must be taken into account and so considered by the court in ruling upon a motion for nonsuit. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 712, 171 S.E.2d 17 (1969); State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 232 S.E.2d 475 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether there is evidence sufficient for the judge to submit a case to the jury, all admitted evidence favorable to the State, whether competent or incompetent, must be considered and must be deemed true. State v. Riddle, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 744</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 80 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Improperly Admitted Evidence.
   
   - Upon the consideration of a motion for judgment of nonsuit, evidence for the State, even though improperly admitted, is taken into account. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 422</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 113 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence which is inherently impossible or in conflict with indisputable physical facts or laws
   
   of nature is not sufficient to take the case to the jury. State v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 414</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 246 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence as to Accomplices and Codefendants.
   
   - The evidence of accomplices is sufficient to carry the case to the jury and to justify a refusal of motion to nonsuit. State v. Rising, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 747</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 221 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The direct evidence of the guilt of one of the defendants and the circumstantial evidence as to the other's participation and guilt, is held sufficient to overrule their motions as of nonsuit. State v. Ammons, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 753</cite>, 169 S.E. 631 (1933).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonsuit May Not Be Based on Ground That Testimony Was Incredible.
   
   - Nonsuit may not be granted on the ground that the testimony of the State's witnesses was incredible and unworthy of belief, the credibility of the witnesses being for the jury and not the court. State v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 374</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 107 (1950); State v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 636</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 665 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of Mere Opportunity to Commit Crime Insufficient.
   
   - Where the evidence for the State where the defendants are charged with fornication and adultery, shows no more than that the defendants had opportunities to commit the crime, on motion of the defendants, the action should be dismissed, and a verdict of not guilty, entered under this section. State v. Woodell, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 635</cite>, 191 S.E. 334 (1937).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When State's case must rest entirely on declarations made by defendant,
   
   and there is no evidence contra which does more than suggest a possibility of guilt or raise a conjecture, demurrer thereto should be sustained. In such case, the declarations of the defendant are presented by the State as worthy of belief, and when they are wholly exculpatory, the defendant is entitled to his acquittal. State v. Tolbert, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 445</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 201 (1954).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant May Rely upon Complete Defense Made Out by State's Evidence.
   
   - It is axiomatic that when a complete defense is made out by the State's evidence, a defendant should be allowed to avail himself of such defense on a demurrer to the evidence under this section. This is true even when the exculpating evidence is in the form of statements of defendant offered in evidence by the State. State v. Tolbert, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 445</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 201 (1954).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where State introduces declarations by defendant which present a complete defense
   
   while its evidence contra raises only a possibility of guilt, the defendant is entitled to acquittal upon his demurrer to the evidence. However, that the State, upon offering evidence of exculpatory declarations of a defendant, is not precluded from showing that the true facts differ from those related by the defendant and such conflicting evidence is sufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss. State v. Caudle, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 293 S.E.2d 205 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony by State witness that defendant made a declaration of innocence
   
   does not entitle defendant to judgment as of nonsuit, since such self-serving declaration does not rebut any proof by the State. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 295</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 898 (1946).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When State Bound by Defendant's Extrajudicial Statement.
   
   - When the State introduced the defendant's extrajudicial statement, it was bound by what he said except insofar as it was contradicted and shown to be false. State v. Bolin, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 415</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 235 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Fingerprints of Accused.
   
   - Evidence given by a qualified expert that fingerprints found at the scene of a crime correspond with those of an accused, when accompanied by substantial evidence of circumstances from which the jury can find that such fingerprints could have been impressed only at the time the offense was committed, is sufficient to withstand a motion for nonsuit. State v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 10, 195 S.E.2d 581 (1973); State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 1</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 572 (1975).

       <p>
        Effect of Defendant Introducing Testimony at Trial.
   
   - By introducing testimony at the trial, a defendant waives his right to except on appeal to the denial of his motion for nonsuit at the close of the State's evidence. His later exception to the denial of his motion for nonsuit made at the close of all the evidence, however, draws into question the sufficiency of all the evidence to go to the jury. State v. McWilliams, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 680</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 476 (1971); State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 75</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 858 (1978); State v. Evangelista, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 152</cite>, 353 S.E.2d 375 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant introduced evidence, he waived his right to except on appeal to the denial of his motion for nonsuit at the close of the State's evidence. State v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 708</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 656 (1974); State v. Logan, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 49, 212 S.E.2d 236 (1975); State v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 219</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 443 (1977); State v. Barrow, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 227</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 693 (1977); State v. Lilly, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 232 S.E.2d 495, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 643</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 64 (1977); State v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 162, 234 S.E.2d 482 (1977); State v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 276 S.E.2d 738 (1981); State v. Lilley, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 100, 337 S.E.2d 89 (1985), aff 'd, State v. Patrick, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 364 S.E.2d 450 (1988); State v. Patrick, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 364 S.E.2d 450 (1988); State v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 246 S.E.2d 846 (1978); State v. Guy, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 282 S.E.2d 560 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        By introducing evidence after the denial of his motion for judgment of nonsuit, made when the State had rested its case, defendant waived the motion for dismissal which he made prior to the introduction of his evidence. State v. Prince, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 769</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 897 (1967); State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 342 S.E.2d 530 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the defendant offers evidence, he waives a motion for nonsuit lodged, either actually or by statute, at the close of the State's evidence and only the motion lodged at the close of all the evidence is considered. State v. Paschall, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 591, 188 S.E.2d 521 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motions for nonsuit must be considered in light of all the evidence since he introduced evidence and thereby waived the motions made at the close of the State's evidence. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 406</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 680 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant offers evidence after his motion for judgment as of nonsuit is overruled, he thereby waives all right to urge that denial as error upon appeal. State v. McLamb, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 705, 187 S.E.2d 458, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 316</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 899 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        By introducing evidence defendant waived his motion to dismiss made at the close of the State's evidence, and having failed to renew his motion at the close of all evidence, defendant established no basis upon which to appeal denial of his motion. State v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 280 S.E.2d 636, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 197</cite>, 285 S.E.2d 103 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        By introducing evidence following denial of motion to dismiss made at the end of the State's case in chief, defendant waived the motion. State v. Melvin, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 291 S.E.2d 885, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 748</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 484 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion Must Be Renewed.
   
   - A motion as of nonsuit upon the evidence will not be considered when it is not renewed after the conclusion of all the evidence as this section requires. State v. Helms, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 566</cite>, 107 S.E. 228 (1921); State v. Kiziah, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 339</cite>, 8 S.E.2d 474 (1940).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exception to Denial of Motion.
   
   - Defendant's exception to the denial of his motion for nonsuit made at the close of all the evidence raises the question of the sufficiency of all the evidence to go to the jury. State v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 708</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 656 (1974); State v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 276 S.E.2d 738 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Renew Motion After Introducing Testimony.
   
   - Where the defendant in a criminal action moves for the dismissal or for judgment as of nonsuit after the close of the State's evidence, and thereafter elects to introduce his own evidence, his failure to renew his motion after the whole evidence has been introduced is a waiver of his right to insist upon his first motion, and it is not subject to review in the Supreme Court on Appeal. State v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 490</cite>, 122 S.E. 13 (1924). See also State v. Hargett, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 692</cite>, 146 S.E. 801 (1929); State v. Chapman, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 157</cite>, 19 S.E.2d 250 (1942); State v. Epps, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 741</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 219 (1943); State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 760</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 417 (1946).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Motion.
   
   - Where defendant's motion to dismiss made at the close of the State's evidence was denied, and following the denial of the motion, he put on evidence in his own behalf, and no motion was made at the conclusion of all the evidence, defendant, therefore, waived his prior motion and cannot bring it forward as appealable error. State v. Harden, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 677, 257 S.E.2d 635 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure of a defendant to renew his motion for nonsuit at the close of all the evidence constitutes a waiver of his right to insist upon his first motion for nonsuit, and it is not subject to review in the Supreme Court. State v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 657</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 625 (1964); State v. Fikes, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 780</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 277 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Having elected to offer evidence defendant waived her motion to dismiss at the close of the State's evidence, and proper consideration is thereafter upon her motion to dismiss made at the close of all the evidence. State v. Leonard, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 223</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 631, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 960, 101 S. Ct. 372, 66 L. Ed. 2d 227 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant introduced evidence at trial on his own behalf, he waived his right to complain on appeal of the denial of his initial motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the State's evidence. Accordingly, only the sufficiency of the evidence at the close of all of the evidence was before the court on appeal. State v. McElrath, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 1</cite>, 366 S.E.2d 442 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, a defendant who introduces evidence waives any motion for dismissal or nonsuit made prior to the introduction of his evidence and cannot urge the prior motion as ground for appeal. State v. Degree, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 302</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 679 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver Not Affected by G.S. 15A-1227(d) or G.S. 15A-1446(d)(5).
   
   - Under this section, a defendant, by presenting evidence, has waived his right to assert the denial of his motion to dismiss at the close of the State's evidence as a ground for appeal. The provisions of G.S. 15A-1227(d) and 15A-1446(d)(5), allowing review on appeal of the sufficiency of the State's evidence in a criminal case without regard to whether the appropriate motion has been made, do not change this rule.

      <p>
       Right to Introduce Evidence Supporting Death Penalty.
   
   - The State is entitled to ask the jury not only to find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, but also to impose the death penalty, and it follows, necessarily, that it may introduce evidence, otherwise competent, to support such a verdict. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Discretion of Judge in Controlling Argument.
   
   - The argument of counsel must be left largely to the control and discretion of the presiding judge. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecuting Attorney Need Not Be Neutral.
   
   - In the discharge of his duties the prosecuting attorney is not required to be, and should not be, neutral. He is not the judge, but the advocate of the State's interest in the matter at hand. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel must be allowed wide latitude in arguing hotly contested cases.
   
   State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Scope of Proper Argument.
   
   - The prosecuting attorney may not, by argument, insinuating questions, or other means, place before the jury incompetent and prejudicial matters not legally admissible in evidence, and may not travel outside of the record or inject into his argument facts of his own knowledge or other facts not included in the evidence. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Argument Proper.
   
   - Where the prosecuting attorney, while making a vigorous plea for the imposition of the death penalty, did not depart from or distort the record, and there was nothing in his argument which would tend to mislead the jury or deprive the defendant of a fair trial, the argument was proper. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Argument Improper.
   
   - Where the prosecuting attorney, in his argument, traveled outside the record, used language offensive in its nature, and, in support of his plea for the death penalty, injected into his argument his own account of his record as a solicitor (now district attorney) in other cases for the purpose of persuading the jury that he did not ask the death penalty where it was not deserved, the argument was improper. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecuting attorney may use appropriate epithets
   
   which are warranted by the evidence. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       And he may vigorously urge jury to convict and to impose the death penalty
   
   in the light of the evidence. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The grand jury, an agency of the State, after investigation according to law, indicted the defendant for murder in the first degree, and the solicitor (now district attorney), an officer of the State, after investigation, determined, on behalf of the State, that the defendant should be tried for this offense and that the death penalty should be sought. These determinations having been made on behalf of the State, it was the right and duty of the prosecuting attorney, vigorously but fairly and in accordance with law, both in the presentation of evidence and in his argument, to seek that result. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Characterization of Defendant in Uncomplimentary Terms.
   
   - When the prosecuting attorney does not go outside of the record and his characterizations of the defendant are supported by evidence, the defendant is not entitled to a new trial by reason of being characterized in uncomplimentary terms in the argument. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's Brutality May Be Argued in Murder Prosecution.
   
   - In a first-degree murder prosecution, it was permissible for the solicitor (now district attorney) to argue that in view of the brutality of defendant's conduct in the killing of his victim, the jury should find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree without any recommendation that punishment be life imprisonment. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 703</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 503, death sentence rev'd, 403 U.S. 948, 91 S. Ct. 2290, 29 L. Ed. 2d 860 (1970), overruled on other grounds, State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 597</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 360 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's Conduct in Connection with Killing.
   
   - A judgment imposing the death penalty was affirmed, although the solicitor (now district attorney), reviewed the evidence and argued with great zeal and fervor that in the light of the defendant's conduct in connection with the killing of the victim, the punishment therefor should be death and the jury should bring a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree without a recommendation that the punishment should be life imprisonment. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Review on Appeal.
   
   - The Supreme Court must determine whether the solicitor (now district attorney) violated the right of the defendant to a fair trial by the nature of his argument to the jury, from the record, irrespective of its view as to the policy of the State with regard to the punishment of the offense in question and without regard to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict and sentence. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Defendant Entitled to New Trial.
   
   - If the prosecuting attorney passed over the boundary of his right and duty in his argument to the jury by his vigorous denunciation of the defendant and thereby denied him a fair trial, the defendant is entitled to a new trial. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).

       Construction.
   
   - Superior court erred in dismissing inmates' declaratory judgment claims because a genuine controversy existed as to the proper construction of G.S. 15-188; however, the superior court properly concluded that the inmates' rights under G.S. 15-188 were limited to the obligation that their deaths be by lethal injection, in a permanent death chamber, and carried out pursuant to an execution protocol approved by the Governor and the Council and that no factual or legal authority supported the inmates' claims of a due process right to participate in the lethal injection protocol approval process.

       Standing.
   
   - North Carolina Department of Correction, its secretary, and a warden had standing to file an action against the North Caroline Medial Board to prohibit it from disciplining physicians for participating in an execution and to obtain a declaratory judgment delineating the parties' rights with regards to executions because they could not carry out their statutory duty to execute condemned inmates under the Execution Protocol without subjecting a physician to discipline by the Medical Board; there was a genuine controversy between the parties arising out of conflicting contentions as to their respective legal rights and liabilities under G.S. 15-190.

      <p>
       North Carolina Council Of State.
   
   - Mandate set forth explicitly in G.S. 15-188, coupled with guidance from the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act and the administrative rules of the North Carolina Council of State is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that adequate guiding standards be put in place to govern the Council's actions. Conner v. N.C. Council of State, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 242</cite>, 716 S.E.2d 836 (2011).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Process of Approval or Disapproval of Execution Protocol Not Subject to the Administrative Procedure Act.
   
   - Superior court did not err in dismissing inmates' request for judicial review of the final decision of respondent North Carolina Council of State, which approved the lethal injection protocol the Department of Correction (DOC) submitted, because the process by which the Council approved or disapproved the DOC's lethal injection protocol was not subject to the APA, and the inmates could not challenge it by going through the Office of Administrative Hearings through the APA; instead, any issue the inmates had with the protocol rested with the General Court of Justice or the federal courts. Conner v. N.C. Council of State, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 242</cite>, 716 S.E.2d 836 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       General Assembly intended that the Department of Correction (DOC) have primary responsibility for the lethal injection process because G.S. 15-188 does not give the North Carolina Council of State authority beyond merely approving or disapproving the submitted protocol; the General Assembly did not intend to negate the express exemption that it provided to the DOC in the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by including a requirement that the Council approve the lethal injection protocol, and thus, the process by which the Council approves or disapproves the DOC's lethal injection protocol is not subject to the APA. Conner v. N.C. Council of State, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 242</cite>, 716 S.E.2d 836 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court lacked authority to consider the death-row inmates' appeal because the sole issue was whether a new execution procedure manual had to be issued in accordance with the rule-making procedures of the Administrative Procedures Act, the matter had not been presented to the trial court for a determination, and the inmates' arguments stemmed entirely from the 2013 statutory changes and the execution protocol made during pendency of the appeal. Robinson v. Shanahan, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 755 S.E.2d 398 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Method of Execution
   
   - Stay of execution was lifted where the word "only" in the relevant statute limited the method of execution to lethal injection but did not limit the drugs or chemicals to an ultrashort-acting barbiturate combined with a chemical paralytic agent. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 454</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 502 (2003).

       Physician Participation in Executions.
   
   - Trial court did not err in ruling in favor of the North Carolina Department of Correction, its secretary, and a warden in their action seeking injunctive relief prohibiting the North Carolina Medical Board from disciplining physicians for participating in an execution because G.S. 15-190 envisioned physician participation in executions in some professional capacity, and the language of the Execution Protocol did not overstep the statutory authority of the Governor and Council of State to determine and approve the exact means of execution, and exceptional care was taken when drafting the Protocol to ensure that it would not cause a physician to violate the Hippocratic Oath; the Protocol's requirement that a physician help prevent "undue pain or suffering" was consistent with the physician's oath to "do no harm," the warden was well within his authority to require such monitoring, and the North Carolina Medical Board was without power to prevent the Warden from doing so.

     <p>
      Upon the sentence of death being pronounced against any person in the State of North Carolina convicted of a crime punishable by death, it shall be the duty of the judge pronouncing such death sentence to make the same in writing, which shall be filed in the papers in the case against such convicted person. The clerk of the superior court in which such death sentence is pronounced shall prepare a certified copy of said judgment or sentence of death, including therewith a copy of any notice or entries of appeal made in such case; if no entries or notice of appeal have been made or given in such case, a statement to the effect shall be included in the certificate of the clerk; it shall also be the duty of the district attorney, assistant district attorney, or attorney prosecuting in behalf of the State in the absence of the district attorney, to prepare and sign a certificate stating in substance that he prosecuted said case in behalf of the State and that notice or entries of appeal have or have not been made or given in said case, and further that he has examined a copy of said judgment or sentence of death certified by the clerk, including the copy of the notice or entries of appeal or statement to the effect that no appeal has been given, and to the best of his knowledge the same is correct; the certificate of said district attorney, or other prosecuting officer above named, shall be attached to the certified copy of said sentence of death, as prepared and certified by the clerk, and both certificates shall be transmitted by the clerk of the superior court in which said sentence of death is pronounced to the warden of the State penitentiary at Raleigh, North Carolina; at the same time and in the same manner, a duplicate original of said certificates shall be prepared by the clerk of the superior court and the district attorney, or other prosecuting officer above named, and the said duplicate original or said certificates shall be transmitted to the Attorney General of North Carolina. If notice of appeal is given or entries of appeal are made after the expiration of the term of superior court in which said sentence of death is pronounced, said certificates shall be prepared by the clerk of the superior court in which said sentence is pronounced and by the district attorney, or other prosecuting officer above named, prosecuting in behalf of the State, in the same manner and shall be transmitted as soon as possible to the warden of the State penitentiary at Raleigh, North Carolina, and to the Attorney General of North Carolina. The above certificates so prepared by the clerk of the superior court in which such sentence of death is pronounced and by the district attorney, or other prosecuting officer above named, shall be transmitted by the clerk of the superior court in which such sentence is pronounced to the warden of the State penitentiary at Raleigh, North Carolina, and to the Attorney General of North Carolina, not more than 20 or less than 10 days before the time fixed in the judgment of the court for the execution of the sentence; and in all cases where there is no appeal, said sentence of death shall not be carried out by the warden of the State penitentiary or by any of his deputies or agents until said certificates so prepared and transmitted by the clerk of the superior court in which said sentence of death is pronounced, and by the district attorney, or the prosecuting officer above named, have been received in the office of the warden of the State penitentiary at Raleigh, North Carolina. In all cases where there is no appeal from the sentence of death and in all cases where the sentence is pronounced against a prisoner convicted of the crime of rape it shall be the duty of the sheriff, together with at least one deputy, to convey to the penitentiary, at Raleigh, North Carolina, such condemned felon or convict forthwith upon the adjournment of the court in which the felon was tried, and deliver the convict or felon to the warden of the penitentiary.

      <p>
       No Distinction Between Conviction by Plea and by Verdict.
   
   - Since an accused may be convicted by his plea as well as by a verdict, there is no reason to read into this section a legislative attempt to distinguish between conviction by plea and by verdict. State v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 17</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 800, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1000, 94 S. Ct. 353, 38 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment Must Be Written and Signed by Trial Judge.
   
   - The entry of judgment of the court on the verdict of guilty of a capital felony by the clerk of the court on its minutes and signed by the judge is not a sufficient compliance with the provisions of this section, its mandatory provisions requiring the judgment to be written and signed by the judge, and where it appears of record that he has failed so to do the case will be remanded. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 321</cite>, 154 S.E. 402 (1930).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Refer to Trial or Crime in Judgment.
   
   - A judgment, while somewhat informal, because it made no reference to the trial or the crime of which the prisoner was convicted, is, nevertheless, sufficient to meet the requirements of this section. State v. Edney, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 706</cite>, 164 S.E. 23 (1932).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Death Sentence Without Reference to Crime.
   
   - A judgment sentencing defendant to death for the commission of a capital felony, though making no reference to the trial or the crime of which the defendant was convicted, while not commenced is held sufficient. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 738</cite>, 140 S.E. 728 (1927).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment Must Show Degree of Murder.
   
   - Where the judgment upon a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree states that the defendant had been convicted of murder, the cause must be remanded in order that it appear on the face of the judgment that the conviction was for murder in the first degree, since the judgment alone is certified to the warden of the State penitentiary. State v. Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 100</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 614 (1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where in a prosecution for murder the jury returns a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, the judgment of the court, which alone is certified to the warden of the State prison, under this section and G.S. 15-188, 15-190, must recite that the defendant had been convicted of murder in the first degree, and where it recites that the prisoner had been convicted of murder, and sentences the prisoner to death, the case will be remanded. State v. Langley, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 687</cite>, 169 S.E. 705 (1933).

       Standing.
   
   - North Carolina Department of Correction, its secretary, and a warden had standing to file an action against the North Caroline Medial Board to prohibit it from disciplining physicians for participating in an execution and to obtain a declaratory judgment delineating the parties' rights with regards to executions because they could not carry out their statutory duty to execute condemned inmates under the Execution Protocol without subjecting a physician to discipline by the Medical Board; there was a genuine controversy between the parties arising out of conflicting contentions as to their respective legal rights and liabilities under G.S. 15-190.

       Physician Participation in Executions.
   
   - North Carolina Medial Board's position statement, which prohibited physicians from participating in executions, exceeded the Board's authority under N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 90 because the statement directly contravened the specific requirement of physician presence found in G.S 15-190; G.S. 15-190, by its plain language, envisions physician participation in executions in some professional capacity, and while the Medical Board would retain disciplinary power over a licensed medical doctor who participates in an execution pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a01s90-14" target="_blank">G.S. 90-14</a></cite>, it may not discipline or threaten discipline against its licensees solely for participating in the execution alone.

      </p>
      <p>
       To deny petitioner 64-day credit against his original sentence, after subjecting petitioner to the loss of his liberty by incarceration in a foreign state, would amount to punishment twice for the same offense and a deprivation of his liberty without due process of law, both in violation of U.S. Const., Amend. V, as made applicable to the states via U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Childers v. Laws, 558 F. Supp. 1284 (W.D.N.C. 1983).

      <p>
       Statute is Unambiguous as to Requirements for Credit.
   
   - Language of G.S. 15-196.1 is clear and unambiguous that four requirements must be met before a credit is required. State v. Corkum, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 129, 735 S.E.2d 420 (2012).

        By its express terms, this statute includes only time spent in custody in "State" institutions
       </b>
       and requires a credit against only custody under a charge already "commenced." "State" is defined at subdivision (8) of G.S. 15A-101 as "The State of North Carolina" and does not include other states. Childers v. Laws, 558 F. Supp. 1284 (W.D.N.C. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Detention in a foreign city jail at the request of North Carolina amounts to just as much deprivation of liberty and punishment as incarceration in any municipal jail in North Carolina. Childers v. Laws, 558 F. Supp. 1284 (W.D.N.C. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where petitioner was arrested and confined in a Virginia city jail solely at the request and direction of the State of North Carolina, whose sole justification for having petitioner arrested and jailed was the fact that petitioner had not yet completed a lawfully imposed sentence of imprisonment; refusal of credit against his original sentence for the time he spent in custody, in effect amounts to an increase in petitioner's prison sentence at the whim of state prison authorities. Clearly, such an increase in petitioner's sentence amounts to a violation of his right under U.S. Const., Amend. V to be free from being punished for the same offense twice. Childers v. Laws, 558 F. Supp. 1284 (W.D.N.C. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Potter's House, which was an independent Christian faith-based rehabilitation program and not affiliated with or operated by either a State of North Carolina or local government agency, did not qualify as a "State or local correctional, mental or other institution" under G.S. 15-196.1. Accordingly, the trial court properly declined to give defendant credit against defendant active sentence for the days defendant spent at Potter's House. State v. Stephenson, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 621, 713 S.E.2d 170 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       G.S. 15-196.1 did not entitle defendant to credit for time in federal custody on a related charge because (1) defendant was not confined in a "state or local" institution, and (2) defendant's confinement was not a result of the charge for which defendant was sentenced. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 752 S.E.2d 216 (2013), review denied, 755 S.E.2d 617, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 206 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court had no discretion, under the Structured Sentencing Act, G.S. 15A-1340.13(b), to give defendant credit for time spent in federal custody on a related charge because (1) G.S. 15-196.1 was an exception to minimum prison terms, and (2) no statute specifically authorized such credit. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 752 S.E.2d 216 (2013), review denied, 755 S.E.2d 617, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 206 (2014).

       "Custody."
   
   - Defendant participating in a residential treatment program where his freedom was substantially limited was in "custody," for purposes of entitlement to a sentencing credit for time spent in the program. State v. Hearst, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 132</cite>, 567 S.E.2d 124 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Language of G.S. 15-196.1 demonstrates the legislature's intention that a defendant be credited with all time defendant was in custody and not at liberty as the result of a charge. State v. Hearst, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 132</cite>, 567 S.E.2d 124 (2002).

       <b>
        Life Sentence Not Reduced by Credits.
       </b>
       - Because a life sentence lasts for the prisoner's natural life, no reduction in sentence by credits of any kind is possible. Wilson v. North Carolina, 438 F.2d 284 (4th Cir. 1971), decided under former G.S. 15-184 before the enactment of this Article.

        Credit for Time Awaiting Affirmance of Appeal.
       </b>
       - Denial of credit to a prisoner for the time he spent in jail from the date of his first conviction until the affirmance of his second appeal is multiple punishment. Such time must be fully credited insofar as possible as punishment already exacted. Although it cannot be credited against his life sentence, which by its very nature is indefinite, it can be credited toward the 10 years he must wait to be considered for parole. Wilson v. North Carolina, 438 F.2d 284 (4th Cir. 1971), decided under former G.S. 15-184 before the enactment of this Article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Credit for Time Awaiting Revocation Hearing for Violation of Post-Release Supervision.
   
   - Under G.S. 15-196.1, the trial court was required to credit defendant with the eight days he spent in custody awaiting a revocation hearing for his first violation of post-release supervision. The fact that the remainder of a defendant's sentence was not activated as a result of the first violation of post-release supervision does not bar a credit from later being applied after post-release supervision is revoked following a second violation where the time spent in prison resulted from the same original conviction that culminated in the sentence. State v. Corkum, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 129, 735 S.E.2d 420 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Treatment Program Constituted Custody in State Institution.
   
   - Participation in alternative treatment program constituted commitment or confinement in a State institution such that a defendant was entitled to credit under G.S. 15-196.1 for time spent participating therein. State v. Hearst, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 132</cite>, 567 S.E.2d 124 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for credit against his sentence for time he spent in a substance abuse program as defendant was confined and in custody pursuant to the plain meaning of G.S. 15-196.1 since defendant's freedom and liberty were limited by the programs and daily schedule and, although he could leave or withdraw from the program at any time, he was told that if he did so, he would be charged with additional crimes and have his suspended sentence activated. State v. Lutz, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 628 S.E.2d 34 (2006).
   <br />
      </p>

       Time spent on parole is not to be credited on an active sentence.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       But a defendant who has served, pursuant to special probation,
   
   an active sentence is entitled to credit for that time on any sentence imposed upon revocation of probation. State v. Farris, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 431 S.E.2d 803, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 552</cite>, 444 S.E.2d 182 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Incarceration for Probation Violation.
   
   - Trial court erred by failing to award defendant credit for her prior confinement for violation of her probation; the state conceded that defendant was entitled to a 30-day credit for the time she spent incarcerated for her violation of probation. State v. Belcher, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 620, 619 S.E.2d 567 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       House arrest
   
   (whether or not accompanied by electronic monitoring) in a defendant's own home while awaiting trial does not constitute confinement in a state or local institution and does not qualify as time that can be credited against a defendant's sentence pursuant to this section. State v. Jarman, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 535 S.E.2d 875 (2000).

      <p>
       <b>
        Withholding of Credit for inability to make bail discriminatory.
       </b>
       - Denial of credit for pretrial custody necessitated by financial inability to make bail is discrimination based on financial status. Steele v. North Carolina, 348 F. Supp. 1023 (W.D.N.C. 1972), aff'd in part, 475 F.2d 1401 (4th Cir. 1973), decided under former G.S. 15-176.2
      </p>
      <p>
       Constitutionality of Revocation of Time Credited Pursuant to This Section.
   
   - The trial court's revocation of defendant's credit for time spent under house arrest prior to her entry of plea did not violate her constitutional right against double jeopardy because the restraints ordered were properly imposed to ensure her presence at the trial and to disable her from committing other offenses. State v. Jarman, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 535 S.E.2d 875 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court committed no error in failing to credit time already credited

   - Because a judge's signing of an order in compliance with this section is mechanical and routine, the trial court's order depriving the defendant of a jail credit for her time in home detention, which she had erroneously received, was the correction of a clerical error and within the court's power although the term of court had expired. State v. Jarman, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 535 S.E.2d 875 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in failing to give a juvenile credit for the time she served in secure custody prior to her dispositional hearing because the provisions of G.S. 15-196.1 were applicable to juvenile commitments. In re D.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 679 S.E.2d 449 (2009), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 214</cite> (2010).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Credit for Time Served Before Disposition in the Juvenile Context.
   
   - Appellate court erred in holding that G.S. 15-196.1 applied to juvenile confinement and that a delinquent juvenile was entitled to credit for time served in secure custody pending the juvenile's dispositional hearings; the General Statutes did not authorize credit for time served before disposition in the juvenile context. In re D.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 214</cite>, 694 S.E.2d 753 (June 17, 2010).

      </p>
      <p>
       Credit Properly Applied in Juvenile Proceedings.
   
   - Where a juvenile was credited for time served in conjunction with the violation of her conditional release, she was not also entitled to receive similar credit toward a new commitment term under a new disposition order. In re Allison, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 547 S.E.2d 169 (2001).

        Detention in a foreign city jail

       at the request of North Carolina amounts to just as much deprivation of liberty and punishment as incarceration in any municipal jail in North Carolina. Childers v. Laws, 558 F. Supp. 1284 (W.D.N.C. 1983).

       Where petitioner was arrested and confined in a Virginia city jail solely at the request and direction of the State of North Carolina, whose sole justification for having petitioner arrested and jailed was the fact that petitioner had not yet completed a lawfully imposed sentence of imprisonment; refusal of credit against his original sentence for the time he spent in custody, in effect amounts to an increase in petitioner's prison sentence at the whim of state prison authorities. Clearly, such an increase in petitioner's sentence amounts to a violation of his right under U.S. Const., Amend. V to be free from being punished for the same offense twice. Childers v. Laws, 558 F. Supp. 1284 (W.D.N.C. 1983).

       Reduction of Original Sentence Not A Credit.
   
   - The fact that a judge reduced defendant's original seven year sentence to six years and nine months, a total reduction of 90 days, did not satisfy the requirement that the defendant be given a 90-day credit.
   A credit reduces the time required to attain privileges which are dependent upon the passage of a specific length of time in custody, and a reduction in the sentence term did not accomplish that purpose.

       Appellate review.
   
   - Defendant's request for additional sentencing credit was not properly before the appellate court because the issue of additional sentencing credit was a matter for administrative action, as provided by G.S. 15-196.4, rather than a subject for appeal; the proper procedure to obtain additional credit was for defendant to initially have presented her claim to the trial court. State v. Cloer, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 716, 678 S.E.2d 399 (2009).

      <p>
       Certiorari was denied and defendant's appeal was dismissed without prejudice where he acknowledged that the record was insufficient to resolve whether he was entitled to more jail credit than the trial court awarded, and the appropriate procedure under judicial precedent was to first seek relief in the trial court under G.S. 15-196.4.
