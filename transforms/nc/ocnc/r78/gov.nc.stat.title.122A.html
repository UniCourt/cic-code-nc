    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    The General Assembly hereby finds and declares that as a result of the spread of slum conditions and blight to formerly sound urban and rural neighborhoods and as a result of actions involving highways, public facilities and urban renewal activities there exists in the State of North Carolina a serious shortage of decent, safe and sanitary residential housing available at low prices or rentals to persons and families of lower income. This shortage is severe in certain urban areas of the State, is especially critical in the rural areas, and is inimical to the health, safety, welfare and prosperity of all residents of the State and to the sound growth of North Carolina communities.
   </p>
   <p>
    The General Assembly hereby finds and declares further that private enterprise and investment have not been able to produce, without assistance, the needed construction of decent, safe and sanitary residential housing at low prices or rentals which persons and families of lower income can afford, or to achieve the urgently needed rehabilitation of much of the present lower income housing. It is imperative that the supply of residential housing for persons and families of lower income affected by the spread of slum conditions and blight and for persons and families of lower income displaced by public actions or natural disaster be increased; and that private enterprise and investment be encouraged to sponsor, build and rehabilitate residential housing for such persons and families, to help prevent the recurrence of slum conditions and blight and assist in their permanent elimination throughout North Carolina.
   </p>
   <p>
    The General Assembly hereby finds and declares further that the purposes of this Chapter are to provide financing for residential housing construction, new or rehabilitated, for sale or rental to persons and families of lower income.
   </p>
   <p>
    The General Assembly hereby finds and declares further that in accomplishing this purpose, the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, a public agency and an instrumentality of the State, is acting in all respects for the benefit of the people of the State in the performance of essential public functions and serves a public purpose in improving and otherwise promoting their health, welfare and prosperity, and that the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, is empowered to act on behalf of the State of North Carolina and its people in serving this public purpose for the benefit of the general public.
   </p>
   <p>
    The General Assembly hereby further finds and declares that it shall be the policy of said Agency, whenever feasible, to give first priority in its programs to assisting persons and families of lower income in the purchase and rehabilitation of residential housing, and to undertake its programs in the areas where the greatest housing need exists, and to give priority to projects and individual units which conform to sound principles and practices of comprehensive land use and environmental planning, regional development planning and transportation planning as established by units of local government and regional organizations having jurisdiction over the area within which such projects and units are to be located if such government agencies exist in an area under consideration. However, no area of need shall be penalized because government planning agencies do not exist in such areas.
   </p>
   <p>
    The General Assembly hereby also further finds and declares that private enterprise and investment have not been able to provide, without assistance, the needed installation of energy saving materials in owner occupied residences of persons and families of lower income. It is imperative for the health, safety and welfare of these persons and the general public that their residences be suitably heated at affordable cost in order to provide decent housing; and that the consumption of nonrenewable sources of energy be reduced. Therefore, the General Assembly finds that one of the purposes of this Chapter is to assist persons and families of lower income to obtain loans for the purpose of heating their homes at affordable cost and at the same time to significantly reduce the amount of consumption of nonrenewable sources of energy.

   </h4>
   <p>
    Agency Is Not a Legislative Body.
   
   - The North Carolina Housing Corporation (now the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency) does not legislate but determines factually, by application of the factors the General Assembly has prescribed, what persons or families are persons and families of lower income and therefore entitled to the benefits of this Chapter. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Nor Is It Vested with Power of Eminent Domain.
   
   - The North Carolina Housing Corporation (now the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency) is not vested with the power of eminent domain. Rather, its function is to foster the planning, construction and financing of modest residences which would not otherwise be available to persons and families of lower income. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Public Purpose of Chapter.
   
   - This Chapter was enacted for a public purpose and the North Carolina Housing Corporation's (now the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency's) authorized activities pursuant thereto are for a public purpose. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Scope of Activities.
   
   - The North Carolina Housing Corporation's (now the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency's) authorized activities respond to a serious need of deep public concern but do so only when the planning, construction and financing of residential housing is not otherwise available to persons and families of lower income. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Function.
   
   - The evident function of the North Carolina Housing Corporation (now the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency) created by this Chapter is to assist persons and families of lower income who desire and seek residential housing elsewhere than as tenants in a low-cost housing project. Such persons would include those who were or are ineligible to be tenants in a housing project. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    The reason and justification for the Corporation's (now Agency's) existence
   
   is to make available decent, safe and sanitary housing to persons and families of lower income who cannot otherwise obtain such housing accommodations. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Discretion in Choice of Sites and Sponsor, Builder or Developer.
   
   - The North Carolina Housing Corporation (now the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency) must exercise its discretion and judgment with reference to the choice of sites and the identity of the sponsor, builder or developer with whom the Corporation (now Agency) will deal in connection with a particular project. It is contemplated that such sponsor, builder or developer will continue until completion of the program. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).

The Agency shall not purchase nor make commitment to purchase mortgage loans, federally insured securities or other obligations from a mortgage lender from which it has previously purchased federally insured securities or mortgage loans initially made without such prior approval unless said mortgage lender has either made or entered into written commitments to make such new mortgage loans.

In determining the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Agency shall take into consideration (1) occupancy rates of the project, (2) market conditions affecting the project, (3) costs of operation of the project, (4) debt service for the project, (5) management of the project and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

     The Board of Directors of the Agency may determine, by resolution, to permit not in excess of ten percent (10%) of the rental units in any distressed rental housing project to be rented to persons or families without regard to income until the project's occupancy levels, in the judgment of the Agency, will sustain operations at a level sufficient to prevent delinquency or default.

The bonds or notes of each issue shall be dated and may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the Agency at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Agency. Any such bonds or notes shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the Local Government Commission of North Carolina with the approval of the Agency.

       The repurchase agreement is entered into with an institution whose ability to pay its unsecured long-term obligations (including, if the institution is an insurance company, its claims paying ability) is rated in one of the two highest ratings categories by a nationally recognized securities rating agency. If the term of the repurchase agreement is for a period of one year or less, however, the repurchase agreement may be entered into with an institution that does not have such a long-term rating if its ability to pay its unsecured short-term obligations is rated in one of the two highest ratings categories by a nationally recognized securities rating agency. If the institution with which the agreement is to be entered does not meet the ratings requirement of this subparagraph, the repurchase agreement may nevertheless be entered into with the institution if the obligations of the institution under the repurchase agreement are fully guaranteed by another institution that does meet the ratings requirement of this subparagraph.

The repurchase agreement does not have to be terminated, however, if a new guarantor meeting the rating requirement set forth in subparagraph a. as the requirement necessary for the Agency to enter the repurchase agreement agrees to fully guarantee the obligations of the institution under the repurchase agreement.

The repurchase agreement must provide that the value of the underlying obligations shall be maintained at a current market value, calculated at least daily, of not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the repurchase price.
