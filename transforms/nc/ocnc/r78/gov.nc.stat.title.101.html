        <p>
            Common Law. - General laws regulating the change of a person's name, and prescribing a procedure therefor, do not abrogate the common-law rule which allows a person to change his name without resort to legal procedure or repeal it by implication or otherwise.
            They merely affirm and are in aid of the common-law rule and provide an additional method of effecting a change of name and, more importantly, provide a method for recording the change. In re Mohlman, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite>            220, 216 S.E.2d 147 (1975).
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the common-law standard, a showing of fraud or misrepresentation akin to fraud is necessary to deny a change of name. In re Mohlman, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 216 S.E.2d 147 (1975).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            To provide a procedure whereby one can secure a change of name through legal procedure with a provision for proper recordation thereof among the public records is desirable and far less objectionable than the common-law provision. In re Mohlman,
            <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 216 S.E.2d 147 (1975).
            <br />

        <p>
            Married Women. - Nothing in the law states that by marriage a woman gives up her right as a person to change her name as anyone else might change his or hers. In re Mohlman, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 216 S.E.2d 147 (1975).

            the child. If the parent denies that the parent abandoned the child, this issue of fact shall be transferred and determined as provided in G.S. 1-301.2. If abandonment is determined, the consent of the parent is not required. Upon final determination
            of this issue of fact the proceeding shall be transferred back to the special proceedings docket for further action by the clerk. A parent who files an application on behalf of a minor pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection shall submit
            proof of the other parent's conviction to the clerk at the time of filing.

            Determination of Abandonment by Clerk of Superior Court. - In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction has not previously declared child to be an abandoned child, the clerk of the superior court is authorized to determine whether an abandonment
            has taken place. In re Dunston, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 197 S.E.2d 560 (1973).

            This section contemplates only the situation where one natural or adoptive parent petitions for the change of name of a child, and the other parent stands to lose his name with respect to that child.

        </p>
        <p>
            Neither the consent of a child's stepfather, nor a finding that the stepfather has abandoned the child is necessary in a petition by the natural mother of that child to have the child's name changed. In re Dunston, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite>            647, 197 S.E.2d 560 (1973).

            Nor to Natural Father of Child Born Out of Wedlock. - This section was not designed to require the consent of the natural father to a name change where the child was born out of wedlock. In re Dunston, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite>            647, 197 S.E.2d 560 (1973).

            Unless His Name Appears on Birth Certificate After Both Parents Execute Affidavit of Paternity. - Where unmarried parents executed an Affidavit of Paternity and entered respondent's name on the birth certificate as the father, court held that there was
            no authority, statutory or decisional, permitting petitioner to unilaterally change the name of her son, born out of wedlock and not yet legitimated, absent the father's consent.
