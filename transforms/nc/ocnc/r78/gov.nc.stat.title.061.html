    This section applies only to religious societies
   
   and not to educational institutions. Allen v. Baskerville, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 126</cite>, 31 S.E. 383 (1898); Thornton v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 498</cite>, 53 S.E. 341 (1906).

   <p>
    This section recognizes that religious bodies must act through and appoint trustees.
   
   Pressly v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 732</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 920 (1953).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Society Entitled to Remove Trustee Who Is Faithless to Trust.
   
   - Under the provisions of this section, a religious society may remove a trustee of church property who proves faithless to his trust and may fill any vacancy thus created. Nash v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 231</cite>, 23 S.E. 178 (1895).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Individual Liability Erroneously Assessed
   
   - When church officials sued seceders from the church to recover church property, the trial court erroneously found the seceders individually liable because, under G.S. 61-1(b), they were immune from individual liability, as they were acting on behalf of a religious society. Daniel v. Wray, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 161, 580 S.E.2d 711 (2003).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Faithlessness is not required, however, and a religious society may remove trustees at will.
   
   North Carolina Christian Conference v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 524</cite>, 72 S.E. 617 (1911).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Effect of Church Regulations.
   
   - A church has authority to appoint a "suitable number" of its own trustees for the purpose of acquiring and holding church property, and remove them at will; furthermore, where the discipline of the denomination with which a church is affiliated has provided a note to be given for the trial of "offenses," this regulation refers to infractions of church discipline and does not apply to the election or removal of trustees. North Carolina Christian Conference v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 524</cite>, 72 S.E. 617 (1911).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Right of Competent Trustee to Maintain Action for Removal of Trustees, etc.
   
   - A duly appointed trustee of a religious society may maintain an action for the removal of faithless or incompetent trustees, and compel them to convey the property held by them to the purposes for which it was designed, and such trustee may also maintain an action to set up a lost deed executed for the benefit of the cestui que trust. Nash v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 550</cite>, 14 S.E. 77 (1891).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Right of Member to Sue.
   
   - In the absence of a competent trustee and a governing body authorized to appoint trustees, any member of a religious society has such a beneficial interest as will enable him, in behalf of fellow members, to maintain such action as may be necessary to protect their common interest. Nash v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 550</cite>, 14 S.E. 77 (1891).

   <p>
    The trustees and their successors have power to receive donations, and to purchase, take and hold property, real and personal, in trust for such church or denomination, religious society or congregation; and they may sue or be sued in all proper actions, for or on account of the donations and property so held or claimed by them, and for and on account of any matters relating thereto. They shall be accountable to the churches, denominations, societies and congregations for the use and management of such property, and shall surrender it to any person authorized to demand it.

    This section applies only to property held for religious purposes.

   <p>
    No General Capacity of Acquisition.
   
   - Religious societies or their trustees have no general capacity of acquisition; they can only take for the use of the society. And by a conveyance to trustees, for purposes forbidden by the policy of the law, nothing passes. Trustees of Quaker Soc'y of Contentnea v. Dickenson, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. 189</cite> (1827).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Right of Church to Use Property.
   
   - A church of the congregational system, having elected certain trustees to supercede several trustees theretofore elected, holds the church property through those trustees later elected and has the right to the use of the church for religious services without molestation from the trustees who were removed or from its conference. North Carolina Christian Conference v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 524</cite>, 72 S.E. 617 (1911).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    A church is not required to be incorporated to be able to hold property;
   
   therefore, revocation of the corporate charter of the United Church of God was irrelevant to determining whether the United Church of God, Inc. had the right to control the property of its alleged local affiliate, St. Luke United Church of God of America. United Church of God, Inc. v. McLendon, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 344 S.E.2d 373 (1986).

    A communion service of a church is not liable to seizure and sale under an execution by a pastor

    An individual member of a religious society has an equitable interest in the property
   
   held by the society. Nash v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 231</cite>, 23 S.E. 178 (1895).
   <br />

   <p>
    <b>
     Trusts for Special Purposes.
    </b>
    - There is nothing in this section which precludes trustees of a certain North Carolina church from accepting trusts for special purposes; and, even if there were, a trust for a special purpose would not fail because they were named as trustees, but equity would appoint other trustees to administer it in application of the maxim that a trust will not be allowed to fail for lack of a trustee. King v. Richardson, 46 F. Supp. 510 (M.D.N.C. 1942), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 136 F.2d 849 (4th Cir. 1943).
   </p>
   <p>
    The trustees of a church are merely agents and have no property interest
   
   as against the governing body of the church. North Carolina Christian Conference v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 524</cite>, 72 S.E. 617 (1911).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Congregation taking possession of a church cannot contest validity of a mortgage given by the trustees
   
   for the purchase money on the ground that it was ultra vires. Rountree v. Blount, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 25</cite>, 39 S.E. 631 (1901).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Right of Trustees to Enforce Bequest.
   
   - Where a testator provided for building a fence around a certain chapel cemetery, the trustees of the chapel were the proper parties to require the executor to perform this provision. Cabe v. Vanhook, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 424</cite>, 37 S.E. 464 (1900).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Recovery of Property by Trustees.
   
   - The title to church property is vested in the trustees individually and they may recover at law, though in the writ and declaration they style themselves "trustees." Walker v. Fawcett, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. 44</cite> (1846).
   </p>
   <p>
    Trustees of a church allegedly merged into a successor had standing to bring a quiet title suit against the successor because the trustees' assertion of property rights on behalf of a non-incorporated religious organization only depended on the successor's failure to obtain the consent of all trustees to transfer church property. Burns v. Kingdom Impact Global Ministries, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 797 S.E.2d 21 (2017).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Title Not in Controversy in Contest Between Trustees.
   
   - In a contest between two committees, each claiming to be the rightful board of trustees to hold the same title in trust for the same beneficial owner, the title did not come into controversy. Thornton v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 498</cite>, 53 S.E. 341 (1906).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Right of Original Trustees to Sue Though Not Legally Appointed.
   
   - Where a conveyance was made to three persons for a certain tract of land as trustees for a church, a suit of trespass could be brought by them against the wrongdoers, even though they could not be appointed trustees according to law. Walker v. Fawcett, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. 44</cite> (1846).
   </p>
   <p>
    It is only when a suit is brought by persons who claim as "successors" that a question arises as to whether the original bargainees were duly chosen the trustees of a religious congregation, and whether the persons suing were also duly chosen trustees, so as to give them legally the character of "successors" to the former, and thereby vest in them the title to the property which is necessary to support an action. Walker v. Fawcett, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. 44</cite> (1846).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Trustees Not Entitled to Recover for Physical Suffering of Pastor, His Family or Congregation.
   
   - In a suit by the trustees of a church against a railroad company for the improper use of its terminal or depot at or near the manse of the church, no recovery could be had for any physical suffering upon the part of their pastor, his family, or the individuals composing the congregation. Taylor v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 400</cite>, 59 S.E. 129 (1907).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Liability of Trustees for Material Ordered for Church.
   
   - The trustees of a church would be liable for material ordered by one of their number and used in building the church, even though the order was not authorized. Tull v. Trustees of M.E. Church, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 424</cite> (1876).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    The building committee of a church is not liable for injuries received by a workman.
   
   Wilson v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 364</cite>, 14 S.E. 962 (1892).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Member of Quasi Corporation Is Engaged in Joint Enterprise.
   
   - One of the material differences between a church or denomination, religious society or congregation (a quasi corporation) in North Carolina and a real corporation organized or existing pursuant to statutory law is that a member of such a quasi corporation is engaged in a joint enterprise and may not recover damages sustained through the tortious conduct of another member thereof from the quasi corporation. Goard v. Branscom, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 189 S.E.2d 667, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 756</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 354 (1972).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    May Not Recover for Negligence of Agent, Employee or Another Member.
   
   - This section does not authorize a member of a church or denomination, religious society or congregation (a quasi corporation) to recover of the quasi corporation for the negligence of an agent, employee or another member thereof. Goard v. Branscom, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 189 S.E.2d 667, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 756</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 354 (1972).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Joinder of Church as Defendant Not Required in Derivative Action Against Pastor and Other Church Officers.
   
   - Trial court erred in dismissing the complaint brought by a group of church members against the pastor and various church officers due to the church members' failure to have named the church as a defendant, because the cause of action, which alleged civil conversion, various conspiracy charges, breach of the church's constitution and by-laws as well as breach of fiduciary duty, was really a derivative action in that the church members alleged that the church was unincorporated and, therefore, the church members were really suing on behalf of the church; the dispute arose from alleged missing church funds and the allegation that the church officers were permitting the pastor to remain at the church and receive his salary against the majority vote of the congregation. Bridges v. Oates, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 605 S.E.2d 685 (2004).

   - A provision in a will that a church is to be built from certain funds will not fail because there is not a sufficient amount of the funds to build a church as large as directed by the testator. Paine v. Forney, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 237</cite>, 38 S.E. 885 (1901).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Specific Trust Must Be Imperative.
   
   - A specific trust will not be superimposed upon a title conveyed to a religious congregation, authorizing the courts to interfere and control the management and disposition of the property, unless this is the clear intent of the grantor expressed in language which should be construed as imperative. Hayes v. Franklin, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 599</cite>, 54 S.E. 432 (1906).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    No Trust Created.
   
   - The recital in a deed conveying land to the vestry and wardens of a church that it was made "for the purpose of aiding in the establishment of a Home for Indigent Widows or Orphans, or in the promotion of any other charitable or religious objects to which the property may be appropriated" created no trust, and the grantee could convey a perfect title. St. James v. Bagley, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 384</cite>, 50 S.E. 841 (1905).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Trustees' Standing to Bring Quiet Title Suit.
   
   - Trustees of a church allegedly merged into a successor had standing to bring a quiet title suit against the successor because the trustees' assertion of property rights on behalf of a non-incorporated religious organization only depended on the successor's failure to obtain the consent of all trustees to transfer church property. Burns v. Kingdom Impact Global Ministries, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 797 S.E.2d 21 (2017).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Trustees May Hold Property as Against Majority of Members.
   
   - Where land is conveyed to the officers and trustees of the nondenominational religious organization for the purposes of the organization, its officers and trustees have title to the property in trust and are entitled to hold it for the use and occupancy of the organization as against members of the organization, even though they are in the large majority, who seek possession of the property for use and occupancy by a denominational church. Wheeless v. Barrett, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 282</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 629 (1948).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Rights of Majority of Congregation Withdrawing from Denomination.
   
   - A conveyance of land to trustees for the erection of a church to belong to a denomination gave the title in trust for the use of the denomination; therefore, members of the congregation of the church so erected who withdrew affiliation from the denomination, even though they were a majority of the congregation, were not entitled to the control and use of the property as against the denomination, irrespective of whether the particular church was congregational or connectional. Western N. Carolina Conference v. Tally, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 1</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 467 (1948).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Effect of Denomination's Failure to Act at Time of Violation.
   
   - Court found that local church, which was connectionally related to denomination yet congregational as to property, could keep property because it would be inequitable, if not unconstitutional, for a North Carolina court to enforce the denomination's "Discipline," essentially property rules, against the local church when the denomination made no effort to enforce it at the time of the alleged violations. Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of Ams., Inc. v. McSwain, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 676, 518 S.E.2d 558 (1999).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Where a diocese receiving a devise of land was afterwards divided
   
   into two dioceses, the land became the property of both and not that of the diocese in which the land happened to be and in which the testator resided. Trustees of Diocese of E. Carolina v. Trustees of Diocese of N. Carolina, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 442</cite>, 9 S.E. 310 (1889).

    Sale to Promote Testator's Purpose.
   
   - Where a testator devised lands to the trustees of a certain church, "to be held by them as a rectory or residence for the ministers of said church; that the same shall not be disposed of, sold, or used in any other way or for any other purpose than the one designated," the trustees could sell the property if the purpose declared would be promoted thereby, or the court could order a sale under its general equity power.
