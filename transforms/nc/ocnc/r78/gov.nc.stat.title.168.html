       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 2008-83, s. 2, provides: "The UNC-CH Division TEACCH Autism Program (TEACCH), in consultation with the School of Government and the Autism Society of NC, shall develop a video to raise awareness of autism
                    for those involved in government and public service, including information on recognizing the signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, and contacts for further information on appropriate responses to individuals with autism."

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2009-264, s. 1, provides: "It is the intent of the General Assembly to refer to a person with a disability as a person first when directing the drafting of statutes and resolutions. The Legislative Services Office shall incorporate into its
                    drafting training of legislative drafters the preference to avoid language that implies a person as a whole is disabled, equates a person with his or her condition, or is regarded as derogatory or demeaning. The Arc of North Carolina
                    shall provide a list of nationally recognized descriptors to the Legislative Services Office to be used in this training."

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2009-264, s. 2, provides: "The General Statutes Commission shall recommend to the 2010 reconvened session of the 2009 General Assembly and to the 2011 Regular Session of the General Assembly any statutory changes and drafting policies needed
                    to make the General Statutes and administrative rules refer to a person with a disability as a person first. The goal of such revisions shall be to avoid language that implies a person as a whole is disabled, equates a person with
                    his or her condition, or is regarded as derogatory or demeaning. In making recommendations, the General Statutes Commission shall distinguish those instances where a word or phrase is required by federal law or regulation, is describing
                    a medical diagnosis, or is referring to nonliving entities such as facilities, organizations, programs, services, or zone designations."

                    <p>
                        Legislative Intent. - The legislature intended to grant broad protection of basic rights to all persons with any type of disability, and additionally sought to grant particular protection to an especially disabled group, the "visually handicapped." Burgess
                        v. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 481, 250 S.E.2d 687, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 520</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 248 (1979).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Liberal Construction. - This Chapter is remedial statute, and should be construed broadly rather than narrowly to achieve its purposes. Burgess v. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co., <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 520</cite>, 259 S.E.2d
                        248 (1979).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Disability, in the context of this Chapter, is a present, noncorrectable loss of function which substantially impairs a person's ability to function normally. Pressman v. UNC, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 296, 337
                        S.E.2d 644 (1985).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Application of Term "Visually Handicapped". - The General Assembly did not intend the narrow definition of "visually handicapped" in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.111.html#t111a01s111-11" target="_blank">G.S. 111-11</a></cite>                        to control the meaning of the term "visual disabilities" in this section; rather, the General Assembly intended that the definition in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.111.html#t111a01s111-11" target="_blank">G.S. 111-11</a></cite>                        would apply only when the specific term "visually handicapped" was used. Burgess v. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co., <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 520</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 248 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "visual disability," as used in this section, includes as its most serious gradation the "visually handicapped" as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.111.html#t111a01s111-11" target="_blank">G.S. 111-11</a></cite>,
                        but also includes person with visual impairments less serious than those encompassed by the term "visually handicapped." Burgess v. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 481, 250 S.E.2d 687, rev'd
                        on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 520</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 248 (1979).

                        Person who has eye disease but whose vision is functioning normally with glasses is not visually disabled within the meaning of this section, and thus is not a "handicapped person" who is granted a right of employment by G.S. 168-6. Burgess v. Joseph
                        Schlitz Brewing Co., <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 520</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 248 (1979).

                    <p>
                        People Irritated by Tobacco Smoke. - It is manifestly clear that the legislature did not intend to include within the meaning of "handicapped persons" those people with "any pulmonary problem," however minor, nor all people who are harmed or irritated
                        by tobacco smoke. GASP v. Mecklenburg County, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 225, 256 S.E.2d 477 (1979).

                        suffering from a mental disability. Pressman v. UNC, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 296, 337 S.E.2d 644 (1985).
