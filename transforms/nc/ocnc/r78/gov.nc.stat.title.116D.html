                    Session Laws 2000-3, s. 2(a), as amended by Session Laws 2001-424, s. 31.9, Session Laws 2002-126, s. 9.3, Session Laws 2003-284, s. 9.3, Session Laws 2006-146, ss. 3.1-3.3, Session Laws 2007-394, ss. 8 and 9, and by Session Laws 2008-204, s. 2, directs
                    that the proceeds of university improvement general obligation bonds and notes, including any premium thereon, except the proceeds of university improvement general obligation bonds the issuance of which has been anticipated by bond
                    anticipation notes or the proceeds of refunding bonds or notes, are to be allocated and expended for paying the cost of university capital facilities, to the extent and as provided in Article 2 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.116D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 116D</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes, as enacted by the act and subject to change as provided in the act, and sets out a schedule of allocations for each of the constituent or affiliated institutions.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2000-3, s. 2(b), authorizes the Director of the Budget to use excess funds to meet increased costs of other capital facilities located at the same institution, where the cost of a particular capital facility is less than the amount allocated
                    for it and to do so would be in the best interest of the State and the University, and directs the Director to report to the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations on any such changes. Section 2(b) further authorizes
                    the General Assembly, in its discretion, from time to time, to change any capital facility and the amount of the allocation for it set forth in the act. The provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.116.html#t116a01s116-11" target="_blank">G.S. 116-11(9)</a></cite>                    with respect to appropriations to the Board of Governors of The University of North Carolina do not apply to proceeds of university improvement general obligation bonds and notes issued pursuant to Article 2 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.116D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 116D</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes, as enacted by the act.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2000-3, s. 2(c), provides that allocations to the costs of a capital improvement or undertaking in each case may include allocations to pay the costs set forth in the act in connection with the issuance of university improvement general obligation
                    bonds for that capital improvement or undertaking.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2000-3, s. 2(e), provides that bond proceeds allocated to the reserve for repairs and renovations and cost overruns are to be used only for repairs and renovations for institutions listed in the section and for additional costs needed for
                    projects listed due to cost overruns. The subsection authorizes the Board of Governors, subject to the approval of the Director of Budget, to determine the capital facilities for which bond proceeds in the reserve may be used. The
                    Board of Governors is directed to include the details of all allocations made pursuant to this subsection in its periodic reports under G.S. 116D-3 to the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations.

                        not issue special obligation bonds under this Article until the effective date of legislation enacted by the General Assembly authorizing the undertaking of the special obligation bond project to be financed and fixing the maximum
                        aggregate principal amount of special obligation bonds that shall be issued for that purpose. In submitting proposed special obligation bond projects to the General Assembly for approval, the Board of Governors shall submit information

                        A trust agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the holders of the special obligation bonds and the rights, remedies, and immunities of the trustee or trustees, if any, and may restrict the individual right
                        of action by the holders. In addition to the foregoing, a trust agreement or resolution may contain other provisions the Board of Governors considers reasonable and proper for the security of the holders. All expenses incurred
                        in carrying out the provisions of the trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the special obligation bond projects for which the special obligation bonds are issued or as an expense of operation of
                        the special obligation bond project.

                        of Governors is authorized, to the extent the generation of the obligated resources is in the control of the Board, to fix, revise from time to time, charge, and collect the rents, charges, fees, or other revenues constituting

                    Session Laws 2000-3, s. 3(c), provides: "The match requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 115D</a></cite> of the General Statutes apply to bond proceeds allocated in this section
                    for new construction except as provided in this subsection. The consultant hired by the State Board of Community Colleges to determine funding formulas for the community college system developed an index to measure each county's ability
                    to pay. The consultant found that some counties are unable to meet their local match requirement under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 115D</a></cite> of the General Statutes because
                    of inability to pay. The consultant recommended applying the 'ability to pay' index to generate an adjusted matching rate. Accordingly, community colleges are required to match bond proceeds allocated for new construction in this section
                    only as follows: Community colleges assigned an adjusted matching rate of less than forty percent (40%) in the ability to pay portion of the formula adopted by the State Board of Community Colleges in March 2000 are not required to
                    match, and community colleges assigned an adjusted matching rate of forty percent (40%) or more in the ability to pay portion of the formula are required to match only at the assigned rate."

                    project for which bond proceeds are allocated in this act, the Board shall certify that fact to the State Treasurer by October 1, 2007. All of these bond proceeds with respect to which the Board certifies that the matching requirement

                    extent and as provided in this act. The Director of the Budget is empowered, when the Director of the Budget determines it is in the best interest of the State and the North Carolina Community College System to do so, and if the cost
                    of a particular project is less than the projected allocation, to use the excess funds to increase the size of that project or increase the size of any other project itemized in this section, or to increase the amount allocated to
                    a particular community college within the aggregate amount of funds available under this section. The Director of the Budget shall consult with the Advisory Budget Commission and the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations
