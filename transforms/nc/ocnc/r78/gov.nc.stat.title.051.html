                        Requirements of Statute. - Intent of the person performing the ceremony is not a relevant factor in determining whether a valid marriage has resulted; there is nothing in the statute requiring that a valid marriage ceremony is contingent upon the persons
                        being married understanding or agreeing with all the legal consequences of that marriage. In re Estate of Peacock, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 788 S.E.2d 191 (2016), review denied, 793

                        When Marriage Is Complete. - Marriage is in law complete when parties able to contract and willing to contract have actually contracted to be man and wife, in the forms and with the solemnities required by law. Consummation by carnal knowledge is not
                        necessary to its validity. State v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. 346</cite> (1842).

                        Instructions Defining "Church" and "Religious Denomination" Properly Refused. - In a bigamy prosecution in which the crucial determination was whether the person before whom a purported prior marriage of defendant was solemnized was an ordained minister
                        of any religious denomination or a minister authorized by his church, the determination of whether there was a church or a religious denomination was not for the jury, since it was a matter of ecclesiastical law, and the trial
                        court properly refused to give defendant's requested instructions defining "church" and "religious denomination." State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 608, 265 S.E.2d 491, rev'd on other

                        Mail-Order Minister Not Qualified to Perform Valid Ceremony. - A ceremony solemnized by a Roman Catholic layman in the mail order business, who bought for $10.00 a mail order certificate giving him "credentials of minister" in the Universal Life Church,
                        Inc., was not a ceremony of marriage to be recognized for purposes of a bigamy prosecution in this State. State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 479</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 349 (1980). But see G.S. 51-1.1

                        Husband showed a "minister" ordained by the Universal Life Church was unauthorized to perform a marriage ceremony, under G.S. 51-1, because the parties stipulated the relevant facts were the same as in a North Carolina Supreme Court decision negating
                        such a person's authority. Duncan v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 754 S.E.2d 451 (2014).

                        Impersonation of Minister. - A private citizen who impersonates an ordained minister and, with the consent of the parties, solemnizes a marriage between a man and woman is not guilty of any criminal offense known to the common or statute law. State v.

                        Evidence of Marriage by Justice of Peace. - It is sufficient evidence of a marriage that it was solemnized by one in the known enjoyment of the office of justice of the peace, and acting as such. His commission need not be produced. State v. Robbins,

                        Marriage by Unqualified Celebrant Was Voidable. - Wife's marriage to her first husband under Islamic law was voidable because they did not have a marriage license and the ceremony failed to meet statutory requirements, but the wife never terminated the
                        marriage. The marriage was still valid when she married her second husband; therefore, the second marriage was bigamous and void. Mussa v. Palmer-Mussa, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 719

                        Ceremony Requirements Satisfied. - Ceremony complied with the statute because it was conducted in the presence of a minister authorized to perform marriages, that minister declared that the decedent and the wife were husband and wife, and they seriously
                        and freely expressed their desire to become husband and wife; the reverend's intent to perform a "religious ceremony" but not a "legal ceremony" did not affect the outcome. In re Estate of Peacock,

                        Indian Custom Held Not a Valid Marriage. - There is but one law of marriage for all the residents of this State. Hence cohabitation between an Indian man and woman according to the customs of their tribe, by which the parties were at liberty to dissolve
                        the connection at pleasure, did not constitute a marriage. State v. Ta-cha-na-tah, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 614</cite> (1870), decided prior to the amendment by Session Laws 2001-62, s. 1

                        Legislature May Dispense With Formality. - The substance of marriage, the consent of the parties, existing, it was as clearly within the power of the legislature to dispense with any particular formality as it was to prescribe such. State v. Whitford,

                    <p>
                        Validation by Retroactive Legislation. - It is competent for the legislature by retrospective legislation to give validity to a marriage which is invalid by reason of the nonobservance of some solemnity required by statute. It is otherwise where such
                        marriage is a nullity. Cooke v. Cooke, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. 583</cite> (1868).

                        Wife Need Not Use Husband's Surname. - There is no statutory requirement in this State that a married woman use her husband's surname. In re Mohlman, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 216 S.E.2d 147 (1975).

                    <p>
                        Marriage is Not Invalid Because Solemnized Under an Illegal License. - Trial court erred in affirming the decision of the assistant clerk of court, who ruled a decedent's heirs were his children, and a ceremony did not make the decedent's wife an heir
                        because the ceremony complied with the statutory requirements and, thus, the decedent and the wife were married; the fact that the ceremony was conducted without a license could not serve to invalidate an otherwise properly performed
                        ceremony because a marriage license was not a prerequisite to a valid marriage. In re Estate of Peacock, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 788 S.E.2d 191 (2016), review denied, 793 S.E.2d 227,

                        Annulment Complaint Dismissed. - Dismissal of husband's annulment complaint was affirmed because appellate court was bound by trial court's uncontested finding that the person who conducted the wife's prior marriage ceremony was unauthorized to do so
                        under former G.S. 51-1; from this, it followed that the husband failed to show that his marriage was bigamous. When the existence of a second marriage was established, it was presumed valid until the "attacking party" showed that
                        it was invalid, and the presumption favoring the continuation of a prior marriage, if applicable, yielded to the presumption favoring a second marriage. Mussa v. Palmer-Mussa, <cite class="nc_code">366 N.C. 185</cite>,

                    Any marriages performed by ministers of the Universal Life Church prior to July 3, 1981, are validated, unless they have been invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that all other requirements of law have been met and the marriages
                    would have been valid if performed by an official authorized by law to perform wedding ceremonies.

                        Section Inapplicable. - It was error to conclude that G.S. 51.1, validating marriages performed by ministers of the Universal Life Church performed before July 3, 1981, validated a marriage performed after that date because the statute did not validate
                        later marriages. Duncan v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 754 S.E.2d 451 (2014).

                        Where marriage was never invalidated, this section applied to validate it. The net effect of this section was to render the marriage valid from its inception, as it was voidable, rather than void. Fulton v. Vickery, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C.

       Penalties for Issuance of Marriage Licenses to Individuals of Same Gender.
      </b> - A register of deeds would violate North Carolina law in issuing a marriage license to persons of the same gender and if, in issuing such a license, the register of deeds operates in bad faith he may subject himself to
                    the penalties provided in G.S. 161-27. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Willie L. Covington, Register of Deeds, Durham County Courthouse, 2004 N.C.A.G. 2 (3/29/04).

                <p>
                    All marriages between any two persons nearer of kin than first cousins, or between double first cousins, or between a male person under 16 years of age and any female, or between a female person under 16 years of age and any male, or between persons either
                    of whom has a husband or wife living at the time of such marriage, or between persons either of whom is at the time physically impotent, or between persons either of whom is at the time incapable of contracting from want of will or
                    understanding, shall be void. No marriage followed by cohabitation and the birth of issue shall be declared void after the death of either of the parties for any of the causes stated in this section except for bigamy. No marriage by
                    persons either of whom may be under 16 years of age, and otherwise competent to marry, shall be declared void when the girl shall be pregnant, or when a child shall have been born to the parties unless such child at the time of the
                    action to annul shall be dead. A marriage contracted under a representation and belief that the female partner to the marriage is pregnant, followed by the separation of the parties within 45 days of the marriage which separation has
                    been continuous for a period of one year, shall be voidable unless a child shall have been born to the parties within 10 lunar months of the date of separation.

                        The marriage of a party under the minimum age required by statute is voidable and not void. Such marriage may be ratified by the subsequent conduct of the parties. Koonce v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 194</cite> (1859);

                        Although this section provides that all marriages "between a male person under 16 years of age and any female, or between a female person under 16 years of age and any male . . . shall be void," it is well established that such marriages are voidable
                        rather than void. This was the rule of the common law. Ivery v. Ivery, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 721</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 457 (1963).

                        But May Be Ratified by Subsequent Conduct. - A marriage which is not void ab initio, but merely voidable, because one of the parties thereto was at its date under the age at which he or she might lawfully marry, may be ratified by the subsequent conduct
                        of the parties in recognition of the marriage. Ivery v. Ivery, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 721</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 457 (1963).

                    <p>
                        Bigamous Marriages Are Void. - The fact that a presumption which has arisen of the death of a woman's husband shields her from prosecution for bigamy upon marrying another, does not render the last marriage any the less bigamous or void if the first husband
                        is, in fact, alive. Ward v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 55</cite>, 23 S.E. 926 (1896).

                        Where a wife attempts to marry again when no valid divorce a vinculo has been obtained from her living husband, such second attempted marriage is absolutely void and may be annulled by the husband of the second attempted marriage in an action instituted
                        for that purpose. Pridgen v. Pridgen, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 533</cite>, 166 S.E. 591 (1932).

                        A bigamous marriage is a nullity, with no legal rights flowing from it, and can be collaterally attacked at any time. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 244</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 542 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Wife's marriage to her first husband under Islamic law was voidable because they did not have a marriage license and the ceremony failed to meet statutory requirements, but the wife never terminated the marriage. The marriage was still valid when she
                        married her second husband; therefore, the second marriage was bigamous and void. Mussa v. Palmer-Mussa, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 719 S.E.2d 192 (2011).

                        And Are Subject to Collateral Attack. - A marriage between parties, either of whom has a living spouse at the time of the purported marriage, is void ab initio and such a marriage being a nullity, it may be attacked collaterally at any time; no legal
                        rights flow from it. Redfern v. Redfern, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 270 S.E.2d 606 (1980).

                    <p>
                        But Second Marriage Is Presumed Valid. - When two marriages of the same person are shown and both parties to the first marriage are living at the time of the second marriage, the second marriage is presumed to be valid and the first marriage is presumed
                        to have been dissolved by divorce. Parker v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 265 S.E.2d 237 (1980).

                    <p>
                        Wife who knowingly entered a bigamous marriage was subsequently estopped from asserting the invalidity of that marriage in order to avoid the consequences flowing from her wrongful conduct; therefore, the trial court correctly terminated husband's obligation
                        to pay alimony under the separation agreement. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 244</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 542 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Impotency Renders Marriage Voidable. - Impotency in a husband does not render a marriage by him void ab initio, but only voidable by sentence of separation, and until such sentence, it is deeded valid and subsisting. Smith v. Morehead,
                        <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. 360</cite> (1863).

                    <p>
                        Marriage of One Incapable of Contracting for Want of Understanding Is Voidable. - Under the common law as modified by this section and G.S. 50-4, a marriage of a person incapable of contracting for want of understanding is not void, but voidable. Geitner
                        ex rel. First Nat'l Bank v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 312 S.E.2d 236, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 744</cite>, 315 S.E.2d 702 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the rule of the common law as modified by statute, the marriage of a person incapable of contracting for want of understanding is not void ipso facto, but if and when declared void in a legally constituted action, such marriage is void ab initio.

                    <p>
                        What Constitutes Mental Capacity. - As to what constitutes mental capacity or incapacity to enter into a contract to marry, the general rule is that the test is the capacity of the person to understand the special nature of the contract of marriage and
                        the duties and responsibilities which it entails, which is to be determined from the facts and circumstances of each case. Geitner ex rel. First Nat'l Bank v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite>                        159, 312 S.E.2d 236, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 744</cite>, 315 S.E.2d 702 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Knowledge of the provisions of the statutory law relating to the revocation of a will by marriage and relating to the persons who shall succeed to the estate of an intestate is not a prerequisite or necessary element of mental capacity sufficient to contract
                        a valid marriage. Ivery v. Ivery, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 721</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 457 (1963).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Test of Incompetency in Guardianship Matters Compared. - Tests judicially applied for a determination of incompetency in guardianship matters differ markedly from those applied for the determination of mental capacity to contract a marriage, for even
                        though a person may be under guardianship as an incompetent, he may in fact have sufficient mental capacity to validly contract marriage. Geitner ex rel. First Nat'l Bank v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite>                        159, 312 S.E.2d 236, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 744</cite>, 315 S.E.2d 702 (1984).

                    <p>
                        Mental capacity of a party at the precise time when the marriage is celebrated controls its validity or invalidity. Geitner ex rel. First Nat'l Bank v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 312 S.E.2d 236, cert.
                        denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 744</cite>, 315 S.E.2d 702 (1984).

                    <p>
                        Prior adjudication of incompetency is not conclusive on the issue of later capacity to marry and does not bar a party from entering into a contract to marry. Geitner ex rel. First Nat'l Bank v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite>                        159, 312 S.E.2d 236, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 744</cite>, 315 S.E.2d 702 (1984).

                    <p>
                        Burden of Persuasion as to Invalidity for Lack of Mental Capacity. - When the fact of marriage has been established by evidence, the burden of persuasion on the issue of invalidity is on the party asserting such. And even if a party's insanity is proved
                        to be of such a chronic nature that it is presumed to continue, it does not shift the burden of the issue. Geitner ex rel. First Nat'l Bank v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 312
                        S.E.2d 236, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 744</cite>, 315 S.E.2d 702 (1984).

                        Undue Influence. - Where an executrix had filed a case on a decedent's behalf as his guardian ad litem, seeking an annulment of the decedent's marriage while the decedent was alive, and where substantial property rights hinged on the validity of the marriage,
                        the action did not abate on the decedent's death and the executrix was entitled to pursue it; further, as there was no evidence showing the birth of issue into the union between the decedent and the wife, G.S. 51-3 did not preclude

                        There is a difference between declaring a marriage valid and preventing one from asserting its invalidity. The theory behind the equitable estoppel doctrine is not to make legally valid a void divorce or to make an invalid marriage valid, but rather,
                        to prevent one from disrupting family relations by allowing one to avoid obligations as a spouse. Mayer v. Mayer, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 311 S.E.2d 659, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 760</cite>,

                        Equitable Estoppel to Attack Divorce. - Equitable estoppel is dependent upon events which led to the divorce or which may have occurred after the divorce. It is a personal disability of the party attacking the divorce judgment; it is not a function of
                        the divorce decree itself. Mayer v. Mayer, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 311 S.E.2d 659, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 760</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 140 (1984).

                        Husband who encouraged his wife to obtain a divorce from her prior spouse was estopped from questioning its validity. This problem most commonly arises when a man persuades a married woman to divorce her husband so that she will be free to marry him.
                        When he does so, or even when he merely marries her with full knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the divorce, he is estopped to question the validity of the divorce, since he has engaged in conduct calculated to induce
                        reliance on the divorce, and indeed, he has relied on it himself. Mayer v. Mayer, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 311 S.E.2d 659, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 760</cite>, 321

                        Annulment Complaint Dismissed. - Dismissal of husband's annulment complaint was affirmed because appellate court was bound by trial court's uncontested finding that the person who conducted the wife's prior marriage ceremony was unauthorized to do so
                        under former G.S. 51-1; from this, it followed that the husband failed to show that his marriage was bigamous. When the existence of a second marriage was established, it was presumed valid until the "attacking party" showed that
                        it was invalid, and Ascertaining if the wife's purported prior marriage was void or voidable was irrelevant to determining if the husband had met his burden of proof. Mussa v. Palmer-Mussa, <cite class="nc_code">366 N.C. 185</cite>,

                    No minister, officer, or any other person authorized to solemnize a marriage under the laws of this State shall perform a ceremony of marriage between a man and woman, or shall declare them to be husband and wife, until there is delivered to that person
                    a license for the marriage of the said persons, signed by the register of deeds of the county in which the marriage license was issued or by a lawful deputy or assistant. There must be at least two witnesses to the marriage ceremony.

                <p>
                    Whenever a man and woman have been lawfully married in accordance with the laws of the state in which the marriage ceremony took place, and said marriage was performed by a magistrate or some other civil official duly authorized to perform such ceremony,
                    and the parties thereafter wish to confirm their marriage vows before an ordained minister or minister authorized by a church, or in a ceremony recognized by any religious denomination, federally or State recognized Indian Nation or
                    Tribe, nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit such confirmation ceremony; provided, however, that such confirmation ceremony shall not be deemed in law to be a marriage ceremony, such confirmation ceremony shall in no way affect
                    the validity or invalidity of the prior marriage ceremony performed by a civil official, no license for such confirmation ceremony shall be issued by a register of deeds, and no record of such confirmation ceremony may be kept by a
                    register of deeds.

                        A marriage is not invalid because solemnized under an illegal license. Maggett v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 71</cite>, 16 S.E. 919 (1893); Wooley v. Bruton, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 438</cite>, 114 S.E. 628

                        Trial court erred in affirming the decision of the assistant clerk of court, who ruled a decedent's heirs were his children, and a ceremony did not make the decedent's wife an heir because the ceremony complied with the statutory requirements and, thus,
                        the decedent and the wife were married; the fact that the ceremony was conducted without a license could not serve to invalidate an otherwise properly performed ceremony because a marriage license was not a prerequisite to a valid
                        marriage. In re Estate of Peacock, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 788 S.E.2d 191 (2016), review denied, 793 S.E.2d 227, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2016).

                        the persons are authorized to be married in accordance with the laws of this State. In making a determination as to whether or not the parties are authorized to be married under the laws of this State, the register of deeds may
                        require the applicants for the license to marry to present certified copies of birth certificates or such other evidence as the register of deeds deems necessary to the determination. The register of deeds may administer an oath

                        the applicant's social security number. If an applicant does not have a social security number and is ineligible to obtain one, the applicant shall present a statement to that effect, sworn to or affirmed before an officer authorized
                        to administer oaths. Upon presentation of a sworn or affirmed statement, the register of deeds shall issue the license, provided all other requirements are met, and retain the statement with the register's copy of the license.

                        License Not Issued Until Filled Out. - A blank marriage license, though signed by the register of deeds, is not issued until it is filled out and handed to the person who is to be married, or to someone for him, and if at the time of such issuance the
                        register has become functus officio, the failure to record it does not render him liable to the penalty imposed by G.S. 51-18 and G.S. 51-19 for failure to record the substance of each marriage license issued. Maggett v. Roberts,

                            "Reasonable Inquiry". - By reasonable inquiry is meant such inquiry as renders it probable that no impediment to the marriage exists. Bowles v. Cochran, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 398</cite> (1885).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It would seem that "reasonable inquiry" involves at least an inquiry made of, or information furnished by, some person known to the register to be reliable, or, if unknown, identified and approved by some reliable person known to the register. This is
                            the rule upon which banks act in paying checks, and surely in the matter of such grave importance as issuing a marriage license the register should not be excused upon a less degree of care. Trolinger v. Boroughs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 312</cite>, 45 S.E. 662 (1903); Furr v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 157</cite>, 52 S.E. 664 (1905); Joyner v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 295</cite>, 72 S.E. 970 (1911);
                            Gray v. Lentz,
                            <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 346</cite>, 91 S.E. 1024 (1917).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The requirement of reasonable inquiry is not merely a formal matter, which is met by taking the oaths of the husband or other parties unknown to the register, but it is expressive of a sound principle of public policy designed to protect immature persons
                            from hasty and ill-advised marriages, made without the consent of their parents or guardians or those properly having the care over them. Julian v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 549</cite>,
                            95 S.E. 907 (1918).

                            Reasonable Inquiry Precludes Liability. - The register is not liable to the penalty when he has made reasonable inquiry and has been deceived, without laches on his part. Williams v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 300</cite>,
                            7 S.E. 786 (1888); Cole v. Laws, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 651</cite>, 10 S.E. 172 (1889); Agent v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 29</cite>, 32 S.E. 322 (1899); Laney v. Mackey, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 630</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Examination under Oath Discretionary. - G.S. 51-8 does not require that the register shall make inquiry by examination of the applicant under oath, but merely declares that he shall have "the power to do so." His using, or failing to use, such discretionary
                            power is merely a circumstance to be considered by the jury. Furr v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 157</cite>, 52 S.E. 664 (1905); Joyner v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 295</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Sworn Statements of Unknown Persons Insufficient. - It is not sufficient that the register takes the sworn statements of the parties or their friends not known to him. Snipes v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 349</cite>,
                            102 S.E. 619 (1920).

                        <p>
                            Instances of Reasonable Inquiry. - When a reliable man of good character applied for a license, and produced to the register a written statement purporting to give to age of the female as over 18 years, and also the name and residence of the parents,
                            and the person producing the statement said it was true, though no name was signed to it, it was held that the register had made such inquiry as was required of him, and was not liable for the penalty. Bowles v. Cochran,
                            <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 398</cite> (1885).

                        <p>
                            For other cases where inquiry was held reasonable, see Walker v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 481</cite>, 13 S.E. 907 (1891); Harcum v. Marsh, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 154</cite>, 41 S.E. 6 (1902).

                        <p>
                            Instances of Lack of Reasonable Inquiry. - When the register issued a license for the marriage of a woman under 18 years of age, without the assent of her parents, upon the application of one of whose general character for reliability he was ignorant,
                            and who falsely stated the age of the woman, without making any further inquiry as to his sources of information, it was held that he had not made such reasonable inquiry into the facts as the law required, and he incurred
                            the penalty for the neglect of his duty in that respect. Cole v. Laws, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 651</cite>, 10 S.E. 172 (1889).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To the same effect are the following cases: Williams v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 300</cite>, 7 S.E. 786 (1888); Trolinger v. Boroughs, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 312</cite>, 45 S.E. 662 (1903); Morrison v.

                            Written Consent Prerequisite to Issuance of Certain Licenses. - A register of deeds is not permitted to issue a marriage license where one of the parties is under 18 years of age, until the consent in writing of the person under whose charge he or she
                            is shall be delivered to the register. The written consent is a condition precedent to the issuance of the license. Coley v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 21</cite> (1884).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As to requirement under former law of consent of father, if living, see Littleton v. Haar, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 566</cite>, 74 S.E. 12 (1912); Owens v. Munden, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 266</cite>, 84 S.E. 257

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The word "father" used in the former statute did not include "stepfather," and the written consent of the mother, the father being dead, would authorize the issuing of the license. Owens v. Munden, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 266</cite>,
                            84 S.E. 257 (1915).

                            Violation of Section. - Issuance of a marriage license by a register of deeds in violation of the section is not an indictable offense, unless the illegal act is done mala fide. State v. Snuggs, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 541</cite>                            (1881).

                            Venue. - An action for the penalty under this section should be tried in the county wherein the cause of action arises, and if brought in the wrong county, it should be removed and not dismissed. Dixon v. Haar, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 341</cite>,

                            Effect of Register's Death. - Under former G.S. 1-74, it was held that an action for a penalty against a register of deeds and the surety on his official bond abated on the death of the officer. Wallace v. McPherson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 297</cite>, 51 S.E. 897 (1905). For present provisions as to abatement of actions, see G.S. 1A-1, Rule 25.

                            Allegations in Complaint. - In an action under this section, it is essential that the complaint should allege that the register issued the license knowingly or without reasonable inquiry. Maggett v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 174</cite>,

                            Burden of Proof. - The burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to show that the officer issued the license when he knew of the impediment to the marriage, or that it was forbidden by the law, or when he had not made reasonable inquiry. Trolinger v. Boroughs,

                            Presumption as to Time of Issuance. - The presumption is that a marriage license, signed by a register of deeds, was issued during his term of office. The burden of proving the contrary is on the party asserting it. Maggett v. Roberts,
                            <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 71</cite>, 16 S.E. 919 (1893).

                            Evidence. - In a civil suit against a register, evidence of nolo contendere pleaded by the husband in a criminal action was not admissible. Snipes v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 349</cite>, 102 S.E. 619 (1920).

                            Proof of the officer's failure to administer the oath to the applicant for the license is admissible to show a lack of reasonable inquiry. Laney v. Mackey, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 630</cite>, 57 S.E. 386 (1907).

                            The testimony of a witness as to the age of the woman, depending solely upon her statements to him which he repeated to the register when the license was applied for, was not substantive evidence of her age. Joyner v. Harris,
                            <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 295</cite>, 72 S.E. 970 (1911).

                            "Reasonable Inquiry" as Question for Jury. - Where there is a conflict of evidence, whether there has been "reasonable inquiry" is to be submitted to the jury upon all the evidence under proper instructions. Joyner v. Roberts,

                        <p>
                            The fact that the register administered an oath to the applicant and his friend did not, of itself, exonerate him. He was permitted by the statute to do so, so that he might better elicit the facts, and his doing so or failing to do so would be but a
                            circumstance for the jury to consider. Gray v. Lentz, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 346</cite>, 91 S.E. 1024 (1917).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the evidence is conflicting as to the reasonableness of the inquiry made by the register, the question should be submitted to the jury, and a judgment as of nonsuit thereon is erroneously entered. Lemmons v. Sigman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 238</cite>, 106 S.E. 764 (1921).

                            Instructions. - If the facts are admitted, it is the duty of the court to instruct the jury whether they are sufficient to constitute "reasonable inquiry"; if they are in controversy, it is the duty of the court to instruct the jury that certain facts
                            to be determined from the evidence do or do not constitute "reasonable inquiry." Spencer v. Saunders, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 183</cite>, 126 S.E. 420 (1925).
