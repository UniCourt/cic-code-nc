                        Change in Common-Law Rule. - The common-law rule that the wife should bring her action for divorce in the domicile of her husband was changed by this section, as amended by Laws 1915, c. 229, making the summons returnable to the county in which either
                        the plaintiff or defendant resides. Wood v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 227</cite>, 106 S.E. 753 (1921).

                        Requirements to Invoke Statute. - There did not have to be a pending motion or trial date to invoke <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-3" target="_self">G.S. 50-3</a></cite> because the statute required a transfer so that a
                        motion in the cause might be resolved in a new county at some future point and did not require the underlying motion to be pending but only that there be an ongoing alimony proceeding that had not been finally resolved, which criteria
                        were satisfied by indicating a motion to modify or terminate alimony would be filed in the future. Scheinert v. Scheinert, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 818 S.E.2d 114 (2018).

                        Any Superior Court Has Jurisdiction If Either Party Is Domiciled in State. - In the absence of fraud, the superior court of any county in this State has jurisdiction over divorce action if either of the parties is domiciled in this State. Stokes v. Stokes,
                        <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 203</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 315 (1963).

                        But If Plaintiff Conceals Action and Whereabouts of Defendant, Jurisdiction Is Lacking. - If a plaintiff should fraudulently conceal his action for a divorce from the defendant and the whereabouts of the defendant from the court, jurisdiction would be
                        lacking and a divorce obtained upon service of summons by publication would be a nullity. Stokes v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 203</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 315 (1963).

                        Venue Provisions of This Section Are Not Jurisdictional. - The provisions of this section that in divorce proceedings the summons shall be returnable to the court of the county in which either the plaintiff or the defendant resides are not jurisdictional;
                        they relate only to venue. Stokes v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 203</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 315 (1963).

                        other county, it may be tried there, unless defendant before the time of answering expires demands in writing that trial be had in the proper county. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 506</cite>,

                        But Removal Provisions Are Mandatory. - The language of this section, as amended by Session Laws 1977, 2nd Sess., c. 1223, which added the second paragraph, is mandatory. If the defendant makes a motion for change of venue, the judge shall grant it. Gardner
                        v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 678, 260 S.E.2d 116 (1979), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 715</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 468 (1980).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was error to deny a husband's motion to change venue because (1) removal of all claims filed in the same action was required, and (2) all removal prerequisites were met. Dechkovskaia v. Dechkovskaia, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite>                        26, 780 S.E.2d 175 (2015).

                    <p>
                        When a trial court's equitable distribution order was vacated and the court's alimony order was remanded for reconsideration, this procedural posture did not exempt the case from the venue provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-3" target="_self">G.S. 50-3</a></cite>                        because (1) the statute's mandatory provisions applied before or after judgment, and (2) remand proceedings should have occurred in a different county, since the venue statute was raised before those proceedings began. Dechkovskaia
                        v. Dechkovskaia, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 780 S.E.2d 175 (2015).

                    <p>
                        And Apply Retroactively to Causes Which Have Accrued. - The retroactive application of this section to causes of action which accrued prior to the effective date of the statute is proper. No vested right is destroyed, nor does a question of construction
                        arise, where a venue statute, by its own provisions, is declared to apply to transactions entered into prior to the passage of the statute. Gardner v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 678,
                        260 S.E.2d 116 (1979), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 715</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 468 (1980).

                    <p>
                        But Not to Actions Settling Venue Before Effective Date. - The amendment of this section providing for removal of an action for divorce or alimony, upon motion of defendant, to the county in which defendant resides, where plaintiff has ceased to be a
                        resident of this State, is mandatory and may be applied retroactively and even to actions pending on its effective date. However, the amendment would not be applicable to an action for divorce from bed and board where it became
                        effective after the trial court made a decision settling the question of venue. Gardner v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 678, 260 S.E.2d 116 (1979), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 715</cite>,

                        As Right to Venue as Adjudicated Is Substantial. - Although the question of venue is a procedural one, a right to venue established by statute is a substantial right. Its status is secure when finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction,
                        and neither the courts nor the legislature can thereafter invalidate the right's exercise or annul the judgment which fixes its investiture. Gardner v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 715</cite>,

                        Contempt Venue. - It was error to hold a husband in civil contempt because (1) while venue was normally proper in the county in which the order allegedly violated was issued, the husband asserted the husband's statutory right to a change of venue, under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-3" target="_self">G.S. 50-3</a></cite>, so all subsequent proceedings had to be held in the county with proper venue, and, (2) the trial court had to reconsider the court's alimony award before
                        that award was enforceable by contempt. Dechkovskaia v. Dechkovskaia, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 780 S.E.2d 175 (2015).

                        Limitation on Retroactive Application of Section. - This statute may be applied retroactively only insofar as it does not impinge upon a right which is otherwise secured, established, and immune from further legal metamorphosis. Gardner v. Gardner,
                        <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 715</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 468 (1980).

                        Propriety of Motion to Remove. - This section is not jurisdictional and may be waived, and the failure therein must be taken advantage of by motion to remove the cause to the proper venue, and not by motion to dismiss. Davis v. Davis,

                    <p>
                        Failure to Make Motion as Waiver. - Any action brought in the wrong county may be removed instead of being dismissed, and a failure to make the motion for removal is a waiver of objection to the county in which it is brought. Denson v. Denson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 703</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 507 (1961).

                        Void and Voidable Marriages Compared. - A voidable marriage is valid for all civil purposes until it is annulled by a competent tribunal in a direct proceeding, but a void marriage is a nullity and may be impeached at any time. Geitner ex rel. First Nat'l
                        Bank v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 312 S.E.2d 236, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 744</cite>, 315 S.E.2d 702 (1984).

                        Formal Decree When Marriage Is Absolutely Void. - Even though a marriage may be absolutely void, without being so declared, yet the court will formally decree its nullity, for the sake of the good order of society as well as for the quiet and relief of
                        the party seeking the relief. Johnson v. Kincade, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. 470</cite> (1843); Lea v. Lea, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 603</cite>, 10 S.E. 488 (1889).

                        Marriage Induced by Duress. - A former marriage which has been decreed to be void because it was induced by duress was void ab initio, and hence did not afford ground for annulment of a later marriage between one of the parties and a third person, though
                        such decree was rendered after the second marriage. Taylor v. White, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 38</cite>, 75 S.E. 941 (1912).

                        Test of Mental Capacity to Contract Marriage. - As to what constitutes mental capacity or incapacity to enter into a contract to marry, the general rule is that the test is the capacity of the person to understand the special nature of the contract of
                        marriage and the duties and responsibilities which it entails, which is to be determined from the facts and circumstances of each case. Geitner ex rel. First Nat'l Bank v.

                        though he may be under guardianship as an incompetent, a person may have in fact sufficient mental capacity to validly contract marriage. Geitner ex rel. First Nat'l Bank v.

                        Void Ab Initio When So Declared. - Under the rule of the common law as modified by statute, the marriage of a person incapable of contracting for want of understanding is not void ipso facto, but if and when it is declared void in a legally constituted
                        action, such marriage is void ab initio. Ivery v. Ivery, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 721</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 457 (1963).

                        The court has jurisdiction to declare marriages in proper cases void ab initio, but the marriage of a lunatic is not so ipso facto, and must be so declared by a decree of the court. Watters v. Watters, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 411</cite>,

                        Standing to Institute Action. - An action to declare void a marriage of a person incapable of contracting for want of understanding may be instituted in the lifetime of the parties thereto by a guardian for the alleged mentally incompetent person or by
                        such mentally incompetent person if and when he or she becomes mentally competent to do so; and unless such marriage is followed by cohabitation and the birth of issue, such action may be instituted after the death of such mentally
                        incompetent person by a person or persons whose legal rights depend upon whether such marriage is valid or void. Ivery v. Ivery, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 721</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 457 (1963).

                        A suit for nullity of marriage on the ground of insanity may be brought either in the name of the lunatic, by her guardian, or in the name of the guardian, though the former is, for some reasons, the preferable course. Crump v. Morgan,

                        Burden of Persuasion as to Invalidity. - When the fact of marriage has been established by evidence, the burden of persuasion on the issue of invalidity is on the party asserting such. And even if a party's insanity is proved to be of such a chronic nature
                        that it is presumed to continue, it does not shift the burden on the issue. Geitner ex rel. First Nat'l Bank v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 312 S.E.2d 236, cert. denied,

                        action to revoke and cancel the license issued by him before the solemnization of the marriage. Sawyer v. Slack, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 697</cite>, 146 S.E. 864 (1929).

                        Effect of 20 Years' Ratification. - Where a marriage is entered into by one under the legal age, but is followed by a cohabitation of 20 years, the parties acknowledging each other and being recognized as husband and wife, although such marriage in its
                        inception was invalid, by reason of such ratification by the parties it would not be declared void. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 711</cite>, 11 S.E. 517 (1890).

                        Procedure Similar to Divorce Action. - An action, under this section, to have a marriage declared void, so far as procedure is concerned, is an action for divorce. Lea v. Lea, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 603</cite>, 10 S.E.
                        488 (1889); Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 91</cite>, 53 S.E. 623 (1906).

                    <p>
                        In Johnson v. Kincade, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. 470</cite>, (1843), the marriage of the parties was declared a nullity because of the mental incapacity of one of the parties at the time of the marriage. In that decision the
                        court declared that the "plaintiff ought to be, and is divorced from the defendant." See Lea v. Lea, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 603</cite>, 10 S.E. 488 (1889); Taylor v. White, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 38</cite>, 75 S.E.

                        Effect of Annulment Decree. - A decree annulling a marriage is final and conclusive and not open to collateral impeachment, although it may be vacated or set aside for good cause on proper application. Its effect is to make the supposed or pretended marriage
                        as if it had never existed, and hence it restores both parties to their former status and to all rights of property as before the marriage. Taylor v. White, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 38</cite>, 75 S.E.

                        notice to counsel of record in the original action is not sufficient. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 91</cite>, 53 S.E. 623 (1906).

                        Collateral Attack by Second Husband on Wife's Former Divorce Decree Not Authorized. - Where a divorce decree obtained by defendant wife from her former husband on the ground of separation for one year was in all respects regular on the face of the record,
                        the divorce decree was not void but merely voidable even though there was proof that defendant and her former husband had not lived separate and apart for one year as of the time of the divorce; therefore, plaintiff husband had
                        no standing collaterally to attack the divorce decree as to show that his subsequent marriage to defendant was void ab initio. Maxwell v. Woods, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 267 S.E.2d

       § 50-5.1. Grounds for absolute divorce in cases of incurable insanity.
      </b>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In all cases where a husband and wife have lived separate and apart for three consecutive years, without cohabitation, and are still so living separate and apart by reason of the incurable insanity of one of them, the court may grant a decree of absolute
                    divorce upon the petition of the sane spouse: Provided, if the insane spouse has been released on a trial basis to the custody of his or her respective spouse such shall not be considered as terminating the status of living "separate
                    and apart" nor shall it be considered as constituting "cohabitation" for the purpose of this section nor shall it prevent the granting of a divorce as provided by this section. Provided further, the evidence shall show that the insane
                    spouse is suffering from incurable insanity, and has been confined or examined for three consecutive years next preceding the bringing of the action in an institution for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered or, if not
                    so confined, has been examined at least three years preceding the institution of the action for divorce and then found to be incurably insane as hereinafter provided. Provided further, that proof of incurable insanity be supported
                    by the testimony of two reputable physicians, one of whom shall be a staff member or the superintendent of the institution where the insane spouse is confined, and one regularly practicing physician in the community wherein such husband
                    and wife reside, who has no connection with the institution in which said insane spouse is confined; and provided further that a sworn statement signed by said staff member or said superintendent of the institution wherein the insane
                    spouse is confined or was examined shall be admissible as evidence of the facts and opinions therein stated as to the mental status of said insane spouse and as to whether or not said insane spouse is suffering from incurable insanity,
                    or the parties according to the laws governing depositions may take the deposition of said staff member or superintendent of the institution wherein the insane spouse is confined; and provided further that incurable insanity may be
                    proved by the testimony of one or more licensed physicians who are members of the staff of one of this State's accredited four-year medical schools or a state-supported mental institution, supported by the testimony of one or more
                    other physicians licensed by the State of North Carolina, that each of them examined the allegedly incurable insane spouse at least three years preceding the institution of the action for divorce and then determined that said spouse
                    was suffering from incurable insanity and that one or more of them examined the allegedly insane spouse subsequent to the institution of the action and that in his or their opinion the said allegedly insane spouse was continuously
                    incurably insane throughout the full period of three years prior to the institution of the said action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In lieu of proof of incurable insanity and confinement for three consecutive years next preceding the bringing of the action in an institution for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered prescribed in the preceding paragraph, it shall be sufficient
                    if the evidence shall show that the allegedly insane spouse was adjudicated to be insane more than three years preceding the institution of the action for divorce, that such insanity has continued without interruption since such adjudication
                    and that such person has not been adjudicated to be sane since such adjudication of insanity; provided, further, proof of incurable insanity existing after the institution of the action for divorce shall be furnished by the testimony
                    of two reputable, regularly practicing physicians, one of whom shall be a psychiatrist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In lieu of proof of incurable insanity and confinement for three consecutive years next preceding the bringing of the action in an institution for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered, or the adjudication of insanity, as prescribed in the
                    preceding paragraphs, it shall be sufficient if the evidence shall show that the insane spouse was examined by two or more members of the staff of one of this State's accredited four-year medical schools, both of whom are medical doctors,
                    at least three years preceding the institution of the action for divorce with a determination at that time by said staff members that said spouse is suffering from incurable insanity, that such insanity has continued without interruption
                    since such determination; provided, further, that sworn statements signed by the staff members of the accredited medical school who examined the insane spouse at least three years preceding the commencement of the action shall be admissible
                    as evidence of the facts and opinions therein stated as to the mental status of said insane spouse as to whether or not said insane spouse was suffering from incurable insanity; provided, further, that proof of incurable insanity under
                    this section existing after the institution of the action for divorce shall be furnished by the testimony of two reputable physicians, one of whom shall be a psychiatrist on the staff of one of the State's accredited four-year medical
                    schools, and one a physician practicing regularly in the community wherein such insane person resides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all decrees granted under this subdivision in actions in which the insane defendant has insufficient income and property to provide for his or her own care and maintenance, the court shall require the plaintiff to provide for the care and maintenance
                    of the insane defendant for the defendant's lifetime, based upon the standards set out in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.5ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.5(a)</a></cite>. The trial court will retain jurisdiction
                    of the parties and the cause, from term to term, for the purpose of making such orders as equity may require to enforce the provisions of the decree requiring plaintiff to furnish the necessary funds for such care and maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Service of process shall be held upon the regular guardian for said defendant spouse, if any, and if no regular guardian, upon a duly appointed guardian ad litem and also upon the superintendent or physician in charge of the institution wherein the insane
                    spouse is confined. Such guardian or guardian ad litem shall make an investigation of the circumstances and notify the next of kin of the insane spouse or the superintendent of the institution of the action and whenever practical confer
                    with said next of kin before filing appropriate pleadings in behalf of the defendant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all actions brought under this subdivision, if the jury finds as a fact that the plaintiff has been guilty of such conduct as has conduced to the unsoundness of mind of the insane defendant, the relief prayed for shall be denied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plaintiff or defendant must have resided in this State for six months next preceding institution of any action under this section.

                        Purpose. - The purpose of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5" target="_self">G.S. 50-5(6)</a></cite>, as amended (recodified as this section) is to require that a person alleged to be incurably insane shall not have
                        his or her marital status altered until such person has been committed to an institution for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered for a period of five (now three) successive years in order that it may be ascertained
                        whether or not the inmate's insanity is incurable. Mere confinement for a period of five (now three) successive years in such an institution would fulfill the literal meaning of the statute but it would not be in compliance with
                        its spirit or purpose. Mabry v. Mabry, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 126</cite>, 90 S.E.2d 221 (1955).

                        Exclusive Remedy. - The remedy provided in former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5" target="_self">G.S. 50-5(6)</a></cite> (recodified as this section) is exclusive. Lawson v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 52</cite>,

                        Section Not Ambiguous. - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5" target="_self">G.S. 50-5(6)</a></cite>, recodified as this section, is not ambiguous. Vaughan v. Vaughan, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 253, 166

                    <p>
                        The words "next preceding" in former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5" target="_self">G.S. 50-5(6)</a></cite> (recodified as this section) have been held to mean the time nearest to the bringing of the action. Vaughan v.
                        Vaughan, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 253, 166 S.E.2d 530 (1969).

                    <p>
                        It is not sufficient under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5" target="_self">G.S. 50-5(6)</a></cite> (recodified as this section) that the insane spouse was confined to an institution for five (now three) consecutive
                        years at some time prior to the commencement of the action; the statute requires that confinement must be for five (now three) consecutive years "next preceding" the bringing of the action, which means the time nearest the bringing
                        of the action. Vaughan v. Vaughan, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 253, 166 S.E.2d 530 (1969).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        "Confined." - By the use of the word "confined" in former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5" target="_self">G.S. 50-5(6)</a></cite> (recodified as this section), the legislature did not contemplate such confinement as would
                        require an inmate to be at all times under lock and key. Mabry v. Mabry, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 126</cite>, 90 S.E.2d 221 (1955); Vaughan v. Vaughan, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 253, 166 S.E.2d 530 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Release on Probation. - In a proceeding by wife for divorce on the ground of husband's insanity, where doctors testified that the husband was incurably insane, the fact that the husband during the five-year (now three-year) period of confinement had been
                        released on probation to his relatives on separate occasions, once for 10 days and once for six months, did not bar divorce of wife on the ground of insanity, since release on probation did not constitute such acts on the part
                        of the hospital authorities as to terminate the period of confinement within the meaning of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5" target="_self">G.S. 50-5(6)</a></cite> (recodified as this section).
                        Mabry v. Mabry, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 126</cite>, 90 S.E.2d 221 (1955).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Periods of probation are permissible under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5" target="_self">G.S. 50-5(6)</a></cite> (recodified as this section) and may be deemed not to have constituted an interruption of the confinement
                        or a discharge from the hospital within the meaning of the statute. Vaughan v. Vaughan, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 253, 166 S.E.2d 530 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Defendant's discharge under former G.S. 122-67 terminated his confinement and he was, therefore, not confined for five years (now three years) next preceding the institution of the action as required by former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5" target="_self">G.S. 50-5(6)</a></cite>                        (recodified as this section).

                    <p>
                        Proof of Separation. - In a suit for divorce on the statutory ground of insanity, the insanity must be the reason for the separation of the parties, but no greater proof of separation and its continuance during the five-year (now three-year) period is
                        required than in a proceeding for divorce based on a two-year (now one-year) separation period. Mabry v. Mabry, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 126</cite>, 90 S.E.2d 221 (1955).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Separation Occasioned by Mental Incompetency Other Than Incurable Insanity. - Separation occasioned by insanity is cause for divorce in North Carolina only in cases of incurable insanity. And in these cases the requirements of this section must be met.
                        In all other instances of separation arising by reason of mental incompetency, such separation is not a ground for divorce. But to bar an action for divorce based on two (now one) years' separation under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-6" target="_self">G.S. 50-6</a></cite>, the mental impairment must be to such extent that defendant does not understand what he or she is engaged in doing, and the nature and consequences
                        of the act. Moody v. Moody, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 752</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 724 (1961).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expert Testimony Insufficient. - Defendant's expert testimony did not satisfy the requirements of this section where only one of defendant's medical experts associated with a four-year North Carolina medical school made any determination of defendant's
                        condition three years prior to the institution of the action for divorce. Scott v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 284</cite>, 442 S.E.2d 493 (1994).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sufficient Evidence. - In action for divorce based on one year's separation, where defendant wife asserted incurable mental illness as a defense, although plaintiff offered no expert evidence concerning the diagnosis of defendant's condition, plaintiff's
                        own testimony showed defendant's ability to perform usual daily tasks when her illness was controlled with medication; moreover, the testimony of defendant's treating psychiatrist and the person most familiar with her condition
                        over an extended period of time corroborated certain of plaintiff's evidence. Scott v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 284</cite>, 442 S.E.2d 493 (1994).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Extent of Impairment. - To bar an action for divorce based on one year's separation, the mental impairment must be to such extent that defendant does not understand what he or she is engaged in doing and the nature and consequences of the act. Scott v.
                        Scott, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 284</cite>, 442 S.E.2d 493 (1994).

                    <p>
                        Burden of Persuasion. - To bar an action for divorce based on one year's separation, the defendant bears the burden of persuasion that he or she is incurably insane within the meaning and purpose of this section. Scott v. Scott,
                        <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 284</cite>, 442 S.E.2d 493 (1994).

       § 50-6. Divorce after separation of one year on application of either party.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Marriages may be dissolved and the parties thereto divorced from the bonds of matrimony on the application of either party, if and when the husband and wife have lived separate and apart for one year, and the plaintiff or defendant in the suit for divorce
                    has resided in the State for a period of six months. A divorce under this section shall not be barred to either party by any defense or plea based upon any provision of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-7" target="_self">G.S. 50-7</a></cite>,
                    a plea of res judicata, or a plea of recrimination. Notwithstanding the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11" target="_self">G.S. 50-11</a></cite>, or of the common law, a divorce under this section shall not affect
                    the rights of a dependent spouse with respect to alimony which have been asserted in the action or any other pending action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether there has been a resumption of marital relations during the period of separation shall be determined pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.052.html#t52s52-10.2" target="_blank">G.S. 52-10.2</a></cite>. Isolated
                    incidents of sexual intercourse between the parties shall not toll the statutory period required for divorce predicated on separation of one year.

                            Constitutionality. - This section, as amended, is not unconstitutional on grounds that it violates equal protection by preserving a dependent spouse's right to alimony without at the same time preserving all other property rights incident to continuation
                            of the marital status, as the equal protection clauses of the State and federal Constitutions prohibit denial of the equal protection of the laws to persons, not to rights. Edwards v. Edwards,

                            Abolition of the defense of recrimination in a divorce action based on a year's separation does not deprive a spouse who was married before such abolition of a vested property right under the due process clause of the federal Constitution or the "law
                            of the land clause" of N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s2">
    §

                            This section is an indication of this State's policy, as exhibited by legislation, that if the parties have lived separate and apart for one year, the marriage is no longer viable and is not worth saving. Bruce v. Bruce,

                            And Provides for "No Fault" Divorce. - As to divorces grounded on a one-year separation of the parties, this State is a "no fault" jurisdiction; that is, a showing that the parties have achieved the required periods of residency and separation is all
                            that is necessary to obtain a divorce in this State under this section. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 262 S.E.2d 359 (1980).

                        <p>
                            Jurisdictional Requirements. - Under this section, in order to maintain an action for divorce, the husband and wife shall have (1) lived separate and apart for two years (now one year), and (2) the plaintiff, husband or wife, shall have resided in this
                            State for a period of one year (now six months). These two requirements are jurisdictional, and if either one or the other of these elements does not exist, the court would not have jurisdiction to try the action and any decree
                            rendered would be void. Henderson v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 1</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 227 (1950).

                            Under this section, in order to maintain an action for divorce, the husband and wife shall have (1) lived separate and apart for two years (now one year); and (2) the plaintiff, husband or wife, shall have resided in this State for a period of six months.
                            The jurisdictional requirement as to residence under this section is met by allegation and proof of residence within this State for a period of six months next preceding the commencement of the action. Denson v. Denson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 703</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 507 (1961).

                            To obtain a divorce pursuant to this section, all that is required is proof that the parties have lived separate and apart for one year and that one of the parties has lived in this State for six months next preceding institution of the suit. Bruce v.
                            Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 339 S.E.2d 855, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 701</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 36 (1986).

                            Statute of Limitations Not Applicable to Actions for Absolute Divorce. - Balancing the reasons for having statutes of limitation against this State's public policy of endeavoring to maintain the marital state on the one hand and not denying divorce to
                            parties who have demonstrated a ground for divorce on the other hand, the general, residuary statute of limitations, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa5As1-56" target="_blank">G.S. 1-56</a></cite>,
                            should not be applied to actions for absolute divorce under this section. Bruce v. Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 339 S.E.2d 855, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 701</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 36

                        <p>
                            Accrual of Cause of Action. - Separation, as a ground for divorce, is a type of continuing offense. It begins on the date the parties physically separate with the requisite intention that the separation remain permanent, and the cause of action under
                            this section accrues at the end of one year. However, the cause of action continues to accrue even after the one year period, so long as the parties remain "separate and apart" within the meaning of the statute. Bruce v. Bruce,
                            <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 339 S.E.2d 855, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 701</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 36 (1986).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But, the cessation of sexual relations alone does not constitute separation. Lin v. Lin, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 772, 425 S.E.2d 9 (1993).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An interlocutory appeal to determine the date of separation for the purposes of equitable distribution was rightfully dismissed, as the parties had been separated for a period far in excess of one year and as the date of separation was irrelevant to the
                            validity of the divorce. Stafford v. Stafford, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 94</cite>, 520 S.E.2d 785 (1999).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Proper Parties. - The only persons who may bring an action for absolute divorce are those persons who are lawfully married to one another. Where there are children born to a marriage, it is neither proper nor necessary for them to be made parties to an
                            action for divorce between their parents. Likewise, the only necessary parties in an action to set aside an absolute divorce decree after one spouse's death are the surviving spouse and the personal representative of the deceased
                            spouse. Thomas v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 638, 260 S.E.2d 163 (1979).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Required Findings. - The court erred in declaring the parties' divorce decree void where the divorce decree at issue was "in all respects regular on [its] face" and the defendant was properly served; the court's findings, required by this section, were
                            found under the heading "Conclusions of Law" rather than under "Findings of Fact." Dunevant v. Dunevant, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 542 S.E.2d 242 (2001).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Applicability of G.S. 50-10. - The application to divorces under this section of the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-10" target="_self">G.S. 50-10</a></cite> requirement that the factual allegations supporting the divorce
                            must be deemed denied requires a finding of the necessary facts. While it remains sound public policy not to allow the granting of such divorces on the pleadings, it would, nevertheless, appear that it would make good jurisprudential
                            sense to clearly remove divorces under this section from the more cumbersome jury procedure and provide that all such cases be heard by the judge without a jury. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 69,
                            262 S.E.2d 359 (1980).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Allegations and Proof Sufficient to Entitle Plaintiff to Divorce. - Where the complaint alleges, and there is evidence tending to show, that husband and wife, "have lived separate and apart for two years (now one year)" next immediately preceding the
                            institution of the action, and that plaintiff "has resided in the State for a period of six months," nothing else appearing, the establishment of these allegations by proof would entitle plaintiff to a divorce. This section
                            so provides. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 80</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 492 (1945).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is unnecessary to set out in the complaint the cause of the separation or to allege that it was without fault on the part of plaintiff or to aver that it was by mutual agreement of the parties. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 80</cite>,
                            33 S.E.2d 492 (1945).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to be entitled to a divorce on the ground of separation, plaintiff must show the fact of marriage, that the parties have lived separate and apart for two years (now one year), and that plaintiff has been a resident of the State for one year (now
                            six months). Oliver v. Oliver, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 299</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 549 (1941).

                            Where, in an action under this section, the testimony adduced by plaintiff is sufficient to establish, at the commencement of the action, that the plaintiff and defendant were husband and wife, that both of them had resided in the State for a period of
                            six months, and that they had lived separate and apart within the meaning of the statute for an uninterrupted period of two years (now one year), the trial judge rightly refused to nonsuit the action. Mallard v. Mallard,
                            <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 654</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 247 (1951).

                        <p>
                            Complaint seeking an absolute divorce was not fatally defective in failing to allege that the parties lived separate and apart for one year with the intention by at least one of them that the separation be permanent, where it contained the allegations
                            required by this section. Sharp v. Sharp, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 351 S.E.2d 799 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's summary divorce judgment was not disturbed because it was uncontested that statutory residency and time requirements were met. Khaja v. Husna, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 330, 777 S.E.2d 781 (2015),

                            Joinder of Grounds in Complaint. - Where the grounds are listed in the statutes for the same kind of divorce, the several grounds may be joined in one complaint, and the decree may be granted on any one of the grounds proved. Swygert v. Swygert,
                            <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 173, 264 S.E.2d 902 (1980).

                        <p>
                            Statement in Answer. - In an action under this section, it was held that the mere statement in the answer that the allegation in the complaint "that plaintiff and defendant have not lived together as man and wife since April 1, 1942, is not denied," was
                            not an admission of a "separation." Moody v. Moody, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 89</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 491 (1945).

                        <p>
                            Stay Not Required. - A stay of plaintiff's action for absolute divorce was not required pending resolution of defendant's counterclaim for alimony in plaintiff's earlier action for divorce from bed and board, since defendant's claim for alimony, having
                            been asserted in the prior action, would not be affected by an absolute divorce obtained by plaintiff in the action for absolute divorce. Edwards v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite>                            301, 256 S.E.2d 728 (1979).

                            When Issues to Be Passed on by Jury. - In an action under this section, where the complaint alleged sufficient facts and defendant in her answer set up a divorce a mensa with alimony granted her on the grounds of abandonment, to which plaintiff replied
                            without admission of wrongful or unlawful conduct on his part, a judgment for defendant on the pleadings was erroneous, as there were issues of fact raised to be tried by a jury. Lockhart v. Lockhart,
                            <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 123</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 465 (1943).

                            When Plaintiff May Not Voluntarily Dismiss Claim. - Where plaintiff seeks divorce upon the ground of one year's separation and defendant in his answer likewise prays for a divorce upon the same ground, defendant's prayer is in effect a counterclaim, and
                            plaintiff therefore cannot voluntarily dismiss her claim without defendant's consent. The rationale for this rule is that it would be manifestly unjust to allow a plaintiff who comes into court upon solemn allegations which,
                            if true, entitle defendant to some affirmative relief against the plaintiff, to withdraw, ex parte, the allegations after defendant has demanded the relief to which they entitle him. McCarley v. McCarley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 109</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 490 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Estoppel from Challenging Divorce Judgment. - Where husband filed for divorce and performed some of his obligations under separation agreement for several years, remarried in reliance on the divorce judgment, and did not object to the validity of the
                            divorce decree or the agreement until he sought to defend his failure to comply with the judgment on grounds that it was void, he was estopped from questioning its validity and effect. Amick v. Amick,
                            <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 341 S.E.2d 613 (1986).

                            Modification of Custody Order in Action Under This Section. - An order awarding the custody of minor children determines the present rights of the parties, but is not permanent in nature, and is subject to modification for subsequent change of circumstances
                            affecting the welfare of the children; therefore, an order of the court, entered pursuant to former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>, awarding the custody
                            of the children to the wife, did not preclude another judge of the superior court from awarding custody of the children to the husband in the wife's later action for absolute divorce under this section. Thomas v. Thomas,
                            <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 461</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 871 (1963).

                        <p>
                            Child Support Action Not Barred. - The inclusion in divorce judgment of a paragraph identifying plaintiff's former husband as the father of plaintiff's child operated only to identify the existence of a child born of the marriage and was not the subject
                            of litigation; thus, collateral estoppel did not bar child support action against defendant. Guilford County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Unit ex rel. Gardner v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite>                            527, 473 S.E.2d 640 (1996).

                            Evidence of Mental Impairment. - In action for divorce based on one year's separation where defendant wife asserted incurable mental illness as a defense, although plaintiff offered no expert evidence concerning the diagnosis of defendant's condition,
                            plaintiff's own testimony showed defendant's ability to perform usual daily tasks when her illness was controlled with medication; moreover, the testimony of defendant's treating psychiatrist and the person most familiar with
                            her condition over an extended period of time, corroborated certain of plaintiff's evidence. Scott v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 284</cite>, 442 S.E.2d 493 (1994).

                        <p>
                            Mental Impairment. - To bar an action for divorce based on one year's separation, the mental impairment must be to such extent that defendant does not understand what he or she is engaged in doing and the nature and consequences of the act. Scott v. Scott,
                            <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 284</cite>, 442 S.E.2d 493 (1994).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly excluded evidence of defendant's health and her prospects for obtaining medical insurance following divorce. Such evidence is not relevant to the trial court's determination to grant or deny a divorce pursuant to this section. Fletcher

                            Alimony. - When a husband was granted an absolute divorce on the grounds of separation for one year, and the wife did not file a counterclaim or separate claim for alimony before the trial court entered a judgment of absolute divorce, which did not preserve
                            an alimony claim, a statement in the wife's answer that "the claims for alimony and equitable distribution pending this action are to be reserved" was insufficient to give the trial court jurisdiction, under
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11" target="_self">G.S. 50-11</a></cite>, to consider the wife's amended answer and counterclaim for alimony, despite the husband's answer to that counterclaim, as subject matter jurisdiction
                            could not be conferred by the parties' consent. Stark v. Ratashara, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 628 S.E.2d 471 (2006), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 536</cite>, 633 S.E.2d 826 (2006).

     Many of the cases below were decided prior to the 1987 amendment to this section, providing that isolated incidents of sexual intercourse shall not toll the statutory period for divorce predicated on one year separation. As to resumption of marital relations, see <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.052.html#t52s52-10.2" target="_blank">G.S. 52-10.2</a></cite>.

                            Parties Must Have Lived Separate and Apart for One Year. - The material aspect of this statute is the requirement that the parties have lived separate and apart for one year prior to institution of the suit. Myers v. Myers,
                            <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 302 S.E.2d 476 (1983).

                            The expression used in Byers v. Byers, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 298</cite>, 22 S.E.2d (1942), "that the bare fact of living separate and apart for the period of two years (now one year); standing alone, will not constitute
                            a cause of action for divorce," should be viewed in the light of its setting, and construed accordingly. It was not intended as a delimitation of the statute. Byers v. Byers, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 85</cite>, 25 S.E.2d
                            466 (1943).

                            Separation Requirement Applies to Year Prior to Institution of Suit. - The requirement that parties live separate and apart for one year applies to the year prior to institution of the suit.

                            The separation contemplated by this section is apparently unrestricted. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 80</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 492 (1945).

                            Mutual Agreement to Separate Is Not Required. - A charge by the court to the jury that the living separate and apart means living separate and apart under mutual agreement only, was erroneous, entitling plaintiff to a new trial. Byers v. Byers,
                            <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 298</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 902 (1942), distinguishing Parker v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 264</cite>, 186 S.E. 346 (1936), decided under prior wording of section. See 15 N.C.L. Rev. 348

                            In order to be entitled to a divorce, a plaintiff need not show that a marital separation for the statutory period was by mutual agreement or under a decree of court. Beck v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite>                            163, 187 S.E.2d 355 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Husband's physical separation from his wife for the statutory one-year period of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-6" target="_self">G.S. 50-6</a></cite> and his accompanying intention to end the marriage were sufficient
                            to entitle him to an absolute divorce, even though the wife did not know of his intention to end the marriage until less than a year before the husband filed for divorce; there was no requirement under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-6" target="_self">G.S. 50-6</a></cite>                            that the remaining spouse have knowledge of the other party's intention to cease cohabitation.

                            But Was Required Formerly. - Before the 1937 amendment, which struck out of this section the phrase "either under deed of separation or otherwise," it was held that while the applicant need not be the injured party, the statute did not authorize a divorce
                            where the husband had separated himself from his wife, or the wife had separated herself from her husband, without cause and without agreement, express or implied. Lee v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 61</cite>,

                            This section contains no requirement that separation of the parties be voluntary. Harrington v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 260</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 190 (1974). But see Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 91</cite>,
                            29 S.E.2d 39 (1944), holding that the separation under this section must be voluntary in its inception, and Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 80</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 492 (1945), holding that "separation" would not
                            include an involuntary living apart, where there had been no previous separation, such as might arise from the incarceration or insanity of one of the parties.

                        <p>
                            But This Section Is Inapplicable Where Separation Is Due to Insanity of Defendant. - Divorce on the grounds of two years' (now one year's) separation under this section cannot be maintained when the separation is due to the insanity or mental incapacity
                            of defendant spouse, the sole remedy in such instance being under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5" target="_self">G.S. 50-5(6)</a></cite> (recodified as <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-5.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-5.1</a></cite>).

                        <p>
                            To bar an action for divorce based on two years' (now one year's) separation, the mental impairment must be to such an extent that defendant does not understand what he or she is engaged in doing and the nature and consequences of the act. Moody v. Moody,
                            <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 752</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 724 (1961).

                        <p>
                            "Judicial Separation" Included. - A legal separation for the requisite period of two years (now one year) is ground for divorce under this section. The separation here contemplated includes a "judicial separation" as well as one brought about by the act
                            of the parties, or one of them. Lockhart v. Lockhart, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 559</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 444 (1943).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A separation by act of the parties, or one of them, or under order of court a mensa et thoro, suffices to meet the terms of this section. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 80</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 492 (1945).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The effect of a judgment granting a divorce a mensa et thoro was to legalize the separation of the parties which theretofore had been caused by the husband's actions, and after two years (now one year) from the date of such judgment, the husband could
                            proceed to an absolute divorce. Becker v. Becker, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 685</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 507 (1964). See also, Pruett v. Pruett, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 13</cite>, 100 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            The effect of a divorce a mensa et thoro obtained by the wife on the ground that her husband abandoned her, was to legalize their separation from the date of such judgment; and in such case the husband, after two years (now one year) from the date of
                            such judgment, could proceed to an absolute divorce. Richardson v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 705</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 525 (1962).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A judgment in an action instituted under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite> decreeing that the husband had willfully abandoned the wife and awarding her support and maintenance
                            constituted a judicial separation which, two years (now one year) thereafter, would permit the husband to obtain an absolute divorce. Rouse v. Rouse, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 520</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 865 (1963); Wilson
                            v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 347</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 695 (1963).

                        <p>
                            The pendente lite order in the wife's action for divorce from bed and board legalized the separation between the husband and wife, since it provided not only for alimony pendente lite and child custody, but also that the wife have the sole use and peaceful
                            and undisturbed possession of the residence, and such separation having continued for the requisite one year thereafter, the plaintiff-husband became entitled to a divorce. Earles v. Earles,
                            <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 224 S.E.2d 284 (1976).

                        <p>
                            What Constitutes Legalized Separation. - Either an action for a divorce a mensa et thoro, an action for alimony without divorce under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>, or
                            a valid separation agreement may constitute a legalized separation which thereafter will permit either of the parties to obtain an absolute divorce on the ground of one year's separation. Harrington v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 260</cite>,
                            210 S.E.2d 190 (1974).

                        <p>
                            Valid separation agreement legalizes separation from and after the date thereof. Harrington v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 260</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 190 (1974).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            To be valid a separation agreement must be untainted by fraud, must be in all respects fair, reasonable and just, and must have been entered into without coercion or the exercise of undue influence, and with full knowledge of all the circumstances, conditions,
                            and rights of the contracting parties. Eubanks v. Eubanks, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 189</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 562 (1968).

                            Effect of Resumption of Cohabitation upon Separation Agreement. - When separated spouses who have executed a separation agreement resume living together in the home which they occupied before the separation, they hold themselves out as man and wife in
                            the ordinary acceptation of the descriptive phrase. Irrespective of whether they have resumed sexual relations, in contemplation of law, their action amounts to a resumption of marital cohabitation which rescinds their separation
                            agreement insofar as it had not been executed. Further, a subsequent separation will not revive the agreement. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541 (1976).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The same public policy which will not permit spouses to continue to live together in the same home, holding themselves out to the public as husband and wife, to sue each other for an absolute divorce on the ground of separation, or to base the period
                            of separation required for a divorce on any time they live together, will also nullify a separation agreement if the parties resume marital cohabitation. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>,
                            230 S.E.2d 541 (1976).

                        <p>
                            The heart of a separation agreement is the parties' intention and agreement to live separate and apart forever, and when a husband and wife enter into a deed of separation the policy of the law is that they are to live separate. Therefore, they void the
                            separation agreement if they reestablish a matrimonial home. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541 (1976).

                            Sexual intercourse between a husband and wife after the execution of separation agreement voids the contract. Murphy v.

                            Where a reconciliation and resumption of cohabitation has taken place, an order or separation agreement with provisions for future support and an agreement to live apart is necessarily abrogated. Williamson v. Williamson,

                            Grounds for Attacking Deed of Separation. - A married woman may attack the certificate of her acknowledgment and privy examination respecting her execution of a deed of separation, inter alia, upon the grounds of her mental incapacity, infancy, or the
                            fraud of the grantee. Eubanks v. Eubanks, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 189</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 562 (1968).

                            Effect of Decree Denying Alimony. - If a separation is legalized by an award of alimony without divorce, there is no sound reason why it should not also be legalized by a decree denying alimony based upon a finding of no dependency. In each case the court
                            has considered and determined the respective rights and obligations of the separated parties insofar as support is concerned. In neither case is the court able to mend the broken marriage or to force the parties to live together
                            if either persists in continuing to live apart. Cook v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 254 S.E.2d 261 (1979).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The separation of the parties became legalized by the entry of the judgment which denied defendant alimony and by entry of the order which awarded her possession of the house. The parties having lived separate and apart for more than one year after their
                            separation thus became legalized, plaintiff was entitled to maintain an action for an absolute divorce under this section. The adjudication made in the prior action that plaintiff had originally wrongfully abandoned the defendant
                            was not effective as a bar in the later action. Cook v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 254 S.E.2d 261 (1979).

                            Separation means cessation of cohabitation, and cohabitation means living together as man and wife, though not necessarily implying sexual relations. Cohabitation includes other marital responsibilities and duties. Dudley v. Dudley,

                            Physical Separation Must Be Accompanied by Intention to Cease Cohabitation. - A husband and wife live separate and apart for the prescribed period within the meaning of this section when, and only when, these two conditions concur: (1) They live separate
                            and apart physically for an uninterrupted period of two years (now one year); and (2) their physical separation is accompanied by at least an intention on the part of one of them to cease their matrimonial cohabitation. Mallard

                        <p>
                            The bare fact of living separate and apart for the period of two years (now one year), standing alone, will not constitute a cause of action for divorce. There must be at least an intention on the part of one of the parties to cease cohabitation, which
                            must be shown to have existed at the time alleged as the beginning of the separation period. It must appear that the separation is with that definite purpose on the part of at least one of the parties. The exigencies of life
                            and the necessity of making a livelihood may sometimes require that the husband shall absent himself from the wife for long periods, a situation which was not contemplated by the law as a cause of divorce in fixing the period
                            of separation. Byers v. Byers, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 298</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 902 (1942).

                            The words "separate and apart," as used in this section, mean that there must be both a physical separation and an intention on the part of at least one of the parties to cease the matrimonial cohabitation. Earles v. Earles,

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in finding a husband and wife were not separated at the time of the wife's marital misconduct, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1</a></cite>A(3)(a),

                            choking incident involving the parties' son, neither party expressed to the other they wanted to separate and the husband continued to maintain all of his belongings at the marital residence; although the phrase "the date of
                            separation" as used in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a) was not defined, the phrase "separate and apart" as used in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-6" target="_self">G.S. 50-6</a></cite>                            meant there had to be a physical separation and an intention on the part of at least one of the parties to cease matrimonial cohabitation.

                            Evidence of Conjugal Relations Within Statutory Period Before Action. - Sexual relations between spouses separated for less than one year invalidates those obligations of the parties, pursuant to a separation agreement, that are contingent upon the requirement
                            that the parties "live continuously separate and apart" for one year. Higgins v. Higgins, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 358 S.E.2d 553 (1987), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 482</cite>,

                            the conclusion that conjugal relations had ceased for the period prescribed by this section, and supported verdict in defendant's favor and judgment denying plaintiff's suit for divorce on the grounds of two years' (now one
                            year's) separation. Mason v. Mason, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 740</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 204 (1946), decided prior to the 1987 amendment to this section.

         The discontinuance of sexual relations is not in itself a living "separate and apart"

                            Effect of Continuing Support of Spouse. - This section does not contemplate, as essential, a repudiation of all marital obligations, and the fact that the husband has supported the wife will not defeat his action. Byers v. Byers,

                            If a plaintiff in a divorce action on grounds of separation contributes to the support of his wife, solely in an attempt to fulfill the obligation imposed by statute, his conduct is not inconsistent with a legal separation; but if he makes such payments
                            in recognition of his marital status and in discharge of his marital obligations, there is no living separate and apart within the meaning of the statute. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 91</cite>,

                            did not constitute a resumption of marital cohabitation such as to invalidate the parties' separation agreement and bar divorce on the grounds of living separate and apart for one year. Camp v. Camp,

                            "Inclination and Opportunity" Rule Inapplicable to Proof of Resumption of Marital Relations. - The "inclination and opportunity" concept allows a presumption of adulterous sexual intercourse if adulterous inclination and opportunity are shown. The rule
                            applies only to cases of alleged adultery, because adultery is an illegal act which by its very nature is difficult to prove. Such justification of the rule for adultery cases is nonexistent for proof of resumption of marital
                            relations between separated spouses, an act which is not against the law but which merely breaks a contract between the spouses. Williamson v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite>                            315, 311 S.E.2d 325 (1984).

                            home was sufficient to support a judgment denying defendant's motion in the cause to set aside the divorce decree on the ground of want of the jurisdictional requirement of domicile. Bryant v. Bryant,

                            District court properly exercised jurisdiction over the subject matter of the parties' divorce action as in the State of North Carolina subject matter jurisdiction for divorce involves not only bringing the matter in the correct court, but also the court's
                            finding residence by one of the parties for the requisite length of time and verification of the pleadings. In the case at issue, the plaintiff husband sufficiently alleged that he was a citizen and resident of North Carolina
                            for more than six months next preceding the institution of the action and had lived separate and apart from the wife for more than one year next preceding the institution of the action without resuming the marital relationship,

                            either party, if and when the husband and wife have lived separate and apart for one year, and the plaintiff or defendant in the suit for divorce has resided in the State for a period of six months. Andris v. Andris,

                            Finality. - A divorce from bed and board is a final order. There is no such thing as a divorce from bed and board pendente lite. Kale v. Kale, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 99, 212 S.E.2d 234, cert. denied,

                            an award of alimony or divorce, one spouse may not maintain an action to evict the other, get sole custody of the children, and obtain an order for child support; therefore, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion
                            to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, since the complaint attempted to assert, and the court allowed, what appeared to be a "no fault" divorce from bed and board,
                            and such an action does not lie in this State. Harper v. Harper, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 273 S.E.2d 731 (1981).

                            No Requirement for Separation of Parties. - There is no requirement for a separation of the parties in the sense of one moving out of the home before an action can be instituted and prosecuted under this section for divorce from bed and board. Triplett

                            Plaintiff Must Petition for Divorce a Mensa. - A decree of divorce a mensa will not be granted in an action where plaintiff petitioned for absolute divorce. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 168</cite> (1876).

                            Allegations in a cross action for divorce a mensa et thoro, set up by defendant wife in husband's action for divorce, were held sufficient. Ragan v. Ragan, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 36</cite>, 197 S.E. 554 (1938).

                        <p>
                            It is not necessary for the plaintiff to establish all of the grounds for divorce a mensa et thoro alleged in her complaint in order to sustain her action. It is sufficient if she establishes the defendant's guilt of any of the acts that would constitute
                            a cause of action for divorce from bed and board as enumerated in this section. Deaton v. Deaton, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 538</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 626 (1951); Pruett v. Pruett, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 13</cite>,

                        <p>
                            To obtain a divorce from bed and board the law requires that defendant establish only one of the grounds specified in this section. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 497</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 221 (1967).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Failure to Establish Ground for Divorce. - Where in his stipulation to the existence of ground for awarding alimony defendant did not specify which ground, of the ten enumerated in former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.2" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.2</a></cite>,
                            existed to support an alimony award, plaintiff could not automatically assume that the ground stipulated was one of the five grounds also listed in this section. Thus, as she presented no evidence establishing one of the grounds
                            in this section, plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proof as to this issue, and the trial court properly denied her request for a divorce from bed and board. Perkins v. Perkins, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite>                            660, 355 S.E.2d 848, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 633</cite>, 360 S.E.2d 92 (1987).

                            Grounds Available to Husband as Well as Wife. - The grounds for divorce a mensa given by this section are available to the husband as well as to the wife, or as stated by the express language of the statute, to "the injured party." Brewer v. Brewer,

                            When the misconduct of the complaining party is calculated to and does reasonably induce the conduct of defendant relied upon in an action for divorce a mensa et thoro, he or she, as the case may be, will not be permitted to take advantage of his or her
                            own wrong, and the decree of divorce will be denied. Byers v. Byers, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 85</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 466 (1943); Pressley v. Pressley, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 326</cite>,

                            Plaintiff Must Prove Unprovoked Misconduct by Defendant. - To establish the existence of a ground listed in this section, plaintiff must allege and prove acts of misconduct by defendant and show that this misconduct was not provoked by plaintiff's actions.
                            Perkins v. Perkins, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 660, 355 S.E.2d 848, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 633</cite>, 360 S.E.2d 92 (1987).

                            Effect of Delay in Bringing Action. - An unreasonable delay by one party, after a probable knowledge of the criminal conduct of the other, will, if unaccounted for, preclude such party from obtaining a decree for a separation from bed and board. Whittington
                            v. Whittington, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 64</cite> (1836).

                        <p>
                            But a delay of seven years in filing a petition was sufficiently accounted for by allegations that at the happening of the matters relied upon for divorce, the petitioner was a nonresident of the State, and was at the time of suit a pauper. Schonwald

                            Evidence of Acts Occurring "More Than Ten Years Ago". - Where a wife sues her husband for divorce a mensa et thoro, under this section, it is not error to admit on the trial evidence of his misconduct occurring "more than ten years ago" when it is a part
                            of the whole course of his dealings coming down to within six months of the beginning of the action. Page v. Page, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 346</cite>, 83 S.E. 625 (1914).

                            Condonation is an affirmative defense to be alleged and proved by the party relying upon it, and less may be sufficient to destroy condonation than to found an original suit. Cushing v. Cushing, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 181</cite>,
                            139 S.E.2d 217 (1964).

                            Resumption of Marital Relations as Condonation. - Nothing else appearing, the resumption of marital relations after a separation imports a condonation of previous offenses. Cushing v. Cushing, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 181</cite>,
                            139 S.E.2d 217 (1964).

                            Mere Forgiveness Does Not Establish Condonation. - Evidence merely of forgiveness by the plaintiff, in her action for divorce a mensa et thoro against her husband, is insufficient to establish condonation. Page v. Page,
                            <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 346</cite>, 83 S.E. 625 (1914); Jones v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 279</cite>, 91 S.E. 960 (1917).

                        <p>
                            Condonation is forgiveness upon condition, and the condition is that the party forgiven will abstain from like offenses afterwards. If the condition is violated, the original offense is revived. Lassiter v. Lassiter,
                            <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 129</cite> (1885); Cushing v. Cushing, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 181</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 217 (1964).

                            Reconciliation Is Not a Defense to a Divorce from Bed and Board. - A divorce from bed and board is judicial separation. Reconciliation while the action is pending is not a defense to a divorce from bed and board, unlike other concepts such as condonation,
                            that is, the forgiveness of a marital offense constituting a ground for divorce. Howell v. Tunstall, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 703, 308 S.E.2d 454 (1983).

                            But Resumption of Marital Relations Destroys Effect of Divorce. - If the parties reconcile and resume cohabitation as man and wife after a divorce from bed and board is granted, the effect of the divorce from bed and board is destroyed. No court action
                            to end such divorce is necessary. Howell v. Tunstall, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 703, 308 S.E.2d 454 (1983).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A resumption of marital relations would invalidate a divorce a mensa et thoro. Rouse v. Rouse, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 520</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 865 (1963).

                        <p>
                            Findings of Fact Required. - In an action for divorce from bed and board under this section, the trial court should make adequate findings of facts (i.e. specific acts of misconduct) to support the conclusion of law that the noninjured party has (1) abandoned
                            the family; (2) maliciously turned the other out of doors; (3) endangered the life of the other by cruel or barbarous treatment; (4) offered such indignities to the person of the other as to render his or her condition intolerable;
                            or (5) become an excessive user of alcohol or drugs so that the other's life is burdensome. Steele v. Steele, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 244 S.E.2d 466 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Judgment Invalid Without Finding of Grounds. - Where judgment of divorce from bed and board contained absolutely no finding of the existence of any of the grounds for divorce from bed and board cognizable under this section, the district court was without
                            power or authority, and therefore without jurisdiction, to enter it. Allred v. Tucci, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 354 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 166</cite>,

                            Alimony. - Where, in husband's action for divorce a vinculo, the wife sets up a cross action for divorce a mensa, the court has the power to make an order for the payment of alimony upon the jury's determination of the issues in favor of the wife. Norman
                            v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 61</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 927 (1949).

                        <p>
                            In an action for divorce, a verified answer and cross action setting forth a cause of action for divorce a mensa is sufficient to sustain an order allowing alimony pendente lite. Nall v. Nall, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 598</cite>,

                            What Is Abandonment. - One spouse abandons the other where he or she brings their cohabitation to an end without justification, without the consent of the other spouse and without intent of renewing it. Morris v. Morris,

                            There is a distinction between criminal abandonment and the matrimonial offense of desertion. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971).

                            It is not necessary that the husband should leave the State. Witty v. Barham, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 479</cite>, 61 S.E. 372 (1908).

                        <p>
                            Nor is it necessary for the husband himself to depart from his home and leave his wife in order to abandon her. By cruel treatment or failure to provide for her support, he may compel her to leave him, which would constitute abandonment by the husband.
                            Blanchard v. Blanchard, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 152</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 919 (1946), holding evidence insufficient to show abandonment by husband; Somerset v. Somerset, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite>                            473, 165 S.E.2d 33 (1969); Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                            It is not necessary, to constitute abandonment of a wife by the husband, that he leave her, but he may constructively abandon her by treating her with such cruelty as to compel her to leave him. Eudy v. Eudy, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite>                            516, 211 S.E.2d 536, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 71</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 782 (1975).

                            Continued and Persistent Cruelty or Neglect May Constitute Abandonment. - If a husband, by continued and persistent cruelty or neglect, forces his wife to leave his home, he may himself be guilty of abandonment. Somerset v. Somerset,
                            <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 165 S.E.2d 33 (1969).

                            Sleeping in Separate Bedroom Is Not Abandonment. - A husband who has neither left the marital home nor withheld support cannot be found to have abandoned his wife merely by electing to sleep in a separate bedroom. Oakley v. Oakley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 161, 282 S.E.2d 589 (1981).

                            Nor Is Separation by Mutual Agreement. - Abandonment or desertion, as a marital wrong committed by one spouse against the other, does not occur if the parties live apart by mutual agreement. Sauls v. Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 387</cite>,
                            218 S.E.2d 338 (1975).

                        <p>
                            When the complaining spouse has consented to a separation which was not caused by the other's misconduct, the plaintiff cannot obtain a divorce or alimony on the basis of abandonment. Sauls v. Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 387</cite>,

                            Unless Induced by Misconduct of One Spouse. - Where the agreement to separate is induced by the misconduct of one spouse, the other can still maintain the charge of voluntary abandonment. Sauls v. Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 387</cite>,
                            218 S.E.2d 338 (1975).

                        <p>
                            The consent which will bar divorce on grounds of abandonment is a positive willingness on the part of the complainant - a consent not induced by the misconduct of the other spouse - to cease cohabitation. Sauls v. Sauls,
                            <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 387</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 338 (1975).

                            Not Mere Acquiescence in the Inevitable. - Mere acquiescence in a wrongful and inevitable separation, which the complaining spouse could not prevent after reasonable efforts to preserve the marriage, does not make the separation voluntary or affect the
                            right to divorce or alimony. Nor, under such circumstances, is the innocent party obliged to protest or to exert physical force or other importunity to prevent the other party from leaving. Sauls v. Sauls,
                            <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 387</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 338 (1975).

                            Abandonment imports willfulness and maliciously turning the spouse out of doors. Brooks v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 280</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 909 (1946).

                            Plaintiff Must Prove That Abandonment Was Willful. - Where wife sues husband for a divorce from bed and board upon the ground of abandonment under this section, she must prove as an essential part of her case that her husband has willfully abandoned her.
                            Cameron v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 82</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 796 (1952).

                        <p>
                            When Abandonment Is Justified. - The Supreme Court, in applying the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section, has never undertaken to formulate any all-embracing definition or rule of general application respecting what conduct on the part of one
                            spouse will justify the other in withdrawing from the marital relation, and each case must be determined in large measure upon its own particular circumstances. Ordinarily, however, the withdrawing spouse is not justified in
                            leaving the other unless the conduct of the latter is such as would likely render it impossible for the withdrawing spouse to continue the marital relation with safety, health, and self-respect, and as would constitute ground
                            in itself for divorce at least from bed and board. Caddell v. Caddell, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 686</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 923 (1952).

                        <p>
                            Plaintiff Must Prove Absence of Justification. - Where a spouse seeks to recover alimony on the grounds of abandonment, that spouse has the burden of proving each and every element of abandonment, including the absence of justification. Morris v. Morris,
                            <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 266 S.E.2d 381, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 525</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 1 (1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The burden of proof upon a plaintiff alleging defendant's abandonment is not to negate every possible justification for defendant-husband's leaving, but rather to prove only the absence of conduct on her part which rendered it impossible for him to continue
                            in the marriage. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 266 S.E.2d 381, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 525</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 1 (1980).

                            Withdrawal from Home May Be Abandonment Even If Support Is Paid. - A husband may be deemed to have abandoned his wife within the meaning of subdivision (1) of this section, and so be liable for alimony, notwithstanding the fact that, after cohabitation
                            is brought to an end, he voluntarily provides her with adequate support. Whether his withdrawal from the home, followed by such support, constitutes an abandonment which is ground for suit by the wife for divorce from bed and
                            board, and therefore ground for suit by her for alimony without divorce, depends upon whether his withdrawal from the home was justified by the conduct of the wife. Schloss v. Schloss, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 266</cite>,
                            160 S.E.2d 5 (1968), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>.

                        <p>
                            A wife is entitled to her husband's society and the protection of his name and home in cohabitation. The permanent denial of these rights may be aggravated by leaving her destitute or may be mitigated by a liberal provision for her support, but if the
                            cohabitation is brought to an end without justification and without the consent of the wife and without the intention of renewing it, the matrimonial offense of desertion is complete. Richardson v. Richardson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 538</cite>, 151 S.E.2d 12 (1966); Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The husband's willful failure to provide adequate support for his wife may be evidence of his abandonment of her, but the mere fact that he provides adequate support for her does not in itself negative abandonment. Pruett v. Pruett,
                            <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 13</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 296 (1957); Richardson v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 538</cite>, 151 S.E.2d 12 (1966); Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402,

                            Defendant May Not Defeat Action by Making Voluntary Support Payments. - A defendant may not abandon his wife and defeat an action under this section by making voluntary payments which he may abandon at will. Thurston v. Thurston,

                            Acts Held to Constitute Abandonment. - Where a husband drives his wife from his house, or obtains her removal by stratagem, or withholds support from her while there, he is deemed to have abandoned her. Setzer v. Setzer,
                            <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 170</cite>, 38 S.E. 731 (1901).

                        <p>
                            A husband who permitted and encouraged certain of his grown children to remain constantly at home in a drunken condition, and allowed them to curse, abuse, and harass his wife at all hours of the day and night, and who told his wife to get her things
                            out of his house, was guilty of such cruel treatment toward his wife as to constitute an abandonment of her. Bailey v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 412</cite>, 90 S.E.2d 696 (1956).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Allegations that plaintiff was compelled to leave her husband because of his willful failure and refusal to provide her with support and that his failure was without provocation on her part were sufficient to state a cause of action for alimony without
                            divorce on the ground of abandonment. Brady v. Brady, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 299</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 13 (1968).

                            Plaintiff simply moved out of his adjacent apartment and stopped supporting his wife at the same time defendant's earnings ceased and she was entering hospital to undergo surgery; the parties lived together as husband and wife "in the usually accepted
                            sense" until that time at which time plaintiff abandoned defendant. Lin v. Lin, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 772, 425 S.E.2d 9 (1993).

                            Finding of Constructive Abandonment Upheld. - Where the record portrayed defendant as a busy professional who became so completely immersed in his work that, by his conduct, he effectively abandoned his wife and children; additionally, the findings of
                            fact pointed to a pattern of behavior by defendant over a 20-year period where plaintiff was left to her own devices without defendant's assistance in maintaining a family and rearing their children, and, although the court
                            noted that at least 10 years earlier plaintiff wife had told defendant that she needed more of his time and attention and the situation improved somewhat thereafter, it improved only for a short time, these finding supported
                            the court's conclusion that the husband had constructively abandoned his wife. Ellinwood v. Ellinwood, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 682, 381 S.E.2d 162 (1989).

                            Instructions as to Burden of Proof Held Erroneous. - In an action for alimony without divorce on the ground of abandonment, an instruction that the wife had the burden of showing that the husband's separation from her was free of fault on her part and
                            that she was blameless, was erroneous. Likewise, an instruction that plaintiff had the burden of proving that the defendant's separation was wrongful, without charging upon what phase or phases of the evidence defendant's separation
                            would be wrongful, and without defining wrongful except in abstract terms, was insufficient. Caddell v. Caddell, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 686</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 923 (1952).

                            Adverse Ruling in Previous Action. - A denial of alimony in an independent action for alimony without divorce brought by the wife on grounds that her husband maliciously turned her out of doors would conclude her upon her crossbill setting up the same
                            matter in an action thereafter brought by her husband against her for divorce a vinculo. Medlin v. Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 529</cite>, 95 S.E. 857 (1918).

                            Necessary Allegations Under Subdivisions (3) and (4). - A wife, in alleging a cause of action for divorce from bed and board under subdivisions (3) and (4) of this section, must set out with particularity the wrongful acts of the husband upon which she
                            relies and also that such acts were without adequate provocation on her part. Ollis v. Ollis, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 709</cite>, 86 S.E.2d 420 (1955); Pruett v. Pruett, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 13</cite>,

                            Revival of Cause After Condonation. - Much less cruelty or indignity is sufficient to revive a transaction occurring before the condonation, than to support an original suit for divorce.

                            parties had continued to reside together. O'Connor v. O'Connor, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 139</cite>, 13 S.E. 887 (1891).

                            Subdivision (4) Is Remedial. - It would seem that the legislature purposely omitted to specify the particular acts of indignity for which divorces may in all cases be obtained. The matter is left at large under general words, thus leaving the courts to
                            deal with each particular case and to determine it upon its own peculiar circumstances, so as to carry into effect the purpose and remedial object of the statute. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 433</cite>                            (1877); Sanders v. Sanders, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 229</cite>, 72 S.E. 876 (1911).

                        <p>
                            Nature of Indignities. - To entitle a wife to a divorce from bed and board under subdivision (4) of this section, the indignity offered by the husband must be such as may be expected to seriously annoy a woman of ordinary sense and temper, and must be
                            repeated or continued so that it may appear to have been done willfully and intentionally or at least consciously by the husband to the annoyance of the wife. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. 102</cite>                            (1878).

                        <p>
                            Facts in Each Case Are Determinative. - The acts of the husband which will render the wife's condition intolerable and her life burdensome so as to entitle her to a divorce a mensa are largely dependent on the facts in each particular case, including
                            her station in life, temperament, state of health, habits and feelings. Sanders v. Sanders, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 229</cite>, 72 S.E. 876 (1911).

                            Allegations and Proof. - Under subdivision (4) of this section plaintiff must set out with particularity the language and conduct on the part of defendant relied upon, and must allege and prove that such acts were without adequate provocation on her part.

                            Plaintiff's Innocence Must Be Shown - Generally. - The complaint must aver, and facts must be found upon which it can be seen, that the plaintiff did not by her own conduct contribute to the wrongs and abuses of which she complains. White v. White,
                            <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 340</cite> (1881); Garsed v. Garsed, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 672</cite>, 87 S.E. 45 (1915).

                            In North Carolina, a party relying on subdivision (4) must not have provoked the "indignities" of which he complains. Puett v. Puett, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 331 S.E.2d 287 (1985).

                            Same - General Allegation Insufficient. - It is essential that the plaintiff specifically set forth in her complaint the circumstances under which the violence was committed, what her conduct was, and especially what she had done to provoke such conduct
                            on the part of her husband. A general allegation that such conduct was "without cause or provocation on her part" is insufficient. Everton v. Everton, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. 202</cite> (1857);
                            O'Connor v. O'Connor, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 139</cite>, 13 S.E. 887 (1891); Martin v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 27</cite>, 40 S.E. 822 (1902).

                            Failure to Allege and Prove That Husband's Accusations of Infidelity Were False. - In an action for divorce a mensa et thoro and for subsistence, plaintiff alleged that defendant had repeatedly accused her of having sexual relations with her foster father
                            and other men, and her evidence tended to show that all of the specific acts of abuse and misconduct complained of occurred in connection with this accusation. Plaintiff further alleged that she had been faithful and dutiful,
                            and that defendant's acts of abuse and misconduct were without provocation or justification, but did not specifically allege or testify that the accusation was false. It was held that defendant's motion for judgment as of nonsuit
                            should have been allowed, since even if the allegation denying provocation or justification was taken as denial of the charge of infidelity, plaintiff offered no testimony in support of such denial. Lawrence v. Lawrence,
                            <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 624</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 807 (1946).

                        <p>
                            Admissible Evidence of Indignities. - In plaintiff's action for divorce from bed and board, the trial court did not err in admitting into evidence testimony concerning defendant's use of pornographic material in the presence of the parties' minor children,
                            defendant's refusal to provide educational support for one of the parties' adult children, and defendant's sexual advances upon the parties' daughter, since such evidence was relevant to show the circumstances surrounding plaintiff's
                            claim that defendant's acts constituted such indignities to plaintiff's person that her condition was rendered intolerable and her life burdensome. Vandiver v. Vandiver, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite>                            319, 274 S.E.2d 243, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 634</cite>, 280 S.E.2d 449 (1981).

                            Grant of Divorce Reversed Where Husband's Behavior Contributed to Wife's Criticism and Accusations. - In a divorce action under subdivision (4), the judge expressly concluded that the plaintiff-husband was not blameless and the judge's findings compelled
                            the conclusion that the husband's conduct - rescue squad activities despite wife's suspicions of unfaithfulness, public name calling - so contributed to his wife's criticism and accusations and to the parties' repeated arguments
                            that the grant of divorce had to be reversed. Puett v. Puett, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 331 S.E.2d 287 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Illustrative Cases. - Husband's persistent charge of adultery against a virtuous wife, accompanied by a contemptuous declaration that she was no longer his wife and by abandonment of her bed, was such an indignity to wife's person as would entitle her
                            to a partial divorce and to alimony. Everton v. Everton, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. 202</cite> (1857).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where petitioner alleged that her husband had become jealous of her without cause, had shaken his fist in her face and threatened her, and had declared to her face and published to the neighborhood that the child with which she was pregnant was not his,
                            that her condition from such treatment had become intolerable and her life burdensome, and that she had been compelled to quit his house and seek the protection of her father, it was held that she had set out enough to entitle
                            her to alimony pendente lite. Erwin v. Erwin, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. 82</cite> (1858).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where a drunken husband cursed his wife and drove her from his house, and by demonstrations of violence caused her to leave the bedside of a dying child and seek safety and protection at a distance of several miles, this was sufficient cause for divorce
                            under subdivision (4) of this section. Scoggins v. Scoggins, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 348</cite> (1881).

                            A divorce from bed and board will be granted the wife if it is shown that the husband made foul and injurious accusations, refused to bed with wife, and denied that she was his wife. Green v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 533</cite>,
                            42 S.E. 954 (1902).

                        <p>
                            When in an action by a wife for divorce a mensa there was evidence tending to show that plaintiff, in her married life, was free from blame and that defendant's conduct was a long course of neglect, cruelty, humiliation, and insult, repeated and persisted
                            in, it was sufficient to bring the cause within the words of subdivision (4) of this section, that defendant had offered "such indignities to [wife's] person as to render her condition intolerable and her life burdensome."
                            Sanders v. Sanders, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 229</cite>, 72 S.E. 876 (1911).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Allegations that husband had been living in adultery, had repeatedly avowed his loss of affection for and his desire to be rid of his wife, had ejected her from his bed, and had finally ordered her from his home, saying that he never intended to live
                            with her again, stated a cause of action. Pearce v. Pearce, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 307</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 904 (1946).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In plaintiff's action for divorce from bed and board on the ground that defendant had inflicted such indignities upon her as to render her life burdensome, evidence was sufficient to enable the jury to find for plaintiff where it tended to show that at
                            some time prior to 1969 defendant began sleeping and spending the majority of his time in the basement of the parties' home, isolated from plaintiff; that upon moving into the basement, defendant withdrew from active participation

                            that plaintiff indulge him in various unnatural sexual desires; and that subsequent to 1975 defendant was absent from the parties' home every weekend and all holidays until September 24, 1976, when he left the home for good.

                            As a ground for the divorce, the trial court did not err in finding that the wife subjected the husband to indignities that made the husband's life burdensome and the husband's condition intolerable under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-7" target="_self">G.S. 50-7(4)</a></cite>;
                            there was evidence that the wife (1) was involved in an extramarital affair, (2) wrecked the marital home after being ordered to leave it, (3) twice had the husband removed after filing false domestic violence proceedings,
                            (4) was physically violent to the husband, (5) left the husband on three occasions without telling the husband where she was going, and (6) did not return for three or four nights.

                    The plaintiff shall set forth in his or her complaint that the complainant or defendant has been a resident of the State of North Carolina for at least six months next preceding the filing of the complaint, and that the facts set forth
                    therein as grounds for divorce, except in actions for divorce from bed and board, have existed to his or her knowledge for at least six months prior to the filing of the complaint: Provided, however, that if the cause for divorce is
                    one-year separation, then it shall not be necessary to allege in the complaint that the grounds for divorce have existed for at least six months prior to the filing of the complaint; it being the purpose of this proviso to permit a
                    divorce after such separation of one year without awaiting an additional six months for filing the complaint: Provided, further, that if the complainant is a nonresident of the State action shall be brought in the county of the defendant's
                    residence, and summons served upon the defendant personally or service of summons accepted by the defendant personally in the manner provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,

                    personally accepted service of the summons and the case was tried and final judgment entered in a court of this State in a county other than the county of the defendant's residence, is hereby validated and declared to be legal and

                            Such Allegations Are Indispensable Constituent Elements of Cause of Action. - The legal effect of the 1951 amendment to this section is that the allegations required to be set forth in the complaint are now indispensable constituent elements of plaintiff's
                            cause of action, and the facts so alleged must be established by the verdict of a jury. Pruett v. Pruett, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 13</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 296 (1957).

                        <p>
                            The allegations required by this section are indispensable constituent elements of a divorce action and must be established either by the verdict of a jury or by a judge, as the pertinent statute may permit. Eudy v. Eudy,

                            Statement in General Terms. - The matters in the jurisdictional affidavit (now the complaint) in an action for divorce a mensa brought by the wife may be stated in general terms following the language of the statute. Sanders v. Sanders,

                            Allegation of Six Months' Prior Knowledge - Generally. - The affidavit (now the complaint) must state that the action was not brought within six months from the time the plaintiff first acquired knowledge of the facts stated therein. Clark v. Clark,
                            <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 28</cite>, 45 S.E. 342 (1903). See also, O'Connor v. O'Connor, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 139</cite>, 13 S.E. 887 (1891); Green v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 533</cite>, 42 S.E.

                        <p>
                            Six months' prior knowledge was formerly not required to be alleged in the complaint. Kinney v. Kinney, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 321</cite>, 63 S.E. 97 (1908).

                        <p>
                            While, in an action for divorce a mensa, it is advisable that the pleading allege that the facts set forth therein as grounds for divorce had existed to complaint's knowledge for at least six months prior to the filing of the pleading in accordance with
                            the language of the statute, where the wife's pleading in her cross-action for divorce a mensa alleged gross mistreatment of her by the husband, culminating in his locking her out of her home and ordering her away on a specified
                            date more than six months prior to the filing of the pleading, with verification that the facts alleged therein were true to her own knowledge, her pleading would be held sufficient on this aspect. Pruett v. Pruett,

                            Same - When Unnecessary. - By Laws 1925, c. 93, this section was amended so that in cases where the cause for divorce is five years' (now one year's) separation, then the six months' prior knowledge need not be alleged. Ellis v. Ellis,

                            Section Requires Complaint to Set Forth Certain Information as to Children. - This section requires that in all divorce actions the complaint shall set forth the name and age of any minor child or children of the marriage, and that in the event there
                            are no minor children of the marriage, the complaint shall so state. Jones v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 607, 202 S.E.2d 279, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 234</cite>,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Allegations of the names and ages of any children of a party seeking divorce in North Carolina are required by this section, in order that the court may protect the interests of such children if the parties have failed to do so. Powers v. Parisher,
                            <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 409 S.E.2d 725 (1991), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 286</cite>, 417 S.E.2d 254 (1992).

                        <p>
                            The obvious reason for this requirement is to bring to the attention of the court any minor children that might be affected by the divorce, to the end that the court will protect the interests of those children. Jones v. Jones,
                            <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 607, 202 S.E.2d 279, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 234</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 23 (1974); Cobb v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 373, 256 S.E.2d 722 (1979).

                        <p>
                            The reason for the requirement of this section for a pleading relating to minor children is not to establish jurisdiction. Cobb v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 373, 256 S.E.2d 722 (1979).

                        <p>
                            Answer Constituting Counterclaim. - Where the complaint in a suit for an absolute divorce alleged facts entitling either or both of the parties to the marriage to an absolute divorce, defendant's answer admitting these allegations, together with his prayer
                            for an absolute divorce on the same grounds, was in effect a counterclaim seeking affirmative relief and arising out of the same transactions alleged in the complaint. McCarley v. McCarley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 109</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 490 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Proof Must Correspond to Allegations. - As the allegations in a petition for divorce are directed by statute to be sworn to, it is more emphatically required in such a case than in others that the allegations and proofs should correspond; otherwise the
                            court cannot decree a divorce. Foy v. Foy, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. 90</cite> (1851); Young v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 340</cite>, 34 S.E.2d 154 (1945).

                            In a divorce action a verification is required as an essential part of the complaint. The want of a proper verification is a fatal defect and a cause for dismissal of the action. Boyd v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C.

                            Verification of a pleading stating that it was "sworn and subscribed to" was not sufficient. Martin v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 27</cite>, 40 S.E. 822 (1902).

                            Verification of Answer Setting Up Cross-Action. - In husband's action for divorce a vinculo, wife's answer setting up a cross-action must be verified under this section, as a jurisdictional prerequisite, and when the answer is not so verified the granting
                            of permanent alimony is erroneous. Silver v. Silver, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 191</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 834 (1941).

                        <p>
                            Verification of Counterclaim. - A decree of divorce was not improperly granted because of defective verification of defendant-husband's pleadings, where the counterclaim in which the divorce was prayed for was verified, although the original pleadings
                            were not. Swygert v. Swygert, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 173, 264 S.E.2d 902 (1980).

                            Impeachment of Verification. - Such uncertainties as plaintiff expressed under cross-examination as to the exact nature of his act in verifying a complaint afforded an insufficient basis to warrant impeachment of his verification. Accordingly, the court
                            erred in allowing defendant's motion to strike the verification and in dismissing plaintiff's complaint. Skinner v. Skinner, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 222 S.E.2d 258, cert. denied,

                            Effect of False Swearing on Decree. - If a decree of divorce, regular in all respects on the face of the judgment roll, is obtained by false swearing, by way of pleading and of evidence, relating to the cause or ground for divorce, the decree is voidable
                            but not void, and is immune from attack by either party to the divorce. Carpenter v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 286</cite>, 93 S.E.2d 617 (1956).

                            In an action for annulment of a marriage entered into between plaintiff husband and defendant wife following a decree of divorce in favor of defendant against her former husband, plaintiff, who had been married to defendant for six years, could not attack
                            the divorce decree by alleging false swearing of defendant in regard to the ground or cause for divorce. Carpenter v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 286</cite>, 93 S.E.2d 617 (1956).

                            In an action for divorce the affidavit formerly required by this section in connection with the complaint was jurisdictional, and a complaint accompanied by a false statutory affidavit would be regarded as insufficient to empower the court to grant a
                            decree of divorce; the correct procedure for relief against the decree would be by motion in the cause. Young v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 340</cite>, 34 S.E.2d 154 (1945), wherein the
                            plaintiff was held to have practiced imposition upon the court.

                            Residency for Six Months Required. - In order to obtain a valid divorce in North Carolina, the plaintiff or defendant must have resided in this State for at least six months next preceding institution of the action for divorce. Eudy v. Eudy,
                            <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 211 S.E.2d 536, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 71</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 782 (1975).

                            A bona fide "residence," necessary under statutes in order to confer jurisdiction in divorce proceedings, is within the legal meaning of the word "domicile," that is, an abode animo manendi, a place where a person lives or has his home, to which, when
                            absent, he intends to return, and from which he has no present purpose to depart. Rector v. Rector, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 240, 166 S.E.2d 492 (1969).

                        <p>
                            "Residence" means actual residence, and prior to the 1949 amendment, which allows suit to be brought where defendant has been a resident of the State for six months, a nonresident wife in suing for divorce could not avail herself of the maxim that "her
                            domicile was that of her husband," where she had not actually satisfied the residence requirement. Schonwald v. Schonwald, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 367</cite> (1856).

                        <p>
                            Separate Domicile for Wife. - North Carolina divorce statutes recognize the legality of a separate domicile, or residence, for the wife. Rector v. Rector, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 240, 166 S.E.2d 492 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is no logical, legal or equitable reason for allowing wife, whose misconduct has brought about the separation, to insist upon the legal fiction that her domicile follows that of her husband, and thereby to defeat his action for divorce brought in
                            the jurisdiction in which she actually resides. Rector v. Rector, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 240, 166 S.E.2d 492 (1969).

                            One need not be a citizen of the United States in order to establish residence or domicile within this State for purposes of divorce actions. Rector v. Rector, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 240, 166 S.E.2d 492 (1969).

                            Effect of Temporary Removal. - Where husband and wife establish a residence in this State, the wife, by leaving the State for a temporary purpose, without any intention of changing her residence, does not thereby lose her citizenship. Moore v. Moore,
                            <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 333</cite>, 41 S.E. 943 (1902).

                            The domicile of a soldier or sailor in the military or naval service of his country generally remains unchanged, domicile being neither gained nor lost by being temporarily stationed in the line of duty at a particular place, even for a period of years.
                            A new domicile may, however, be acquired if both the fact and the intent concur. Israel v. Israel, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 391</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 713 (1961).

                            Naval officer was properly found to be domiciled in North Carolina where: (1) He had changed his voter registration from Pennsylvania to Guilford County, (2) He had filed a North Carolina income tax return for the year 1981, (3) He had changed his permanent
                            address with the Navy to his father's address in Greensboro as of August 1, 1981, (4) He had opened a bank account in Greensboro in August, 1981 and had maintained it since that time, (5) He had changed the registration of
                            his motor vehicle from Pennsylvania to North Carolina and had paid North Carolina property taxes, (6) He had resided at his parents' house whenever on leave from the Navy, and (7) He had severed all ties with the State of Pennsylvania.
                            In short, plaintiff did everything possible to establish a residence in North Carolina. The transient nature of his career with the United States Navy prohibited him from doing anything further. Andris v. Andris,
                            <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 688, 309 S.E.2d 570 (1983).

                            Residency Established Via Verified Complaint. - District court properly exercised jurisdiction over the subject matter of the parties' divorce action as in the State of North Carolina subject matter jurisdiction for divorce involves not only bringing
                            the matter in the correct court, but also the court's finding residence by one of the parties for the requisite length of time and verification of the pleadings. In the case at issue, the plaintiff husband sufficiently alleged
                            that he was a citizen and resident of North Carolina for more than six months next preceding the institution of the action and had lived separate and apart from the wife for more than one year next preceding the institution
                            of the action without resuming the marital relationship, with those district court findings being supported by the husband's verified complaint, which was treated as an affidavit. Wilson v. Wilson,

         Not Advisable for Attorney to Act as Notary and Verify Client's Divorce Complaint.
        </b> - It is not advisable for a notary who is also a partner in a law firm acting of counsel to an attorney filing a divorce complaint to notarize the verification of the client. A divorce complaint which is not properly
                            notarized is subject to dismissal. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James Lee Knight, Notary Public, Guilford County, 58 N.C.A.G. 35 (1988).

                            When one partner of Firm A appears as attorney for a plaintiff in a divorce proceeding, the other partners in the firm also appear, and they could be prohibited under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.047.html#t47a01s47-8" target="_blank">G.S. 47-8</a></cite>                            from notarizing the verification of the client. This would be true whether or not the firm appears as "of counsel" to the individual partner on the face of the complaint or answer. Therefore, such practice should be avoided,
                            and as an attorney/notary who acts in this fashion proceeds at his own risk. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James Lee Knight, Notary Public, Guilford County, 58 N.C.A.G. 35 (1988).

                        Purpose of Section. - The object of this section was to prevent a judgment from being taken by default or by collusion, and to require the facts to be found by a jury. Campbell v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 413</cite>,
                        102 S.E. 737 (1920); Cobb v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 373, 256 S.E.2d 722 (1979).

                        The procedure in a divorce action is not the same as the procedure in other civil actions, in that the material facts in the complaint are deemed denied, whether actually denied by pleading or not, and in that no judgment shall be given in favor of the
                        plaintiff until such facts have been found by a jury (now a judge or jury). Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 186 S.E.2d 210 (1972).

                        Section Applies to Cross-Action. - This section is applicable to a defendant who files a cross-action and prays for a divorce therein from the plaintiff. Saunderson v. Saunderson, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 169</cite>, 141
                        S.E. 572 (1928).

                        Allegations in Counterclaim Deemed Denied in Divorce Case. - Despite the fact that the wife did not respond to allegations of marital misconduct and fault contained in the husband's counterclaim in the parties' divorce case, pursuant to
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-10ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-10(a)</a></cite>, all of the allegations of the counterclaim were deemed denied. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 238, 647 S.E.2d

                        Suits for Alimony Without Divorce. - Suits for alimony without divorce are within the analogy of divorce laws and within the purview of that portion of this section which controverts all material facts in every divorce action. Koob v. Koob,
                        <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 129</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 552 (1973).

                        applicable to other civil actions. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 186 S.E.2d 210 (1972).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Presumption of Denial - Generally. - The provisions of this section that the allegations of the complaint in an action for divorce "are deemed to be denied" applies only to the trial upon the merits, since the facts must be found by a jury (now a judge
                        or jury). Zimmerman v. Zimmerman, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 432</cite>, 18 S.E. 334 (1893).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The denial by the statute of the plaintiff's allegations in an action for divorce presumes, as a matter of law, a meritorious defense, and does not require that this be found by the judge in passing upon a motion to set aside a judgment rendered in an
                        action. Campbell v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 413</cite>, 102 S.E. 737 (1920).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Same - In Cross-Action. - The defendant in an action for divorce a vinculo, may file a cross-action for the same relief, and where no reply has been filed by the plaintiff, and no evidence has been offered by him, an issue is raised by this section, and
                        upon a verdict on the required issues, a judgment may be rendered upon the cross-action if the pleadings and the evidence are sufficient. Ellis v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 418</cite>, 130 S.E.
                        7 (1925).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All the allegations of defendant's counterclaim wherein he sought a divorce from bed and board were deemed to be denied by the plaintiff, even though she failed to answer the counterclaim. Skamarak v. Skamarak, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                        125, 343 S.E.2d 559 (1986).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Same - Time for Answering Not Affected. - The provision of this section putting in a denial of the plaintiff's allegations in an action for divorce did not affect the defendant's right to 20 days after completion of the service of summons by publication
                        in which to answer or demur, etc. Campbell v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 413</cite>, 102 S.E. 737 (1920).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Entry of Specific Denial by Defendant Not Prejudicial. - Since this section declares in effect that the material allegations of the complaint in a divorce action shall be deemed and treated as denied, it is inconsequential whether or not the defendant
                        enters a denial, and the entry of a specific denial by the defendant, under discretionary leave of the court, cannot prejudice the plaintiff. Walker v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 299</cite>,
                        77 S.E.2d 715 (1953).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Facts That Must Be Alleged Must Be Proved. - Under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-8" target="_self">G.S. 50-8</a></cite>, upon the basic principle that a plaintiff must prove what he must allege, a plaintiff
                        is entitled to a judgment of divorce only if the issues submitted and answered in favor of the plaintiff establish, inter alia, (1) the requisite facts as to residence, and (2) that (except where the alleged cause for divorce is
                        one year's separation) the facts set forth as grounds for divorce have existed to his or her knowledge for at least six months prior to the filing of the complaint. Pruett v. Pruett, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 13</cite>, 100
                        S.E.2d 296 (1957).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The allegations required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-8" target="_self">G.S. 50-8</a></cite> are indispensable constituent elements of a divorce action and must be established either by the verdict of a jury or by
                        a judge, as the pertinent statute may permit. Eudy v. Eudy, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 71</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 782 (1975), overruled on other grounds, Quick v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 446</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 653
                        (1982).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statutory changes eliminating the necessity for the filing of an affidavit and allowing a judge in some cases to become the trier of facts in divorce actions do not change the fundamental precepts that jurisdiction over the subject matter of divorce
                        is statutory and that all averments required by the statute must be both alleged in the complaint and found by the finder of fact to be true before a divorce judgment may be entered. Eudy v. Eudy,
                        <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 71</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 782 (1975), overruled on other grounds, Quick v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 446</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 653 (1982).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A divorce will be granted only after the facts establishing a statutory ground for divorce have been pleaded and actually proved. Adair v. Adair, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 303 S.E.2d 190, cert. denied,
                        <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 319</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 162 (1983).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Material Facts Must Be Found by Judge or Jury. - This section requires that, in a divorce action, the material facts as to the grounds for divorce must be found by a jury (now a judge or jury). Wicker v. Wicker, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 723</cite>,
                        122 S.E.2d 703 (1961).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The material facts in every complaint asking for a divorce are deemed to be denied under the statute, and no judgment is allowed to be given in favor of the plaintiff in any such complaint until all the material facts have been found by a jury. Skamarak
                        v. Skamarak, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 343 S.E.2d 559 (1986).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Required Findings. - The court erred in declaring the parties' divorce decree void where the divorce decree at issue was "in all respects regular on [its] face" and the defendant was properly served; the court's findings, required by this section, were
                        found under the heading "Conclusions of Law" rather than under "Findings of Fact." Dunevant v. Dunevant, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 542 S.E.2d 242 (2001).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Failure to Raise Genuine Issue of Material Fact. - The wife's answer generally denying the allegations of the husband's complaint for an absolute divorce was insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. Daniel v. Daniel,
                        <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 217, 510 S.E.2d 689 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Judgment Invalid Without Finding of Grounds. - Where judgment of divorce from bed and board contained absolutely no finding of the existence of any of the grounds for divorce from bed and board cognizable under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-7" target="_self">G.S. 50-7</a></cite>,
                        the district court was without power or authority, and therefore without jurisdiction, to enter it. Allred v. Tucci, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 354 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 166</cite>,
                        358 S.E.2d 47 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Order in Habeas Corpus Proceeding Is Not Res Judicata in Divorce Action. - It is patent that an order entered in a habeas corpus proceeding based on facts found by the trial judge is not res judicata in an action for divorce upon the ground of adultery.
                        Wicker v. Wicker, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 723</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 703 (1961).

                    <p>
                        Summary Judgment. - Under this section as it read prior to amendment in 1991, summary judgment could not be entered granting an absolute divorce in this State. Edwards v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 301,
                        256 S.E.2d 728 (1979).

                    <p>
                        In a case in which plaintiff, in her capacity as the personal representative of the estate of the decedent, sought to annul the decedent's marriage to defendant, arguing that the marriage was invalid because the officiant was not legally authorized to
                        perform a wedding ceremony in North Carolina, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to plaintiff because, under this statute, marriages in North Carolina could not be annulled at the summary judgment stage. Hill v.
                        Durrett, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 470 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Rendering of Default Judgment as Sanction in Annulment Action Improper. - Default judgment was incorrectly entered pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                        N.C. R. Civ. P. 37, due to a purported wife's failure to comply with the trial court's discovery orders in an annulment proceeding because a judgment for annulment could not be entered by default under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-10ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-10(a)</a></cite>,
                        which gave the trial court subject matter jurisdiction over the annulment action. Hawkins v. Hawkins, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 664 S.E.2d 616 (2008).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Decree by Consent, Stipulation, or Admissions. - This section itself raises issues in a divorce action as to all material facts, regardless of whether the parties by their pleadings have raised any issue and even where all material facts are admitted.
                        Thus, this section has the effect of prohibiting entry of a divorce decree by consent, stipulation, or admissions of the parties, and requires instead that all material facts be found, either by a jury where the right to a jury
                        trial has been preserved as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rules 38 and 39, or by the court where a jury trial has been
                        waived. Edwards v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 256 S.E.2d 728 (1979), decided prior to 1991 amendment.

                        Right to Jury Trial Preserved. - Where the defendant in apt time and manner demands a jury trial and does not thereafter waive but continues to assert her right to a jury trial, although it may seem futile for defendant to insist upon a trial by jury
                        when, but for this section, no real issue exists, this section gives her the right to do so, and it would be error for the trial court to deny her the right to have the facts found in a trial by jury. Edwards v. Edwards,
                        <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 256 S.E.2d 728 (1979).

                    <p>
                        1971 Amendment Did Not Nullify Right Conferred Prior to Amendment. - Where the last pleading was filed nearly six months prior to the 1971 amendment of this section, the amendment did not nullify the right to request a jury trial "prior to the call of
                        the action for trial" conferred by this section at the time defendant filed the last pleading. Branch v. Branch, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 133</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 671 (1972).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The substance of the 1973 amendment is very similar to that of the 1971 amendment. Laws v. Laws, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 206 S.E.2d 324 (1974).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 1973 amendment did not alter the procedure for securing a jury trial in actions for absolute divorce after a one-year separation where an answer had been filed at least 10 days prior to the effective date of the amendment. Laws v. Laws,
                        <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 206 S.E.2d 324 (1974).

                    <p>
                        Waiver of Jury Trial. - Defendant waived his right to trial by jury in an action for divorce on the ground of two years' (now one year's) separation when he failed to file a request therefor prior to the call of the action for trial, and the fact that
                        defendant had alleged a cross-action for divorce for adultery did not affect this result when defendant withdrew his cross-action before the case was called. Becker v. Becker, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 685</cite>,
                        138 S.E.2d 507 (1964), decided prior to the 1973 amendment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a suit for divorce on the grounds of separation, where defendant was personally served with summons, the judge, in the absence of a request for a jury trial filed prior to the call of the action for trial, had authority to hear the evidence, answer
                        the issues, and render judgment thereon. This rule applied equally to contested and uncontested divorce actions. Langley v. Langley, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 415</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 764 (1966), decided
                        prior to the 1973 amendment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A party may waive the right to a jury trial in civil actions by failure to follow the statutory procedure to preserve such right. Laws v. Laws, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 161 S.E.2d 40 (1968), decided prior to
                        the 1973 amendment.

                    <p>
                        Question for Jury. - Where the facts in a divorce action were in dispute, the case was one for the jury. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 80</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 492 (1945).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence in divorce action held insufficient to carry case to jury. Moody v. Moody, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 89</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 491 (1945).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Instruction Not at Variance with Section. - In an action for absolute divorce, a charge in reference to the admissions of counsel that the evidence was sufficient to support an affirmative answer to the issues of marriage, separation and residence was
                        not equivalent to a directed verdict and not at variance with the provisions of this section. Nelson v. Nelson, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 465</cite>, 149 S.E. 585 (1929).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Verdict of Jury. - In a proceeding for a divorce, the issues submitted and the verdict found should be as specific and certain as the facts alleged in the petition. Wood v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. 674</cite> (1845).
                        <br />

                        Cessation of Right to Support. - This section is declarative of the common law in that one of the rights which determines and ceases after a judgment of absolute divorce is the right to support. McCarley v. McCarley, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 109</cite>,

                        Power to Enter Alimony Order Ends upon Divorce. - When a party has secured an absolute divorce, it is beyond the power of the court thereafter to enter an order for alimony. Mitchell v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 253</cite>,
                        154 S.E.2d 71 (1967).

                    <p>
                        Wife's answer and counterclaim did not sufficiently preserve her claim for alimony, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-11(c)</a></cite>, after an absolute divorce was granted, when she requested
                        a certain monthly amount of alimony, because such a claim could arise on several alternative grounds requiring a trial court's consideration of at least 16 "relevant factors" in determining whether statutory grounds existed to
                        award alimony, and if so whether such an award was equitable under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A; so, under G.S. 1A-1-8(a)(1), an alimony pleading had to contain notice of
                        the grounds upon which this relief was sought, and as the wife's answer did not state such grounds, it was insufficient. Coleman v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 641 S.E.2d 332 (2007).

                        Jurisdiction. - Where the parties invoked the jurisdiction of the district court to equitably distribute their marital property in the action for absolute divorce and equitable distribution of their marital property, the district court did not lose jurisdiction
                        to equitably distribute the marital property because of its failure to enter a judgment in the equitable distribution case before the special proceeding seeking partition of the marital property was filed in the office of the clerk
                        of superior court. Garrison v. Garrison, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 369 S.E.2d 628 (1988).

        Jurisdiction Over Child Support.
       </b> - Where a North Carolina judgment of absolute divorce made no provision for child support, and there was thus no existing order, the Texas Attorney General's petition to establish a support obligation was properly classified
                        as a petition to establish an order of support rather than a petition to modify an order of no support; thus, under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the Texas trial court had the authority to adjudicate the father's child
                        support obligation, and because the North Carolina tribunal had not acquired continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, the trial court erred in granting the father's plea to the jurisdiction. Office of the AG of Tex. v. Long, 401 S.W.3d

                        Alimony May Be Awarded After Hearing on Remand. - If alimony is found to be appropriate after a hearing on remand, the ensuing judgment or decree awarding it will relate back to the time when the application for alimony should have been considered, which
                        is "before or at the time of the rendering of the judgment for absolute divorce." McCarley v. McCarley, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 109</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 490 (1976).

                        Decree of Absolute Divorce on Counterclaim to Action for Alimony as Interlocutory Judgment. - A decree of absolute divorce upon a counterclaim to an action for alimony without divorce was not a final judgment as to the remainder of the claims to be adjudicated
                        in the action. Instead, it was merely an interlocutory judgment, to become final upon a complete adjudication of all claims, rights and liabilities of the parties. It did not terminate or determine the remaining issues arising
                        from the pleadings in the action. Therefore, the court could amend, modify or rescind it at anytime prior to final judgment. Hamilton v. Hamilton, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 245 S.E.2d

                        Effect of Absolute Divorce on Prior Judgment for Alimony Without Divorce. - A judgment for absolute divorce awarded to the husband on the ground of two years' (now one year's) separation did not invalidate a judgment for alimony without divorce entered
                        in favor of the wife before the action for absolute divorce was instituted. Blankenship v. Blankenship, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 638</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 857 (1962).

                        Subsection (e) merely requires an equitable distribution claim to be asserted at any time prior to judgment, and does not prohibit a claim asserted before a divorce action is filed.

                        Trial court erred in granting a husband's motion to dismiss a wife's motion for equitable distribution, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20" target="_self">G.S. 50-20</a></cite>, in a divorce action where the
                        wife filed the motion on the day before the judgment was signed by the judge and filed, at which point the judgment became final pursuant to G.S. 1A-1-58; therefore, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 50-11(e)</a></cite>                        did not destroy the wife's right to seek equitable distribution as the motion was filed before an absolute divorce was granted. Santana v. Santana, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 614 S.E.2d 438 (2005).

                        Equitable Distribution After Judgment of Absolute Divorce. - Under this section, a judgment of absolute divorce destroys the right to equitable distribution unless the right is asserted prior to judgment of absolute divorce. Howell v. Howell,
                        <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 87</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 585 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a person entitled to equitable distribution does not specifically apply for it by cross-action or by a separate action prior to the judgment of absolute divorce, the divorce judgment destroys that person's statutory right to equitable distribution.
                        Lutz v. Lutz, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 399 S.E.2d 385 (1991), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 732</cite>, 404 S.E.2d 871 (1991).

                    <p>
                        If alimony and equitable distribution claims are properly asserted, whether by the filing of an action or raising of counterclaims, and are not voluntarily dismissed pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1) until after judgment of absolute divorce is entered, a new
                        action based on those claims may be filed within the one year period provided by the rule. Stegall v. Stegall, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 473</cite>, 444 S.E.2d 177 (1994).

                    <p>
                        Although subsection (e) requires that a claim for equitable distribution be brought prior to the granting of the divorce; where the trial court granted defendant relief from the judgment of absolute divorce and permitted defendant to file her answer,
                        the effect was the same as if the judgment had never been entered, and defendant's right to equitable distribution was revived. Baker v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 444 S.E.2d
                        478 (1994).

                    <p>
                        Wife sufficiently preserved her claim to an equitable distribution of marital property under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 50-11(e)</a></cite> when her answer to her husband's complaint for
                        divorce requested and reserved a right to equitable distribution, because the remedy of equitable distribution in a divorce case only applied to marital assets, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-21ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-21(a)</a></cite>                        gave a party asserting a claim for such redress 90 days to provide specific information about the property claimed to be subject to equitable distribution; so, to constitute a valid equitable distribution claim, the wife's counterclaim
                        for equitable distribution did not have to state that it applied to the parties' marital assets or property, and the husband was put on notice that the wife asked the court to equitably distribute the parties' marital and divisible
                        property. Coleman v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 641 S.E.2d 332 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In proceedings in which a former husband was granted an absolute divorce, the former wife was not entitled to compel an equitable distribution affidavit from the former husband because the wife failed to properly file her equitable distribution claim
                        pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-21ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-21(a)</a></cite> as a separate action, cross-action, or motion in the cause within six months after the husband dismissed
                        his own equitable distribution claim as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 50-11(e)</a></cite> and (f); an oral motion by the wife for such a claim did not constitute the required motion.

                        Wife could not appeal an order granting a husband's motion to vacate a judgment of absolute divorce to allow the husband to assert an equitable distribution claim because, inter alia, the wife did not show the order affected a substantial right as (1)
                        the husband was not collaterally estopped, based on <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 50-11(e)</a></cite>, from making an equitable distribution claim, since no such claim
                        had been adjudicated, so the order did not expose the wife to the risk of an inconsistent equitable distribution judgment, and (2) the wife did not show any representations the wife had made about the wife's marital status amounted
                        to a substantial right. Campbell v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 764 S.E.2d 630 (2014).

                        Trial court erred in granting defendant wife's motion to be "relieved of the effect" of a divorce judgment solely to the extent that the judgment barred her claim for equitable distribution. Howell v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 87</cite>,

                        Authority for Equitable Distribution. - Where neither party made application or stated a claim for equitable distribution prior to the judgment of absolute divorce, the trial court lacked the authority to enter such a judgment. Stirewalt v. Stirewalt,

                        Effect on Pending Action for Alimony Without Divorce. - Where, pending wife's action for alimony without divorce, husband obtained decree of absolute divorce on the ground of separation for the statutory period under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-6" target="_self">G.S. 50-6</a></cite>,
                        it was held that the final judgment in her action would be rendered after absolute divorce, and that she therefore would not be entitled to permanent alimony in her action, since under the common law she would not be entitled to
                        alimony after a divorce a vinculo, and that the saving provisions of this section would not be applicable. Yow v. Yow, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 79</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 867 (1955), decided prior to 1991 amendment.

                        Effect of Divorce Granted on Counterclaim to Pending Action for Alimony. - A decree of absolute divorce, granted to the defendant in a prior separate hearing on his counterclaim to an action for alimony without divorce, could not be pleaded as a bar to
                        the judgment awarding alimony in the subsequent hearing on the plaintiff's claim which initiated the action. Hamilton v. Hamilton, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 245 S.E.2d 399 (1978), aff'd,

                        Effect on Alimony Pendente Lite. - A dependent spouse's action for alimony without divorce was properly dismissed and order awarding alimony pendente lite was properly terminated on motion of the supporting spouse where he had been granted an absolute
                        divorce in an action instituted by him after the order for alimony pendente lite was entered. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 378, 183 S.E.2d 283 (1971), decided prior to 1991 amendment.

                        Where a judgment awarding the wife alimony pendente lite, to be continued until the award of permanent alimony, was rendered before rendition of judgment for absolute divorce, the rights provided for the wife by the prior judgment could not be impaired
                        or destroyed by the subsequently rendered decree of absolute divorce, and defendant remained liable to continue to make the payments under the alimony pendente lite order.

                        Absolute Defense Under Prior Law. - An alimony claim made pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a) and filed within one year of plaintiff's dismissal of her first claim

                        claim for alimony was distinct from that set out by the repealed section in that it deferred to the court's discretion on the decision of whether to award alimony where both the supporting and dependent spouse "each participated
                        in an act of illicit sexual behavior," whereas the old section foreclosed a dependent spouse from recovering; to allow her to maintain this new action would have deprived the defendant/husband of a statutory absolute defense he
                        had had under the old law. Brannock v. Brannock, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 635, 523 S.E.2d 110 (1999).

                        South Carolina Divorce Action Did Not Destroy Right to Equitable Distribution Under This Section. - Where neither party to a divorce action in South Carolina requested an adjudication of their property rights it necessarily followed that under the South
                        Carolina statute the court never acquired jurisdiction over their marital property and that the divorce judgment entered therein did not destroy plaintiff 's right to an equitable distribution of their marital property under this
                        section. Cooper v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 665, 369 S.E.2d 630 (1988).

                        Asserting Claim to Property Was Not Notice of Equitable Distribution. - In divorce case, defendant's answer asserting a claim to an interest in a specific piece of property, or to proceeds in plaintiff's possession flowing from defendant's interest in
                        that piece of property, was not sufficient to put plaintiff on notice that he was asserting a claim for equitable distribution under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20" target="_self">G.S. 50-20</a></cite>.
                        Goodwin v. Zeydel, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 387 S.E.2d 57 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Trial court had no authority to reaffirm divorce decree and reserve for future resolution the issue of equitable distribution where the trial court did not set aside the divorce but rather attempted to nullify the consequences of defendant's failure to
                        assert her claim for equitable distribution prior to the entry of judgment of divorce. Even if the court had effectively set aside, briefly, the divorce decree itself and then immediately reinstated the divorce decree with a reservation
                        of an equitable distribution claim, the reservation of the equitable distribution claim would have been a legal nullity because plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his equitable distribution claim and defendant did not, during the
                        time the divorce was arguably set aside, file an answer, counterclaim, or separate action requesting equitable distribution. Carter v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 440, 402 S.E.2d 469

                        Waiver of Equitable Distribution Induced by Misrepresentations of Other Party. - Defendant would be estopped from asserting the defense that plaintiff did not preserve her equitable distribution claim if plaintiff, in good faith, relied on the misrepresentations
                        of the defendant in waiving her right to equitable distribution. Harroff v. Harroff, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 398 S.E.2d 340 (1990), discretionary review denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 330</cite>,

                        Divorce Decree Containing Provision Reserving Equitable Distribution Issue. - Where decree for absolute divorce contained a provision reserving the issue of equitable distribution for hearing at a later date, trial judge, with whom plaintiff thereafter
                        filed a motion to dismiss defendant's claim for equitable distribution pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, had no authority to find error and reverse or vacate divorce judge's order reserving the issue. Stone v. Stone,

                        Rights Under Consent Judgment as Contractual. - Insofar as consent judgment imposed a duty of support on defendant-husband beyond that imposed by the common law or by statute, plaintiff-wife's rights did not arise out of the marriage, but out of contract.

                        Consent Judgment Held Not Affected. - Where a consent judgment for alimony without divorce had been entered, a condition of which was that the wife would remain unmarried, the subsequent decreeing of a divorce a vinculo to the wife was not a violation
                        of the terms of the consent judgment, and the judge had no authority to reduce the amount of alimony provided in the consent judgment upon that ground. Lentz v. Lentz, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 742</cite>,

                        Contractual Right to Continued Support Under Separation Agreement. - A separation agreement by which the husband agrees to support his wife even after a decree of divorce has been entered which, under this section, would otherwise terminate his obligation,
                        is nonetheless valid. In such a case, the wife's right to continued support does not arise out of the marriage, but arises out of contract and survives the judgment of absolute divorce. Haynes v. Haynes,

                        Claim for Arrearages in Payment Under Predivorce Separation Agreement. - Plaintiff's claim for arrearages in payments under a predivorce separation agreement was based on a right arising out of contract, which survived a judgment of absolute divorce,
                        and was not a right arising out of marriage which was terminated by a judgment of absolute divorce. McKnight v. McKnight, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 212 S.E.2d 902, cert. denied,

                        Counsel Fees for Enforcement of Subsistence Pendente Lite. - Since a wife's right to receive subsistence pendente lite is not destroyed by a judgment of absolute divorce, where her action for alimony without divorce is still pending, it would seem that
                        the proviso in this section is broad enough to include counsel fees to the wife to enforce the payment to her of subsistence pendente lite in arrears, for without counsel her right to enforce such payments might be impaired or
                        destroyed. Yow v. Yow, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 79</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 867 (1955).

                        Divorce Does Not Annul or Revoke Insurance Beneficiary Designation. - Neither this section, which provides that "all rights arising out of the marriage shall cease and determine," nor <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html#t31Aa01s31A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 31A-1</a></cite>,
                        which bars rights to "any rights or interests in the property of the other spouse," discloses a legislative intent that divorce should annul or revoke the beneficiary designation in a garden-variety insurance certificate. DeVane

                        estopped from relying on subsection (e) of this section, where, although the trial court specifically reserved the issue of equitable distribution for the future in its judgment of absolute divorce, the wife had not, and the husband

        Jurisdiction.
       </b> - Where a North Carolina judgment of absolute divorce made no provision for child support, and there was thus no existing order, the Texas Attorney General's petition to establish a support obligation was properly classified
                        as a petition to establish an order of support rather than a petition to modify an order of no support; thus, under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the Texas trial court had the authority to adjudicate the father's child
                        support obligation, and because the North Carolina tribunal had not acquired continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, the trial court erred in granting the father's plea to the jurisdiction. Office of the AG of Tex. v. Long, 401 S.W.3d

                        Legislative Intent. - By the enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1</a></cite> et seq., the legislature has sought to eliminate conflicting and inconsistent statutes which have caused
                        pitfalls for litigants, and to bring all of the statutes relating to child custody and support together into one act. In re Holt, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 108, 160 S.E.2d 90 (1968); In re King, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite>                        466, 165 S.E.2d 60 (1969); Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C.

                        Construction With Other Sections. - Subsection 7A-289.33(1) [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba11s7B-1112" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-1112(1)</a></cite>] is an exception to the general grant of standing
                        to seek custody under subsection (a) of this section. Krauss v. Wayne County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 371</cite>, 493 S.E.2d 428 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Trial court, in a custody case involving the son where reunification with a parent was the original goal and the county social services agency had obtained legal custody of him while awaiting a permanent disposition, did not enter a proper civil child-custody
                        order pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba09s7B-911" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-911</a></cite>. It made no findings of fact regarding its decision to transfer the son's juvenile
                        case pursuant to "Chapter 50," <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1</a></cite>, and to terminate its jurisdiction. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 677 S.E.2d 532 (2009).

                        This and the following sections do not alter basic legal principles concerning custody. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 174 S.E.2d 135 (1970).

                        Broad Application of Section. - Had the legislature intended this section to apply to only those custody disputes involved in a divorce or separation, it would have expressly so provided; therefore, the mere fact that it is found in the chapter of the
                        General Statutes governing divorce and alimony is not sufficient to cause its application to be restricted to custody disputes involved in separation or divorce. Oxendine v. Catawba County Dep't of Social Servs.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 370 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Consideration of Prior Orders. - The trial court did not err in considering temporary custody orders and prior contempt orders in determining the issue of child custody. Raynor v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite>                        724, 478 S.E.2d 655 (1996).

                    <p>
                        This Section and G.S. 48-9.1 Distinguished. - When this section and G.S. 48-9.1 are construed together, it is apparent that this section was intended as a broad statute, covering a myriad of situations in which custody disputes are involved, while G.S.
                        48-9.1 is a narrow statute, applicable only to custody of a minor child surrendered by its natural parents pursuant to G.S. 48-9(a)(1). Oxendine v. Catawba County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>,
                        281 S.E.2d 370 (1981).

                        G.S. 48-9.1(1) as Exception to Grant of Standing in This Section. - G.S. 48-9.1(1) was intended as an exception to the general grant of standing to contest custody set forth in this section. Oxendine v. Catawba County Dep't of Social Servs.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 370 (1981).

                        Court Declined to exercise Jurisdiction in Custody Action While Adoption Proceeding Pending by Holding Custody Action in Abeyance. - Where an adoption proceeding was filed before the child's father filed an action for custody, in order to avoid unresolvable
                        conflicts, the trial court had to decline to exercise its jurisdiction in the custody action while the adoption proceeding was pending by holding the custody action in abeyance. Johns v. Welker, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite>                        177, 744 S.E.2d 486 (2013).

                        <b>
        No Jurisdiction Over Custody.
       </b> - Child custody action was not pending when a neglect proceeding was initiated because as the juvenile court obtained jurisdiction over the children, the juvenile court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction unless jurisdiction
                        was terminated by order of the court; at the time the father filed the civil custody action, the trial court had no jurisdiction over the child custody action because of the already pending neglect proceeding. McMillan v. McMillan,
                        - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 692 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subject Matter Jurisdiction. - Trial court erred in dismissing a father's action for custody of his son, as it did not lack subject matter jurisdiction due to a prior pending adoption proceeding involving the son; the "prior pending action" doctrine did
                        not apply, as the parties were not the same in both actions and they did not request the same relief. Johns v. Welker, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 177, 744 S.E.2d 486 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court properly dismissed a grandfather's complaint for custody of his maternal grandchild because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to proceed due to a pre-existing child custody action between the child's paternal grandparents and the child's
                        now-deceased mother, which did not abate for reasons of constitutional and statutory law and, and, while any relative could seek custody of a child, the grandfather did not file suit against an allegedly unfit parent, and as his
                        complaint was more akin to a request to modify the custody order than it was an initial claim for custody, the proper procedure for the grandfather was to file a motion to intervene and a motion for custody in the grandparents'
                        custody action. Rivera v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 652, 824 S.E.2d 164 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Rights of Parents. - Absent a finding that parents (i) are unfit or (ii) have neglected the welfare of their children, the constitutionally-protected paramount right of parents to custody, care, and control of their children must prevail. Petersen v.
                        Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 397</cite>, 445 S.E.2d 901 (1994).

                    <p>
                        Rights of Parents Following Termination for Neglect. - Plaintiff did not have standing to seek custody of his biological children as an "other" person under subsection (a) of this section where his parental rights were previously terminated for neglect.
                        Krauss v. Wayne County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 371</cite>, 493 S.E.2d 428 (1997).

                        Rights of Presumed Parents. - Where there was no evidence another man had either been adjudicated the father of the child or acknowledged paternity, the marital presumption, that plaintiff was the natural father of the child, had not been rebutted and

                        Former domestic partner's allegations that she was an "other person" who had standing to seek custody were sufficient under Ellison to support a trial court's denial of a biological mother's motion to dismiss the partner's petition for custody. The partner
                        established standing under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1</a></cite> by alleging that she and the mother: (1) jointly raised the child; (2) entered into a parenting
                        agreement in which they each acknowledged that the partner was a de facto parent; (3) the partner had formed a psychological parenting relationship with the child; and (4) the child had lived all his life enjoying the equal participation

                        Trial court properly dismissed a former partner's complaint seeking custody of a minor child for lack of standing where although the former partner had a parent-child relationship with the children during her relationship with the mother, that relationship
                        ended when she evicted them from the residence, that fact defeated her standing as an other person under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1</a></cite>, and because she
                        never alleged that either biological parent was unfit or had abandoned or neglected the children, she failed to overcome the presumption that they had superior rights.

                        because (1) the aunt and uncle were the child's relatives, and (2) the child's mother acted in a manner inconsistent with the mother's paramount interest in the child's custody by placing the child with other parties and by acknowledging
                        the mother's substance abuse problems. Yurek v. Shaffer, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 67, 678 S.E.2d 738 (2009).

                        Grandparents lacked standing to bring a claim for visitation because there was no ongoing custody proceeding, as the mother had a natural and legal right to custody and control of the child upon the father's death and the child had not been adopted by

                        Visitation Action Qualifies As Custody Action for Attorney Fee Purposes. - Action by intervening grandparents for visitation qualifies as an action for custody, and if that action falls within the scope of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.6" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.6</a></cite>                        as an action for the custody, support, or both of a minor child for the purposes of awarding fees to the grandparents, then such an action must also fall within the scope of the statute for purposes of ordering the grandparents
                        to pay; an award of fees against grandparents seeking visitation rights was authorized. Sullivan v. Woody, - N.C. App. - , 843 S.E.2d 306 (2020).

                        Conclusion of law that it was in a child's best interest to grant legal custody to the child's father was supported by the findings of fact because the father's fitness and ability to provide proper care to and supervision of the child and the mother's
                        unfitness and inability to provide proper care for the child were uncontested as it was found: (1) that the father's visitation with the child had gone well; (2) that the child enjoyed a loving relationship with the father; (3)
                        that the father was the child's biological father; (4) that the father had not abrogated his constitutional rights to parent the child; and (5) that, even though the father testified that he did not want to disrupt the child's
                        situation by having the child live with him permanently, he also testified that he would take the child. In re H.S.F., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 739, 645 S.E.2d 383 (2007).

                        Trial court erred in granting a father sole authority to permit custodial time between the mother and the children where even though it found that visitation with the mother was not in the children's best interests, it had not found that the mother had
                        forfeited her parental rights, and thus, it could not delegate its judicial authority to the father. Routten v. Routten, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 436, 822 S.E.2d 436 (2018), review denied,

                        obtained visitation rights via a permanent custody order; thus, the termination of the mother's parental rights did not extinguish the grandmother's court-ordered visitation rights, and the grandmother could seek to enforce the

                        Grandparent Had No Rights to Proceed. - There are four statutes in North Carolina which permit a grandparent to maintain an action for custody or visitation of a minor child, and although plaintiff, mother of the deceased father of the two minor children,
                        did not specify under which statute she filed, it was clear that she had no right to proceed under this section, or <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(b1)</a></cite>,

                        Disatisfaction with defendant mother's husband, their standard of living, and the couple's residence did not provide plaintiff grandmother and her husband with an adequate claim upon which court could justify removal of grandchild from mother's custody;
                        plaintiff must allege facts which would support a finding that the defendant engaged in conduct inconsistent with her parental responsibility and/or constitutionally protected status. Penland v. Harris,

                        Grandparents, whose son was living separate and apart from his wife and children when he died in a highway accident, could not seek visitation with their grandchildren under this section because the children and their widowed mother constituted an "intact

                        The plaintiff/grandmother had no standing to seek visitation with her grandchildren under this section where the grandchildren, whose mother died in an automobile accident, and their father were an "intact family." Price v. Breedlove,

                        When grandparents initiate custody lawsuits under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1(a)</a></cite>, those grandparents are not required to prove the grandchild is not living in an intact
                        family in order to gain custody, instead, the grandparent must show that the parent is unfit or has taken action inconsistent with her parental status in order to gain custody of the child; the requirement to show unfitness if
                        a grandparent initiates a custody dispute is consistent with a parent's constitutionally protected right to the care, custody, and control of the child and protects the parent's right to control with whom his child associates on
                        a daily basis. Eakett v. Eakett, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 579 S.E.2d 486 (2003).

                        Intact family rule protects the parental right to determine with whom her children shall associate so a grandparent cannot initiate a lawsuit for visitation rights unless the child's family is already undergoing some strain on the family relationship,
                        such as an adoption or an ongoing custody battle; accordingly, the grandparent's rights to the care, custody and control of the child are not constitutionally protected while the parent's rights are protected. Eakett v. Eakett,

                        or where the minor child is in the custody of a stepparent or a relative - the "intact family" rule; in a case that does not involve adoption by a stepparent or other relative, a grandparent must prove that the child's family is
                        not intact before the grandparent can intervene to request visitation with his grandchild - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1(a)</a></cite>, 50-13.2(b1), 50-13.2A, 50-13.5(j) does not
                        grant grandparents the right to sue for visitation when no custody proceeding is ongoing and the minor children's family is intact. Eakett v. Eakett, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 579 S.E.2d 486 (2003).

                        As a grandmother failed to allege conduct sufficient to support a finding that the parents engaged in conduct inconsistent with their parental rights and responsibilities, she could not overcome the presumption that the parents had the superior right
                        to the care, custody, and control of the child, and lacked standing to intervene. Perdue v. Fuqua, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 673 S.E.2d 145 (2009).

                        Excluding Grandfather's Evidence in Support of Custody Motion Was Error. - The trial court erred in refusing to allow appellant paternal grandfather to offer evidence on the question of the best interest of the minor child in support of his motion for
                        custody. In re O'Neal, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 535 S.E.2d 620 (2000).

                        Award of Custody to Great Grandmother. - Termination of the aunt's parental rights and an award of permanent custody to the child's maternal great-grandmother was supported by substantial, competent evidence and affirmed, even though they had a pending
                        ch. 50 custody action, where evidence at the <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba09s7B-907" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-907</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>)
                        hearing indicated that the child's aunt, who had been awarded temporary custody, failed to: (1) comply with court orders, including drug testing; (2) make reasonable and timely progress towards permanency, including providing suitable
                        living conditions; (3) prove that it was possible for the child to return to her home within six months; and (4) prove it was in the child's best interests to live with her.

                        Portion of Order Retaining Jurisdiction Interlocutory. - Trial court's order retaining jurisdiction to determine custody is not a final determination of issue involved; rather it determines where children's custody issue will be heard, which is preliminary
                        to a final decree. The portion of the order retaining jurisdiction is interlocutory in nature. No substantial right of the defendant is affected which cannot be protected by the timely appeal from the trial court's ultimate disposition
                        of the entire controversy on the merits. Walleshauser v. Walleshauser, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 397 S.E.2d 371 (1990).

                        Civil Action to Obtain Custody of Illegitimate Child. - Under the 1949 amendment to former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13" target="_self">G.S. 50-13</a></cite>, either parent could institute a special proceeding to obtain

                        by the mother of an illegitimate child to obtain its custody from her aunt, with whom she had entrusted the child, and thus restricted the jurisdiction of the juvenile court in such instances. In re Cranford, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 91</cite>,

                        Relocation to Another State Held Proper. - Mother was properly permitted to relocate with the parties' three children to Minnesota under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1</a></cite> as: (1)
                        neither the father nor the mother had a support system in North Carolina; (2) the maternal grandmother could assist in supporting the children if the mother and the children moved back to Minnesota; (3) the mother had a job lined
                        up in Minnesota; (4) the advantages of relocation to the children outweighed the disadvantages, and relocation was in the children's best interests; and (5) the father's visitation rights had to be subordinated to the children's
                        best interests. O'Connor v. Zelinske, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 668 S.E.2d 615 (2008).

                        Interlocutory Order Not Appealable. - Because an order was best characterized as a temporary child custody order under G.S. ch. 50 rather than as a disposition order under G.S. ch. 7B, and was set for review in approximately four months, it was an interlocutory
                        order that did not affect any substantial right and was not appealable. In re N.T.S., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 731, 707 S.E.2d 651 (2011), review denied <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 203</cite>,

                        Guardianship Versus Custody. - When a stepmother was granted ex parte temporary custody of orphaned stepchildren, an aunt's subsequent guardianship petition made the custody action moot because, (1) in the guardianship case, the clerk properly exercised
                        jurisdiction, as the children had no natural guardian, and the clerk's jurisdiction was not divested by the ex parte temporary custody order, since the clerk considered other courts' custody awards, so the clerk had jurisdiction
                        to appoint the children's general guardians, an incident of which was physical custody, and (2) any guardianship modification, including custody modification, required filing a motion with the clerk instead of a district court
                        custody action. Corbett v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 40, 795 S.E.2d 564 (2016).

        Modification of Custody Order.
       </b> - Trial court did not err in granting a mother legal and primary physical custody because the court was permitted to make an initial child custody determination since the juvenile court in the neglect proceeding returned
                        custody to the parties; in the absence of an existing permanent child custody order, the trial court was not required to find or conclude that there existed a substantial change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the child

                        consideration of whether the child's best interest was or would be truly compromised by such deployment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section [subsection (f)], prohibits the court from using a parent's past deployment or possible future deployment itself as a negative factor in determining the best interests of the child. However, the significant effects on the child of the parent's
                        past or possible future service may be considered. The term "significant" is meant to exclude the court's considering trivial impact of a parent's deployment, such as the need to enroll a child in a different school. Under this
                        standard, the court may only consider impacts that are material or substantial. For example, the court may consider that the child has bonded closely with step-siblings while in a temporary custody arrangement during a deployment,
                        or that the child does not adjust well to new situations and therefore will likely have difficulty relocating if a parent is deployed in the future.

                            <span class="s1">

     Some of the cases cited below were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13" target="_self">G.S. 50-13</a></cite>, which prior to its repeal in 1967 dealt with custody and maintenance of children in actions for divorce.

                        <p>
                            Applicability. - The plain language of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(b)</a></cite> is referring to the party who is absent or has relocated with or without the children because
                            of an act of domestic violence; therefore, a mother's claim that the trial court violated <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(b)</a></cite> failed because that language did not apply
                            to the situation since the mother had not relocated due to an act of domestic violence, or, to the extent the language of the section could apply, it would apply to the father who had relocated to another country. Thus, the
                            trial court was required not to weigh the father's absence or relocation against him in determining custody or visitation. Jordao v. Jordao, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Visitation and child support rights are independent rights accruing primarily to the benefit of the minor child and one is not, and may not be made, contingent upon the other. Appert v. Appert, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                            27, 341 S.E.2d 342 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Jurisdiction. - When a divorce action is instituted, the court acquires jurisdiction over the children born to the marriage, and may hear and determine questions as to the custody and maintenance of the children both before and after final decree of divorce.
                            Crosby v. Crosby, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 235</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 77 (1967).

                        <p>
                            Custody Proceedings Are Continuing. - There is no requirement that each successive custody hearing starts with a "clean slate" and that the court cannot rely on the record previously generated. To the contrary, custody proceedings generally are continuing
                            in nature. Best v. Best, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 344 S.E.2d 363 (1986), overruled on other grounds, Petersen v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 397</cite>, 445 S.E.2d

                            A judgment awarding custody is based upon the conditions found to exist at the time it is entered. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 72</cite>, 145 S.E.2d 332 (1965).

                        <p>
                            Simultaneous Adoption and Custody Actions. - Because the legislature has enunciated a public policy that every child should have a permanent plan of care, because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent
                            plan of care and because the superior court has jurisdiction over adoptions, that court's jurisdiction supersedes that of the district court with regard to the custody of a child the subject of a simultaneous adoption and custody
                            proceeding. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329 (1995).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the absence of an order of consolidation when the same child is the subject of a simultaneous custody and adoption proceeding, both the superior and district courts do not have continuing jurisdiction to fully adjudicate the respective issues before
                            them. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329 (1995).
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Order requiring a custodial mother to move back to the county in which the parties had resided before separating to live in the marital home was set aside because, while the court could find the relative benefits of the children living with the father
                            in one county or the mother in another county when making a primary custody determination, the order was not a "related matter" the general assembly gave trial courts the authority to decide. Kanellos v. Kanellos,

                            Rights of Parents to Children's Records. - Trial court properly ordered that a mother share a child's school and medical records with the father, as <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(b)</a></cite>                            provided that each parent have equal access to the records of the minor child involving the health, education, and welfare of the child.

                            Denial to a noncustodial mother of access to the medical, educational, and counseling records of the mother's child was in error because the court's findings of fact did not support a conclusion that it was in the best interest of the child to prevent
                            the mother from accessing the records. While the mother's behavior at the child's school was disruptive, the findings did not indicate that the mother's behavior made third-party professionals sufficiently concerned about their
                            own safety, or have any other negative effect on the child. Paynich v. Vestal, - N.C. App. - , 837 S.E.2d 433 (2020).

                            The best interest and welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in determining the visitation rights, as well as in determining the right to custody, and neither of these rights should be permitted to jeopardize the best interest and welfare
                            of the child. In re Stancil, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 179 S.E.2d 844 (1971).

                            Although at one time under the common law the father was generally entitled to the custody of minor children, the courts at the present time almost invariably adhere to the principle that the welfare or best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.
                            This was the rule adhered to by North Carolina courts for many years, and is now prescribed by this section. Brooks v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 184 S.E.2d 417 (1971).

                            The primary consideration in custody cases is the welfare of the child or children involved. Rothman v. Rothman, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 401, 170 S.E.2d 140 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An order for custody of a minor child cannot be affirmed without a clear indication that it rested on a determination of what would be in the child's best interest. That is the paramount consideration in custody cases. In re DiMatteo,

                            This section expresses the policy of the State that the best interest and welfare of the child is the paramount and controlling factor to guide the judge in determining the custody of a child. In re Stancil, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            545, 179 S.E.2d 844 (1971).

                            As the Determining Factor. - The children of the marriage become the wards of the court, and their welfare is the determining factor in custody proceedings. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 72</cite>, 145
                            S.E.2d 332 (1965); Greer v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 167 S.E.2d 782 (1969).

                        <p>
                            The welfare of the children is the determining factor in custody proceedings, and an award of custody based on that factor will be upheld when supported by competent evidence. In re Poole, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite>                            25, 173 S.E.2d 545 (1970).

                            And the Guiding Principle. - The guiding principle to be used by the court in a custody hearing is the welfare of the children involved. While this guiding principle is clear, decision in particular cases is often difficult, and necessarily a wide discretion
                            is vested in the trial judge. He has the opportunity to see the parties in person and to hear the witnesses, and his decision ought not to be upset on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. Greer v. Greer,
                            <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 167 S.E.2d 782 (1969); Brooks v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 184 S.E.2d 417 (1971); Falls v. Falls, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 203, 278

                        <p>
                            The trial court should primarily be concerned with the welfare of the child in deciding which party before it should be charged with the enormous responsibilities of custodianship of the child. In re Kowalzek, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite>                            364, 246 S.E.2d 45, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 734</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 863 (1978).

                        <p>
                            In a custody proceeding, it is not the function of the court to punish or reward a parent by withholding or awarding custody of minor children; the function of the court in such a proceeding is to diligently seek to act for the best interests and welfare
                            of the minor child. In re McCraw Children, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 165 S.E.2d 1 (1969).

                        <p>
                            The best interest of the child is the overriding factor in custody determinations. Wilson v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 256 S.E.2d 516 (1979).

                        <p>
                            Joint custody and any other custody award must include findings of fact which support such determination of child's best interests. Witherow v. Witherow, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 392 S.E.2d 627 (1990).

                            Considered in Light of All Surrounding Circumstances. - The best interest of the child, in light of all the surrounding circumstances, is the paramount consideration which must guide the court in awarding custody of a minor child. Campbell v. Campbell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 304 S.E.2d 262, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 460</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 362 (1983).

                            Tender Years Presumption Abolished. - Trial court erred in entering a custody order concerning the parties' child; the trial court improperly relied on the tender years presumption in granting custody to the mother, as that presumption had been abolished,
                            and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(a)</a></cite> required that the custody decision be based solely on the best interests of the child, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>,
                            Rule 201(b) did not allow the trial court to take judicial notice of the assumptions underlying an abolished doctrine in order to resurrect the doctrine. Greer v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 624 S.E.2d
                            423 (2006).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court did not apply tender years presumption in awarding a mother primary physical and legal custody of the parties' child because there was nothing in the record to suggest the trial court relied on a psychologist's affidavit or the mother's testimony
                            regarding a "special bond" in awarding the mother custody, and, in fact, the trial court specifically noted the child was securely bonded to the father. Dixon v. Gordon, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite>                            365, 734 S.E.2d 299 (2012), review denied, 743 S.E.2d 191, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 552 (2013).

                            The trial judge is entrusted by this section with the delicate and difficult task of choosing an environment which will, in his judgment, best encourage full development of the child's physical, mental, emotional, moral and spiritual faculties. In re
                            Peal, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 640</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 664 (1982).

                            Any evidence of child abuse is of the utmost concern in determining whether the grant of custody to a particular party will best promote the interest and welfare of the child, and any evidence of such abuse must be resolved by the trial court in its findings
                            of fact. Dixon v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 73, 312 S.E.2d 669 (1984).

                            A natural parent's constitutionally protected paramount interest in the companionship, custody, care, and control of his or her child is a counterpart of the parental responsibilities the parent has assumed and is based on a presumption that he or she
                            will act in the best interest of the child. Price v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 68</cite>, 484 S.E.2d 528 (1997).

                            Acts of Domestic Violence Between Parties. - Trial court's best interests of the children determination under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(a)</a></cite> was supported by its findings
                            of fact, including its finding that the father had "body slammed" the mother 20 to 50 times during the marriage, and threatened to punch his brother-in-law in the nose. Hall v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite>                            527, 655 S.E.2d 901 (2008).

                        <p>
                            Although a mother voluntarily dismissed her domestic violence complaint at the time a memorandum of judgment was entered regarding custody, a trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the claim when the father filed a motion for modification
                            of custody, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7</a></cite>, because "acts of domestic violence between the parties" was one of the factors the trial
                            court was to consider, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(a)</a></cite>, when making findings as to the best interests of the child.

                        <p>
                            In a mother's suit for the issuance of a domestic violence protective order, it was error to deny an out of state father's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction based on a theory, adopted in other states, distinguishing between "affirmative"
                            and "prohibitive" orders because (1) that theory was not adopted, and (2) the father's substantial rights were implicated, as, inter alia, the issuance of such an order could affect the father's right to custody of the child.

                            Parents Have Legal Right to Custody of Their Children. - Parents, including the mother of an illegitimate child, have the legal right to have the custody of their children unless clear and cogent reasons exist for denying them this right. This right is
                            not absolute, and it may be interfered with or denied, but only for the most substantial and sufficient reasons, and is subject to judicial control only when the interest and welfare of the children clearly require it. In re

                            The mother of an illegitimate child is its natural guardian, and as such, has a legal right to its custody, care and control, if she is a suitable person, even though others may offer more material advantages in life for the child. But this rule is not
                            absolute, and the custody of an illegitimate child may be taken from the mother and placed elsewhere when it clearly and manifestly appears that the best interests and welfare of the child demand it. Wall v. Hardee,

                            Which Will Be Interfered with Only When Clearly Required. - Where one parent is dead, the surviving parent has a natural and legal right to custody and control of the parties' minor children. This right is not absolute, but it may be interfered with or
                            denied only for the most substantial and sufficient reasons, and is subject to judicial control only when the interests and welfare of the children clearly require it. Comer v. Comer, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite>                            324, 300 S.E.2d 457 (1983).

                            For Parent's Misconduct or Child's Welfare. - The law presumes that the best interests of a child will be served by committing it to the custody of a parent, when the parent is a suitable person; this presumption is not overcome merely by showing that
                            some third person can give the child better care and greater comforts and protection than the parent. A parent's right to custody of a child may be forfeited only by misconduct or by other facts which substantially affect the
                            child's welfare. In re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 188 S.E.2d 580 (1972).

                            But Child's Welfare Is the Paramount Consideration. - While the law presumes that the best interest of a child will be served by committing it to the custody of a parent, when the parent is a suitable person, the welfare of the child is the paramount
                            consideration to which all other factors, including common-law preferential rights of the parents, must be deferred or subordinated. Plemmons v. Stiles, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite>                            341, 309 S.E.2d 504 (1983).

                            Parent's Love Must Yield to Child's Best Interests. - The child's welfare is the paramount consideration, and a parent's love must yield to another if, after judicial investigation, it is found that the best interest of the child is subserved thereby.
                            Greer v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 167 S.E.2d 782 (1969).

                            The "paramount consideration" and "polar star" which have long governed and guided the discretion of the trial judges are the welfare and needs of the child, not the persons seeking his or her custody, and even parental love must yield to the promotion
                            of those higher interests. In re Peal, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 640</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 664 (1982).

                            The natural parent is presumed to be the appropriate custodian of his or her child, as opposed to third persons, and should not be deprived of custody merely because the child could be better cared for in a material sense. In re Kowalzek,

                            But This Presumption May Be Rebutted. - While it is presumed that it is in the child's best interest to be placed with a natural parent, this presumption may be rebutted by a circumstance which would substantially affect the child. Wilson v. Williams,
                            <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 256 S.E.2d 516 (1979).

                        <p>
                            The primary concern of the trial court in a custody matter, as mandated by subsection (a) of this section, is the welfare of the child, and this concern outweighs the presumption favoring the award of custody to a natural parent. In re Gwaltney,
                            <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 315 S.E.2d 750 (1984).

                        <p>
                            The presumption in favor of the natural parents is rebuttable. Best v. Best, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 344 S.E.2d 363 (1986), overruled on other grounds, Petersen v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 397</cite>,

                            Although there is a rebuttable presumption in favor of a natural parent, it is not necessary to prove unfitness in order to overcome the presumption. Black v. Glawson, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 442, 442 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            A court must award custody based only upon the best interest and welfare of the child. A court must have discretion to determine the best interest of a child, and should not be restricted to awarding custody to a natural parent in the absence of a finding
                            of unfitness. Black v. Glawson, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 442, 442 S.E.2d 79 (1994).

                            Custody May Be Granted to Third Person for Sufficient Reasons. - The welfare of the infants themselves is the polar star by which the courts are to be guided to a right conclusion, and therefore they may, within certain limits, exercise a sound discretion
                            for the benefit of the child, and in some cases will order it into the custody of a third person for good and sufficient reasons. Roberts v. Short, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 419, 169

                            A child's former care giver stated a claim as against the child's father for custody of the child, where the father's former companion alleged that the father had taken actions inconsistent with his protected status as a parent, including that the father
                            had placed the child in his parents' care and that they could not properly care for the child's diabetes, resulting in hospitalization and potentially serious and permanent health consequences, and that the father had relinquished
                            care of the child to others, including herself, on numerous occasions. Ellison v. Ramos, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 502 S.E.2d 891 (1998), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 356</cite>,

                            Fitness of Parent. - Mother's convictions for driving while intoxicated and child's developmental problems were significant and relevant to issue of mother's fitness as a parent because they indicated her inability to care for the child adequately and
                            to provide for the child's welfare; additionally, the facts that she had substance abuse problems, did not respect authority, was unable to recognize her child's developmental problems, and was incapable of caring for the child's
                            welfare supported the conclusion that she was an unfit parent. Raynor v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 478 S.E.2d 655 (1996).

                            The State failed to show that the father was unfit, as against the child's grandparents, to have custody of his child where he testified that if he were awarded custody of the child he would be willing to prohibit his brother, who was convicted for taking
                            indecent liberties with a minor, from staying at his house and interacting with the child; where his own convictions were too remote to affect his fitness or were unrelated thereto; where he already had considerable experience
                            in taking care of children; where his boss of 13 years and his volunteer supervisor, both described him as responsible, dependable, reliable and hardworking; and where he actively engaged in legal proceedings for approximately
                            two years, evidencing a long-term commitment to attaining custody. Adams v. Tessener, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 64, 539 S.E.2d 324 (2000).

                            Parent Need Not Be Found Unfit. - Although there is a traditional preference for biological parents, the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration to which all other factors, including common-law preferential rights of the parents must be deferred
                            or subordinated, and the trial judge's discretion is such that he is not required to find a natural parent unfit for custody as a prerequisite to awarding custody to a third person. Comer v. Comer,
                            <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 324, 300 S.E.2d 457 (1983).

                            While the fitness of a natural parent is of paramount significance in determining the best interests of the child in custody contests, it is not always determinative in itself. It is entirely possible that a natural parent may be a fit and proper person
                            to care for the child, but that all other circumstances dictate that the best interests of the child would be served by placing custody in a third party. In re Kowalzek, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite>                            364, 246 S.E.2d 45, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 734</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 863 (1978).

                            Fitness and Actions of Parent in Relationship with Domestic Partner Relevant. - While a district court could have concluded that the fitness of a child's biological mother warranted that she have sole custody, the district court was not required to do
                            so where evidence indicated that the mother had voluntarily relinquished her due process rights to solely make decisions in the child's life, intended that her former domestic partner become a de facto parent, and the partner
                            had established a significant bond with the child. Mason v. Dwinnell, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 660 S.E.2d 58 (2008).

                            Temporary Relinquishment of Custody. - There are circumstances where the responsibility of a parent to act in the best interest of his or her child would require a temporary relinquishment of custody; however, to preserve the constitutional protection
                            of parental interests in such a situation, the parent should notify the custodian upon relinquishment of custody that it is temporary and avoid conduct inconsistent with the protected parental interests. Price v. Howard,
                            <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 68</cite>, 484 S.E.2d 528 (1997).

                            In making custody decisions between a parent and a grandparent or other third party, the court must balance two doctrines. The first, the "parental right" doctrine, holds that ordinarily and in the absence of particular circumstances, the custody of a
                            child should be given to the parent in preference to the grandparent, if the parent is found to be fit to have custody and can supply a proper home. The second doctrine, the "best interests of the child" doctrine, holds that
                            custody should be awarded in accordance with the best interests of the child regardless of the fitness of the parents. Campbell v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 304 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            To Whom Custody May Be Awarded. - If the mother and the father are both fit and proper persons to have custody of children, under ordinary circumstances the court would then proceed to determine whether the best interest, health and welfare of the children
                            would be served by awarding custody to the mother or father. If not, then the court must deal with someone or an agency over whom the court has control. But an order awarding custody, in effect, to third persons who are not
                            parties to the proceeding, not a public institution, and not bound by the court's order, must be reversed. Boone v. Boone, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 174 S.E.2d 833 (1970).

                            Award of Custody to Grandparents. - Where the custody of a minor child was awarded to the mother in a divorce proceeding, and subsequently, both parents, who were deemed proper and fit persons to have the custody of such child, moved out of the State,
                            and the child was left by the mother with the child's maternal grandparents, residents of the State and highly proper persons to rear the child, upon petition of the father for custody of the child the court had authority under
                            this section to order that the child continue in the custody of the grandparents. Walker v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 751</cite>, 32 S.E.2d 318 (1944).

                            Where grandmother was a good housekeeper and showed the ability to care for the children the trial court erred in denying and dismissing grandmother's petition for custody on the basis of its "serious concerns" about her parenting skills because of problems
                            experienced by her daughter. Smith v. Alleghany County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 727, 443 S.E.2d 101, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 696</cite>,

                            Where there are unusual circumstances and the best interests of the child justify such action, the court may refuse to award custody to either the mother or father and instead award the custody of the child to its grandparents or others. In re Stancil,

                            in the context of an ongoing custody proceeding or where the minor child is in the custody of a stepparent or a relative - the "intact family" rule; in a case that does not involve adoption by a stepparent or other relative,
                            a grandparent must prove that the child's family is not intact before the grandparent can intervene to request visitation with his grandchild - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1(a)</a></cite>,

                            Domestic Partner Denied Custody, Parental Status, and Reinstatement of Visitation Schedule. - Trial court properly denied defendant's claims for joint custody, recognition of parental status, and reinstatement of the original visitation schedule because
                            plaintiff, defendant's former domestic partner, did not engage in conduct inconsistent with plaintiff's constitutionally protected status as the legal parent and did not allow defendant to function as a parent. Estroff v. Chatterjee,

                            Foster Parents Have No Standing to Bring Custody Action. - Nothing in the language of G.S. 48-9.1(1) gives foster parents standing to contest the department's or agency's exercise of its rights as legal custodian; therefore, foster parents are without
                            standing to bring an action seeking custody of minor child placed in their home by defendant. Oxendine v. Department of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 370 (1981);

                            It was improper for a trial court to apply a <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(a)</a></cite> best interest analysis to a domestic partner's application for joint custody without first

                            Claim for Custody Held Not Frivolous. - Where there was no indication at trial that the grandparents in fact did not wish to obtain custody of the children or that their claim was made in bad faith, the fact that the grandparents had originally asked
                            for visitation did not make their later claim for custody violative of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 11. Kerns v. Southern,

                            Remand Where Custody Awarded to One Who Was Not a Party. - While the court, upon proper findings and conclusions, may award the custody of a minor child to any such person, agency or institution as will best promote the interest and welfare of the child,
                            where the court awarded custody of the child to one who was not a party to the proceeding, the proceeding would be remanded with directions that the trial court issue the necessary notices and orders to make such individual
                            a party to the action, to the end that the court would have effective jurisdiction over her person. In re Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 608, 214 S.E.2d 215 (1975).

                            Reversal of Award to Third Party. - Where in an initial custody determination, the trial court conducted the "best interest and welfare" analysis, and based solely on that analysis, awarded custody of the minor child to defendant (friend of mother who
                            had cared for child since birth) rather than the plaintiff/father, the child's natural parent, the award of custody on this basis was error and must be reversed.

                            Conviction of Abandonment Did Not Preclude Award of Custody. - The fact that father had been convicted of abandonment of his children and ordered to provide for their support did not preclude the court from finding, upon a hearing of a subsequent motion
                            for the custody of the children in a divorce action, that father was a fit and suitable person to have custody of the children, when there was uncontradicted evidence upon the hearing that father had a good reputation in the

                            Effect of Prior Order of Incompetence. - In a controversy between husband and wife for custody of minor children of the marriage, it is error for the trial court to award custody to the husband on the sole ground that the wife has prior to that time been
                            judged mentally incompetent. A prior court order which judicially declares a parent to be incompetent is not sufficient in and of itself to establish a parent's present unfitness to have a child or children; rather, this section
                            requires a full, factual determination of all the circumstances in the case before a proper order may be entered by the court. Price v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 255 S.E.2d

                            Relevance of Evidence of Adultery. - The court committed prejudicial error in refusing to allow plaintiff to introduce evidence of defendant's adultery at a hearing on a custody motion. While evidence of adultery does not impel a finding of unfitness
                            of the adulterous parent, it is relevant upon an inquiry of fitness of a person for the purpose of awarding custody of minor children to him or to her. Darden v.

                            Joint Legal Custody Appropriate. - In addition to findings regarding parties' financial status and what would best serve interests of children, court had before it plaintiff's admission that she indeed thought defendant to be fit and proper person as
                            stated in her verified reply to defendant's answer and counterclaim. Thus, joint legal custody was appropriate. Witherow v. Witherow, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 392 S.E.2d 627

                            Joint Legal Authority. - Trial court erred in dividing decision-making responsibilities between the parties after awarding joint legal custody because the trial court had not made the necessary findings of fact to warrant a division of joint legal authority;
                            the trial court's mere findings that the parties had a tumultuous relationship did not satisfy the required findings. Hall v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 655 S.E.2d 901

                            The fact that mother's paramour had been living with mother and minor child since the parties' separation was insufficient, standing alone, to determine custody; the court must consider all the facts of the case and decide the issue in the best interests

                            the father was proper, even though the evidence would also have supported a finding that the child's mother was a fit and suitable person and that the best interests of the child would be served by awarding custody to her.

                            Age of Parents. - All else being equal, a 55-year-old person has a shorter remaining life span than a 33-year-old person and the consideration of continuity and stability in the life of a child will logically lead a judge to consider the age of a parent.
                            Consideration of all aspects of both parents' lives, including the potential for continuity and stability, is necessary to promote the governmental interest of granting custody on the best interests of the child. Phelps v.

                            A passing comment about a party's age, when determining a child's best interest in accordance with the statute, does not constitute an unconstitutional classification in violation of a party's equal protection rights. Phelps v. Phelps,

                            Award to Father on Finding of Changed Circumstances. - Trial judge did not abuse his discretion by ruling that a material change in circumstances had occurred with the increased age of younger child, who had been awarded previously to the mother, since
                            the child indicated clearly his desire to stay with his father, who also had custody of his elder brother. In re Peal, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 640</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 664 (1982).

                            Where father failed to offer evidence of mother's adultery at divorce trial, but after the divorce moved for a change of custody on that ground, the trial court's reassignment of custody of the child to father due to a material change of circumstances
                            since the date of the divorce was not erroneous merely because the crucial circumstances, e.g., the mother's adultery, existed before divorce. The child should not be placed in the custody of an unfit parent merely because
                            the other parent failed to introduce evidence at the proper stage of the litigation. Paschall v. Paschall, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 203 S.E.2d 337 (1974).

                            Award to Father on Condition That Physical Custody Be in Grandparents. - Where the court's conclusions that the mother was an unfit person to have custody of the children and that the father was a fit and suitable person to have their custody was supported
                            by the findings, but neither the father nor the paternal grandparents had a suitable home for the children, and that the maternal grandparents, with whom the children were then living, had such a home, an order awarding the
                            custody of the children to the father on condition that the physical custody of the children be vested in their maternal grandparents and that the father pay for their support would not be disturbed on appeal, the welfare of
                            the children being the determinative factor in the award of custody. Thomas v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 461</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 871 (1963).

                            Award of Custody to Father Held Proper. - Trial court did not err in concluding that it would be in the best interest of minor child for her custody to be placed with defendant father where, pursuant to separation agreement, plaintiff mother gave defendant
                            custody of the child and agreed to assist with medical and dental bills on behalf of the child; the child had lived with defendant at all times since her birth and lived solely with defendant since the parties' separation;
                            plaintiff rarely visited the child following the parties' separation; and plaintiff admitted that defendant had done a good job of looking after the child since their separation. Ingle v. Ingle,

                            Findings on Award of Custody to Mother Held Sufficient. - Findings that the parties had been married and divorced, that the wife was a person of good character, resident in this State, that the husband was financially responsible, and that the best interest
                            of the minor child of the marriage would be promoted by awarding its custody to the wife were sufficient to sustain a decree awarding its custody to her and requiring the husband to make contributions for the support of the
                            child. Hardee v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 40</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 884 (1949).

                            Award to Mother Upheld. - Where the trial court found, upon supporting evidence, that the mother was now a stable, fit, and suitable custodian of her children, and that their best interests required that their custody be awarded to her, the Supreme Court
                            would affirm the award of custody. Spence v. Durham, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 671</cite>, 198 S.E.2d 537 (1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 918, 94 S. Ct. 1417, 39 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1974).

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in modifying a custody order to grant joint legal custody to a mother and father with the mother having primary custody because there had been a substantial change in circumstances affecting the child and modification
                            was in the child's best interests pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(a)</a></cite>; father had moved out of state with the child, had facilitated
                            renewed contact with the child's maternal grandfather despite a court order prohibiting the contact, and the child had been harmed by a dog while in the father's care.

                            Trial court properly entered an initial custody order awarding primary and legal custody of the parties' child to one parent and supervised visitation to the other parent, until such time as the court was able to gather more evidence of the noncustodial's
                            parenting abilities. The trial court had authority to base its custody determination in part on its inability to determine the noncustodial parent's fitness as a parent, which was caused by the noncustodial's failure to answer
                            questions regarding allegations of child pornography. Meadows v. Meadows, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 782 S.E.2d 561 (2016).

                            Custody of Child Upheld Where Father Never Visited. - Where plaintiff mother had had de facto custody of five-year old child since his birth, and defendant, who had acknowledged paternity of the child when he was there, had not visited the child in a
                            substantial length of time, nor had he requested visitation privileges or custody, formal award of custody to mother would be upheld. Craig v. Kelley, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 458,

                            if the best interest of the child is served by placing the child in the father's custody, he is to be awarded custody of that child. Rosero v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 193</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 41 (2003), cert. denied,

                            applied the "best interest of the child" standard in awarding custody to the child's father, who had acknowledged his paternity under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.110.html#t110a09s110-132ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 110-132(a)</a></cite>,

                            In applying the best interest of the child standard to award joint custody of an illegitimate child to the parents, district court applied the correct standard as between the parents, because the common law presumption in favor of awarding custody of
                            the illegitimate child to the mother was abrogated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2</a></cite> and the case law. David v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite>                            89, 584 S.E.2d 102 (2003).

                            Court May Divide Custody Between Parents or Award General Custody Subject to Visitation Privileges. - The trial court has discretionary power either to divide custody between contending parents for alternating periods, or to award general custody to one
                            parent, subject to visitation privileges in favor of the unsuccessful parent. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 404</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 133 (1953).

                            Burden of Proof. - Grandparents seeking visitation rights had the burden of proving that the award of visitation was in the best interest of the children; therefore, where trial judge reversed the burden, so that the mother had to prove that the visitation
                            was bad for the children, the judge was in error. Kerns v. Southern, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 397 S.E.2d 651 (1990).

                            Findings as to Visitation. - To support an award of visitation rights, the judgment of the trial court should contain findings of fact which sustain the conclusion of law that the party is a fit person to visit the child and that such visitation rights
                            are in the best interest of the child. Montgomery v. Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 231 S.E.2d 26 (1977); In re Kowalzek, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 364,

                            a third-party professional could benefit the court in awarding specific visitation rights; therefore, there was no abuse of discretion in the court's ordering the consultation prior to its consideration of visitation rights.

                            parent has by conduct forfeited the right or unless the exercise of the right would be detrimental to the best interest and welfare of the child. In re Stancil, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            545, 179 S.E.2d 844 (1971).

                            Courts are generally reluctant to deny all visitation rights to the divorced parent of a child of tender age, but it is generally agreed that visitation rights should not be permitted to jeopardize a child's welfare. Swicegood v. Swicegood,

                            Determination of Visitation Rights May Not Be Delegated. - If the court finds that the parent has by conduct forfeited the right of visitation or if the court finds that the exercise of the right would be detrimental to the best interest and welfare of
                            the child, the court may, in its discretion, deny a parent the right of visitation with, or access to, his or her child; but the court may not delegate this authority to the custodian. In re Stancil,

                            Grandparents May Not Be Awarded Visitation Rights When Custody Is Not in Issue. - While subsection (b1) of this section authorizes the court to provide for the visitation rights of grandparents when the custody of minor children is being litigated, it
                            does not authorize the court to enter such an order when the custody of the children is not in issue. Moore v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 365 S.E.2d 662 (1988).

                            in the context of an ongoing custody proceeding or where the minor child is in the custody of a stepparent or a relative. McIntyre v. McIntyre, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 629</cite>, 461 S.E.2d 745 (1995).

                            Standing to Seek Grandparent Visitation. - Mother's motion to dismiss grandparents' motion for visitation was properly denied because, although the parents had entered into a consent judgment in the underlying child custody dispute, the custody of the
                            child was still "in issue" and "being litigated" by the parents when the grandparents moved to intervene, and thus, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(b1)</a></cite>,
                            the grandparents had standing to intervene at the time; the resolution of the custody dispute between the parents did not wipe out the grandparents' claim. Quesinberry v. Quesinberry, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite>                            118, 674 S.E.2d 775 (2009).

                        <p>
                            Grandparents lacked standing to bring a claim for visitation because there was no ongoing custody proceeding, as the mother had a natural and legal right to custody and control of the child upon the father's death and the child had not been adopted by
                            a stepparent or relative. Graham v. Jones, - N.C. App. - , 842 S.E.2d 153 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Paternal grandparents had statutory standing to seek permanent visitation rights, notwithstanding that the father had died, as they had been allowed to intervene when custody between the father and the mother was in dispute. Alexander v. Alexander, -

                            Grandparent Had No Rights to Proceed. - There are four statutes in North Carolina which permit a grandparent to maintain an action for custody or visitation of a minor child, and although plaintiff, mother of the deceased father of the two minor children,
                            did not specify under which statute she filed, it was clear that she had no right to proceed under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1(a)</a></cite>, this

                            Grandparents Had Right to Intervene in Pending Custody Action. - In a child custody action, the order granting intervention to the maternal grandparents on ground there was a pending matter regarding future visitation before the court was proper; because
                            the issue of the mother's visitation was still pending, the custody of the child was still "in issue" and was "being litigated" by the parents. Smith v. Barbour, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite>                            244, 671 S.E.2d 578 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 375</cite>, 678 S.E.2d 670 (2009).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in concluding a grandmother's visitation rights under a prior custody order did not survive termination of a mother's parental rights because the grandmother not only intervened in the case but also obtained visitation rights via a permanent
                            custody order; thus, the termination of the mother's parental rights did not extinguish the grandmother's court-ordered visitation rights, and the grandmother could seek to enforce the prior custody order through contempt proceedings.

                            Insufficient Findings to Support Order for Grandparent Visitation. - Remand of order granting grandparent visitation was necessary because the trial court made no explanation in its findings of fact as to why it determined that it was preferable to take
                            the majority of the grandparents' vacation visitation time out of mother's custodial time; moreover, it was unclear that the trial court considered the possible interaction between the parents' consent judgment and its order
                            awarding visitation to the grandparents. Quesinberry v. Quesinberry, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 674 S.E.2d 775 (2009).

                            Electronic Video Communication. - In proceedings wherein a five-year-old child was adjudicated neglected, the trial court erred in denying the mother in-person visitation and permitting only electronic video communication,

                            Visitation Rights to Parent In Foreign Country. - Trial court, when it awarded one parent in North Carolina the primary physical care and custody of the parties' minor child, properly awarded visitation privileges to the other parent, who was a citizen
                            and resident of Canada and a missionary in Malawi, because the court considered the factors relevant to the child's best interest, including the characteristics of the parties and the one parent's concerns about the possible
                            dangers to the child if the child were to travel to Malawi. Burger v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 776 S.E.2d 886 (2015).

                            Visitation Action Qualifies As Custody Action for Attorney Fee Purposes. - Action by intervening grandparents for visitation qualifies as an action for custody, and if that action falls within the scope of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.6" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.6</a></cite>                            as an action for the custody, support, or both of a minor child for the purposes of awarding fees to the grandparents, then such an action must also fall within the scope of the statute for purposes of ordering the grandparents
                            to pay; an award of fees against grandparents seeking visitation rights was authorized. Sullivan v. Woody, - N.C. App. - , 843 S.E.2d 306 (2020).

                            Wishes of Child of Sufficient Age Are Entitled to Weight. - The wishes of a child of sufficient age to exercise discretion in choosing a custodian are entitled to considerable weight when the contest is between the parents, but are not controlling. Hinkle

                            A child may be a competent witness and ought to be examined in that character. Indeed, being the party mainly concerned, he has a right to make a statement to the court as to his feelings and wishes upon the matter. This ought to be allowed serious consideration
                            by the court, in the exercise of its discretion. Kearns v. Kearns, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 170 S.E.2d 132 (1969), overruled on other grounds, Stephenson v. Stephenson,

                            In making the weighty choice of awarding custody, the judge may properly consider the preference or wishes of a child of suitable age and discretion. In re Peal, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 640</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 664 (1982).

                            Because Child's Wishes Will Aid Determination of His Best Interests. - The child's wishes will be one factor considered by the court in determining his custody, usually not because of any legal right in the child to have his wishes granted, but because
                            the consideration of such wishes will aid the court in making a custodial decree which is for the best interests and welfare of the child. Brooks v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite>                            626, 184 S.E.2d 417 (1971).

                        <p>
                            But Such Wishes Are Not Controlling. - When a child has reached the age of discretion, the court may consider the preference or wishes of the child to live with a particular person. A child has attained an age of discretion when it is of an age and capacity
                            to form an intelligent or rational view on the matter. The expressed wish of a child of discretion is, however, never controlling upon the court, since the court must yield in all cases to what it considers to be the child's
                            best interests, regardless of the child's personal preference. Hinkle v. Hinkle, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 189</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 73 (1966).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although the preference of a child of discretion would seem to have its greatest weight when the controversy is between the parents and both are fit persons, the child's wishes are only entitled to consideration and are not controlling. Brooks v. Brooks,
                            <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 184 S.E.2d 417 (1971).

                            Weight to Be Given Child's Testimony Is for the Court. - A child has a right to have his testimony heard. However, the weight to be attached to such testimony is within the discretion of the trial judge. Kearns v. Kearns,

                            Lack of Findings as to Child's Preferences Insufficient to Upset Award. - Failure of the court to include a finding as to the preferences of the minor child is insufficient to upset its order of award of custody. Brooks v. Brooks,
                            <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 184 S.E.2d 417 (1971).

                            Ten Year Old. - A child's preference as to who shall have his custody is not controlling; however, the trial judge should consider the wishes of a 10-year-old child in making his determination. In re Stancil, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            545, 179 S.E.2d 844 (1971).

                            Where the contest is between a parent and one not connected by blood to the child, the desire of the child will not ordinarily prevail over the natural right of the parent, unless essential to the child's welfare. In re Stancil,

                            Determining the custody of minor children is never the province of a jury; it is that of the judge of the court in which the proceeding is pending. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 497</cite>, 155 S.E.2d
                            221 (1967).

                            The question of custody is one addressed to the trial court. Hinkle v. Hinkle, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 189</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 73 (1966).

                            Trial Judge Is Vested with Broad Discretion. - The trial judge, who has the opportunity to see and hear the parties and the witnesses, is vested with broad discretion in cases involving custody of children. Blackley v. Blackley,

                            While the welfare of the child is always to be treated as the paramount consideration, wide discretionary power is necessarily vested in the trial court in reaching decisions in particular cases. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 404</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The trial judge is vested with broad discretion in child custody cases. The "paramount consideration" which limits this discretion is the welfare and needs of the children. Phillips v. Choplin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C.

                        <p>
                            The trial judge is vested with broad discretion in child custody cases, and that discretion must be exercised to serve the welfare and needs of the children. Woncik v. Woncik, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 244,

                            Judge's Decision Will Not Be Upset Absent Abuse. - The decision to award custody of a minor is vested in the discretion of the trial judge, who has the opportunity to see the parties in person and to hear the witnesses, and his decision ought not to be
                            upset on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. In re Pitts, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C.

                            Where trial judge enters a custody order that in his judgment is in the best interest of the child, the appellate division should not reverse that judgment and hold, as a matter of law, that the trial judge was obliged to have reached a different opinion,
                            in the absence of a clear showing of abuse of discretion. Decisions in custody cases are never easy, and the trial judge has the opportunity to see the parties in person and to hear the witnesses. He can detect tenors, tones
                            and flavors that are lost in the bare printed record read months later by appellate judges. Newsome v. Newsome, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 416, 256 S.E.2d 849 (1979).

                            If Supported by Competent Evidence. - The trial judge's decision as to custody will not be upset, in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion, if his findings are supported by competent evidence. Sheppard v. Sheppard,
                            <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 712, 248 S.E.2d 871 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 586</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 34 (1979); Comer v. Comer, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 324, 300 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            The question of custody is one addressed to the trial court, and the court's decision will be upheld if supported by competent evidence. Roberts v. Short, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 419, 169 S.E.2d 910 (1969);
                            Brandon v. Brandon, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 457, 179 S.E.2d 177 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trial judge is present where he can observe and hear the parties and their witnesses, and ordinarily his decision on custody will be upheld if supported by competent evidence. In re McCraw Children, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite>                            390, 165 S.E.2d 1 (1969).

                        <p>
                            Instead of applying an inflexible rule, the court must consider all facts of the case and decide the issue in accordance with the best interests of the child. Paschall v. Paschall, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite>                            120, 203 S.E.2d 337 (1974).

                            Discretion to Allow Grandparent's Visitation Rights. - Although the trial judge determined that the appellant-defendant would continue to have primary custody of the children, it was entirely within the trial judge's discretion to allow the grandparents'
                            visitation rights based on the best interest of the children. Kerns v. Southern, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 397 S.E.2d 651 (1990).

                            Nature of Evidence. - An order for custody should be entered only after the most careful consideration, and only after the court has had the benefit of more reliable evidence than is usually afforded by affidavits. In re Griffin,
                            <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 170 S.E.2d 84 (1969).

                        <p>
                            Discretion Not to Include A Provision. - Plaintiff provided no supporting guidance as to how or why the trial court was required to make certain findings and the issue was not addressed; moreover, as the trial court orally noted that it would not entertain
                            a parenting-time right of first refusal as being in the best interests of the minor children, it was within the discretion of the trial court to not include such a provision, either to its granting or denial, in the child custody

                            Trial Court Must Make Findings of Fact. - To support an award of custody, the judgment of the trial court should contain findings of fact which sustain the conclusion of law that custody of the child is awarded to the person who will best promote the
                            interest and welfare of the child. Montgomery v. Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 231 S.E.2d 26 (1977); Green v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 571, 284

                        <p>
                            The court erred in not permitting the parties to a "joint custody" agreement to present extrinsic evidence of the parties' understanding of the meaning of those terms and their intent at the time of the agreement before determining whether the plaintiff
                            wife had breached the agreement by failing to take steps to help the son who had drug abuse problems, thereby excusing the defendant husband from paying alimony. Patterson v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite>                            91, 535 S.E.2d 374 (2000).

                        <p>
                            Before awarding custody of a child to a particular party, the trial court must conclude as a matter of law that the award of custody to that particular party will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. Findings of fact as to the characteristics
                            of the competing parties must be made to support the necessary conclusion of law. These findings may concern physical, mental, or financial fitness or any other factors brought out in the evidence and relevant to the issue
                            of the welfare of the child. Steele v. Steele, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 244 S.E.2d 466 (1978).

                            To support an award of custody, the judgment of the trial court should contain findings of fact which sustain the conclusion of law that custody of the child is awarded to the person who will best promote the interest and welfare of the child; the conclusion
                            of law determinative of the custody is not, therefore, that the person gaining custody is a fit and proper person to have custody, but which party will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. Green v. Green,
                            <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 571, 284 S.E.2d 171 (1981).

                            Which Must Be More Than Mere Conclusory Statements. - A custody order is fatally defective where it fails to make detailed findings of fact from which an appellate court can determine that the order is in the best interest of the child, and custody orders
                            are routinely vacated where the findings of fact consist of mere conclusory statements that the party being awarded custody is a fit and proper person to have custody and that it will be in the best interests of the child to
                            award custody to that person. Dixon v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 73, 312 S.E.2d 669 (1984).

                            The trial court erred in amending the custody decree based on a finding of substantial change in circumstances where it found only that the proposed relocation of the mother after her remarriage would adversely affect the relationship between the father

                            from her father to her mother, there was no evidence in the record in a proceeding on the parties' cross-motions for contempt that supported the finding that transferring custody to the mother was in the child's best interests.
                            The court made only one finding, that the child missed the two people in her life who had neglected her, which was not a basis for not allowing custody to remain with the father, the trial court had a right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(a)</a></cite>                            to consider, but did not consider, acts of domestic violence by the child's stepfather toward her mother when determining the child's best interests, and the trial court had no right to take custody away from the father simply

                            Failure to Make Findings Is Error. - It is error for the court granting a decree of divorce to award the custody of a child without findings of fact from which it could be determined that the order was adequately supported by competent evidence and was

                            Trial court erred in granting permanent custody of a child to the child's natural parent, who had extremely limited contact with the child before the other parent's death, because it was speculative to assess what the quality of their relationship would
                            be after a four-month "get acquainted" period during which temporary custody had been granted to the child's grandparents. McRoy v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 381, 585 S.E.2d

                            The normal rule in regard to the custody of children is that where there is competent evidence to support a judge's finding of fact, a judgment supported by such findings will not be disturbed on appeal; however, the facts found must be adequate for the

                            at the time the memorandum of judgment was entered to make appropriate findings to provide a base line before it could determine if there had been a material change in circumstances, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7</a></cite>,
                            because the mother and father had waived findings of fact and conclusions of law at the time the memorandum of judgment by consent was entered. Balawejder v. Balawejder, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 721 S.E.2d

                            Nor Are Separation Agreements and Consent Judgments Based Thereon. - Valid separation agreements, including consent judgments based on such agreements with respect to marital rights, are not final and binding as to the custody of minor children or as
                            to the amount to be provided for the support and education of such minor children. Fuchs v. Fuchs, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 635</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 487 (1963); Hinkle v. Hinkle, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 189</cite>,

                            While the marital and property rights of the parties under the provisions of a valid separation agreement cannot be ignored or set aside by the court without the consent of the parties, such agreements are not final and binding as to the custody of minor
                            children or as to the amount to be provided for the support and education of such minor children. Soper v. Soper, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 95, 223 S.E.2d 560 (1976).

                            And Court Is Not Precluded Thereby from Acting Under This Section. - A deed of separation between husband and wife containing an agreement for the custody of their minor child does not preclude the court, upon granting a decree for absolute divorce in
                            a suit brought subsequent to the deed of separation, from awarding the custody of the child in accordance with this section. In re Albertson, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 742</cite>, 172 S.E. 411

                            The fact that petitioner agreed when separation took place between herself and her husband that the custody of their child should remain with the father was not binding on the court. Finley v. Sapp, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 114</cite>,

                            As no agreement between spouses will deprive the court of its inherent and statutory authority to protect the interests and provide for the welfare of infants. The parties may bind themselves by separate agreement or by a consent judgment, but they cannot
                            thus withdraw the children of the marriage from the protective custody of the court. State v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 11</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 822 (1942); Fuchs v. Fuchs, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 635</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Provisions in a deed of separation for support of the minor children of the marriage, entered as a consent judgment by the court, cannot deprive the court of its inherent and statutory authority to protect the interests and provide for the welfare of
                            the infants; therefore, judgment increasing the allowance for the minor children upon findings of a change of circumstances warranting such increase would be affirmed. Bishop v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 573</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The child is not a party to a separation agreement, and the parents cannot contract away the jurisdiction of the court, which is always alert in the discharge of its duty towards its wards, the children of the State whose personal property interests require
                            protection. State v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 11</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 822 (1942).

                        <p>
                            It is the court's duty to award custody in accordance with the best interests of the child, and no agreement, consent or condition between the parents can interfere with this duty or bind the court. Spence v. Durham,

                            And Parties Are Bound Thereby Until Court Orders Otherwise. - Where judgment by confession purported to grant custody of child to one party, this judgment did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction to determine custody, but the parties, having
                            agreed to it, were bound by its provisions until the court made some order for custody. Pierce v. Pierce, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 815, 295 S.E.2d 247 (1982).

                            Presumption as to Amount Mutually Agreed upon in Separation Agreement. - Where parties to a separation agreement agree upon the amount of the support and maintenance of their minor children, there is a presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
                            that the amount mutually agreed upon is just and reasonable, and upon motion for an increase in such allowance, a court is not warranted in ordering an increase in the absence of any evidence of a change of conditions. Soper

                            Party to Separation Agreement Not Precluded from Bringing Action. - When a case is properly before it, the court has the duty to award custody in accordance with the best interests of the child, and no agreement, consent or condition between the parents
                            can interfere with this duty or bind the court. Thus, the existence of a valid separation agreement containing provisions relating to the custody and support of minor children does not prevent one of the parties to the agreement
                            from instituting an action for a judicial determination of those same matters. Winborne v. Winborne, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 756, 255 S.E.2d 640, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 305</cite>,

                <p>
                    A biological grandparent may institute an action or proceeding for visitation rights with a child adopted by a stepparent or a relative of the child where a substantial relationship exists between the grandparent and the child. Under no circumstances
                    shall a biological grandparent of a child adopted by adoptive parents, neither of whom is related to the child and where parental rights of both biological parents have been terminated, be entitled to visitation rights. A court may
                    award visitation rights if it determines that visitation is in the best interest of the child. An order awarding visitation rights shall contain findings of fact which support the determination by the judge of the best interest of
                    the child. Procedure, venue, and jurisdiction shall be as in an action for custody.

                        Trial court did not err in allowing grandparents to intervene in adoption proceeding pursuant to this section without holding a preliminary evidentiary hearing to determine whether a substantial relationship existed between the movants and grandchildren,

                        Grandparent Had No Right to Proceed. - There are four statutes in North Carolina which permit a grandparent to maintain an action for custody or visitation of a minor child, and although plaintiff, mother of the deceased father of the two minor children,
                        did not specify under which statute she filed, it was clear that she had no right to proceed under G.S.G.S. 50-13.1(a), 50-13.2(b1), this section, or 50-13.5(j). Shaut v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite>                        834, 526 S.E.2d 214 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Grandparents lacked standing to bring a claim for visitation because there was no ongoing custody proceeding, as the mother had a natural and legal right to custody and control of the child upon the father's death and the child had not been adopted by

                        Standing to Bring Action Based on Substantial Relationship. - The grandmother had standing under this section to seek visitation rights with her grandchildren, where the children were adopted by their biological aunt and her husband, and the grandmother
                        had a substantial relationship with the children, in that she had helped raise them from birth and they had lived with her for eight months prior to the adoption. Hill v. Newman, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite>                        793, 509 S.E.2d 226 (1998).

                        arises either in the context of an ongoing custody proceeding or where the minor child is in the custody of a stepparent or a relative. McIntyre v. McIntyre, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 629</cite>, 461 S.E.2d 745 (1995).

                    <p>
                        There existed substantial change of circumstances when visitation rights of grandparents arbitrarily terminated by the natural mother when the grandparents had established a continuing substantial relationship with their grandchildren since the entry
                        of earlier custody order, and based upon that, the court found sufficient facts to justify its conclusion that it was in the best interest of the grandchildren to maintain a continuing relationship with the grandparents through
                        the granting of visitation privileges. Hedrick v. Hedrick, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 368 S.E.2d 14, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 173</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 108 (1988).

                        Where adoption of two grandchildren by stepfather not finalized until one month after the entry of the judgment awarding grandparents visitation, whatever rights he was to gain in becoming an adoptive parent had not vested at the time of the hearing,
                        and therefore the adjudication of the issues before the court did not require his presence in the suit. Hedrick v. Hedrick, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 368 S.E.2d 14, cert. denied,

                        Jurisdiction. - Under North Carolina case law, matters of custody, which include visitation rights under this section, are pending until the death of one of the parties or until the child reaches the age of majority. The hands of the courts would be effectively
                        tied if they had no jurisdiction to enforce the orders they enter. Beck v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 306 S.E.2d 580 (1983).

                        Case Law Not Overruled. - Adoption of the provision in the statute to allow a trial court to enforce custody orders pursuant to its contempt powers did not overrule certain case law; it simply created a new, specific, and limited right. Quevedo-Woolf
                        v. Overholser, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 820 S.E.2d 817 (2018), appeal dismissed, review denied, stay denied,

                        Only Willful Disobedience May Be Punished. - A failure to obey an order of a court cannot be punished by contempt proceedings unless the disobedience is willful, which imports knowledge and a stubborn resistance. Cox v. Cox,
                        <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Trial Court Must Find Defendant Possessed Means to Comply. - In order to punish by contempt proceedings, the trial court must find as a fact that the defendant possessed the means to comply with orders of the court during the period when he was in default.
                        Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                        One does not act willfully in failing to comply with a judgment if it has not been within his power to do so since the judgment was rendered. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Finding as to Present Ability to Comply. - In a contempt proceeding for violation of a custody order, no specific finding was required of the trial court as to the defendant's present ability to comply with the order, although there was in fact plenary
                        evidence introduced to justify such a finding. Lee v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 371, 246 S.E.2d 49 (1978).

                        Where the court enters judgment as for civil contempt, the court must not only find failure to comply with the order, but must also find that the defendant presently possesses the means to comply. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                        476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                        Appealability of Contempt Order Where Punishment Is Withheld. - Plaintiff was entitled to appeal the order of the trial court finding that she was in contempt of child custody orders, even though the trial court withheld punishment and only made the findings
                        a part of the record, since to withhold punishment without further limitation is to retain the right to impose it in the future. Under such circumstances, the order holding the plaintiff in contempt affected a substantial right
                        and was therefore appealable. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 554</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 129 (1978).

                        Review of Findings of Fact. - In proceedings for contempt, the facts found by the judge are not reviewable except for the purpose of passing upon their sufficiency to warrant the judgment. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                        476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                    <p>
                        In contempt proceedings, the judge's findings of fact are conclusive on appeal when supported by any competent evidence and are reviewable only for the purpose of passing on their sufficiency to warrant the judgment. Clark v. Clark,
                        <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 554</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 129 (1978).

                        Review in contempt proceedings is limited to whether there is competent evidence to support findings of fact and whether findings support conclusions of law. Walleshauser v. Walleshauser, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite>                        594, 397 S.E.2d 371 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Payment of Counsel Fees. - The court is vested with broad power when it is authorized to punish "as for contempt." This power includes the authority for a district court judge to require one whom he has found in willful contempt of court for failure to
                        comply with a child support order entered pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1</a></cite> et seq., to pay reasonable counsel fees to opposing counsel as a
                        condition to being purged of contempt. Blair v. Blair, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 173 S.E.2d 513 (1970).

                    <p>
                        Visitation and child support rights are independent rights accruing primarily to the benefit of the minor child and one is not, and may not be made, contingent upon the other. Appert v. Appert, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                        27, 341 S.E.2d 342 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Receipt of Support May Not Be Conditioned on Visitation. - A trial judge does not have authority to condition a minor child's receipt of support paid by the noncustodial parent on compliance with court-ordered visitation allowed the noncustodial parent
                        by ordering that child support paid by defendant be placed in escrow if minor child fails or refuses to abide by the visitation privileges allowed defendant. Appert v. Appert, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                        27, 341 S.E.2d 342 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Enforcement of Visitation Orders. - Trial judges in this State have authority to enforce orders providing for visitation by the methods set forth in this section, that is, by contempt proceedings and by injunction. Appert v. Appert,
                        <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 27, 341 S.E.2d 342 (1986).

                    <p>
                        No Authority to Modify Father's Visitation Rights. - The trial court was without authority to transform a show cause hearing on the matter of a wife's alleged contempt in failing to comply with a custody order, on its own motion and without notice to
                        the wife, into a hearing on the issue of modification of the father's visitation rights as set forth in prior orders. Lee v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 371, 246 S.E.2d 49 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Finding of Contempt Supported by Competent Evidence. - Where competent evidence supported trial court's findings of defendant's failure to comply with previous visitation order and of his present ability to comply with the order, these findings were conclusive
                        on appeal and also supported conclusion of law that defendant was in contempt of visitation order. Walleshauser v. Walleshauser, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 397 S.E.2d 371 (1990).

                        No Finding of Contempt as Actions in Violation of Visitation Order Were Justified. - Trial court's finding that the mother's actions, suspending the father's visitation over his objection and without court authority, did not amount to contempt was upheld,
                        as there was evidence that the mother's failure to comply with the visitation order was justified after the father physically disciplined a child in an inappropriate way, the children were visibly shaken and upset by the incident,
                        and there had been past allegations of domestic violence involving the father. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 494, 748 S.E.2d 594 (2013).

                        Violation of Order Pending Appeal. - While an appeal from an order providing for the custody of a minor child removes the cause from the trial court to the appellate court, and while pending the appeal the trial court is without jurisdiction to punish
                        for contempt, the taking of an appeal does not authorize a violation of the custody order. If the custody order is upheld by the appellate court, the violation may be inquired into when the cause is remanded to the trial court.

                        Any parent, or any person, agency, organization or institution having custody of a minor child, or bringing an action or proceeding for the custody of such child, or a minor child by his guardian may institute an action for the support of such child as
                        hereinafter provided.

                        In the absence of pleading and proof that the circumstances otherwise warrant, the father and mother shall be primarily liable for the support of a minor child. In the absence of pleading and proof that the circumstances otherwise warrant, parents of
                        a minor, unemancipated child who is the custodial or noncustodial parent of a child shall share this primary liability for their grandchild's support with the minor parent, the court determining the proper share, until the minor
                        parent reaches the age of 18 or becomes emancipated. If both the parents of the child requiring support were unemancipated minors at the time of the child's conception, the parents of both minor parents share primary liability
                        for their grandchild's support until both minor parents reach the age of 18 or become emancipated. If only one parent of the child requiring support was an unemancipated minor at the time of the child's conception, the parents
                        of both parents are liable for any arrearages in child support owed by the adult or emancipated parent until the other parent reaches the age of 18 or becomes emancipated. In the absence of pleading and proof that the circumstances
                        otherwise warrant, any other person, agency, organization or institution standing in loco parentis shall be secondarily liable for such support. Such other circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, the relative ability
                        of all the above-mentioned parties to provide support or the inability of one or more of them to provide support, and the needs and estate of the child. The judge may enter an order requiring any one or more of the above-mentioned
                        parties to provide for the support of the child as may be appropriate in the particular case, and if appropriate the court may authorize the application of any separate estate of the child to his support. However, the judge may
                        not order support to be paid by a person who is not the child's parent or an agency, organization or institution standing in loco parentis absent evidence and a finding that such person, agency, organization or institution has
                        voluntarily assumed the obligation of support in writing. The preceding sentence shall not be construed to prevent any court from ordering the support of a child by an agency of the State or county which agency may be responsible
                        under law for such support.

                    If the court orders an amount other than the amount determined by application of the presumptive guidelines, the court shall make findings of fact as to the criteria that justify varying from the guidelines and the basis for the amount

                    time of the support obligation. The total amount of these payments is to be applied to the arrearage until all arrearages and fees are satisfied or until further order of the court.

                    Periodically, but at least once every four years, the Conference of Chief District Judges shall review the guidelines to determine whether their application results in appropriate child support award amounts. The Conference may modify the guidelines accordingly.
                    The Conference shall give the Department of Health and Human Services, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and the general public an opportunity to provide the Conference with information relevant to the development and review
                    of the guidelines. Any modifications of the guidelines or criteria shall be reported to the General Assembly by the Administrative Office of the Courts before they become effective by delivering copies to the President Pro Tempore
                    of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The guidelines, when adopted or modified, shall be provided to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Administrative Office of the Courts, which shall disseminate
                    them to the public through local IV-D offices, clerks of court, and the media.

                    Periodically, but at least once every four years, the Conference of Chief District Judges shall review the guidelines to determine whether their application results in appropriate child support award amounts. The Conference may modify the guidelines accordingly.
                    The Conference shall give the Department of Human Resources, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and the general public an opportunity to provide the Conference with information relevant to the development and review of the guidelines.
                    Any modifications of the guidelines or criteria shall be reported to the General Assembly by the Administrative Office of the Courts before they become effective by delivering copies to the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the
                    Speaker of the House of Representatives. The guidelines, when adopted or modified, shall be provided to the Department of Human Resources and the Administrative Office of the Courts, which shall disseminate them to the public through
                    local IV-D offices, clerks of court, and the media.

                    Until July 1, 1990, the advisory guidelines adopted by the Conference of Chief District Judges pursuant to this subsection as formerly written shall operate as presumptive guidelines and the factors adopted by the Conference of Chief District Judges pursuant
                    to this subsection as formerly written shall constitute criteria for varying from the amount of support determined by the guidelines.

                    contempt entered for child support until the appeal is decided, if justice requires.

                            Subsection (a) does not specify that it requires judicial determination of custody before its provision can be utilized by a person or agency bringing an action for support. Craig v. Kelley, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                            458, 366 S.E.2d 249 (1988).

                            Visitation and child support rights are independent rights accruing primarily to the benefit of the minor child and one is not, and may not be made, contingent upon the other.

                            Support Exemption. - G.S. 105-149 has been repealed in apparent effort by General Assembly to bring North Carolina's personal income tax laws into conformity with the 1984 revisions of federal tax statutes. Under federal law, custodial parent, not parent
                            paying primary support, is entitled to claim support exemption for child under circumstances such as are present here. However, federal law also provides that custodial parent may waive right to claim exemption. Cohen v. Cohen,

                            Mentally Retarded Children - North Carolina trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over a father's action seeking modification of a New Jersey trial court's order requiring the father to pay child support for a mentally retarded child who was born
                            in 1964, after the child and her mother moved to North Carolina and the father moved to Maryland, and the trial court's judgment that the father's request for an order terminating his obligation to pay child support had to
                            be granted, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4(c)</a></cite>, was affirmed on appeal. Lombardi v. Lombardi, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite>                            540, 579 S.E.2d 419 (2003).

                            Support and Counsel Fees Pendente Lite on Husband's Denial of Paternity. - Where, upon wife's motion in the cause to require defendant to provide support for the minor child of the marriage, made after decree of absolute divorce, husband filed an affidavit
                            denying paternity, and at his instance the issue was transferred to the civil issue docket, the trial court had the discretionary power to order defendant to provide for support of the child and counsel fees pendente lite.

                            The requirement that a voluntary assumption of support be reduced to writing, imposed on those who are secondarily liable under subsection (b) of this section, does not apply to parents of unemancipated minors who have had a child, for they are primarily
                            liable for support of the infant. Whitman v. Kiger, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 533 S.E.2d 807 (2000), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 360</cite>, 543 S.E.2d 476 (2001).

                            Judicial Determination of Custody. - Subsection (a) does not specify that it requires judicial determination of custody before its provisions can be utilized by person or agency bringing action for support. Thus, where mother in her proceeding for modification
                            of support order also requested a formal adjudication of custody, which request was granted, plaintiff met the custody requirements of subsection (a). Craig v. Kelley, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                            458, 366 S.E.2d 249 (1988).

                            Custodial Parent as Real Party in Interest. - If the custodial parent provides support which the other parent is legally obligated to provide, then the custodial parent is a real party in interest in an action to recover the support so provided. Griffith

                            Although plaintiff alleged that he was the father of the child, he did not allege that he had custody, therefore under the provisions of this section, only a parent who has custody of a minor child may bring an action for its support. Becton v. George,

                            Required Notice Deemed Waived. - Where both parties introduced evidence on the reasonable needs of the children and the relative ability of each parent to pay support for the children, the defendant's failure to give proper notice of his request that
                            a hearing be conducted regarding these issues was waived and the trial court was required to find facts and enter conclusions on this evidence. Browne v. Browne, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite>                            617, 400 S.E.2d 736 (1991); Rose v. Rose, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 90, 422 S.E.2d 446 (1992).

                            guidelines must, unless the request is made in the original pleadings, give at least ten days written notice as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.5ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.5(d)(1)</a></cite>.

                            Motion in Cause. - Plaintiff-husband, as a parent seeking custody, could seek to have his child support obligation determined through a motion in the cause in the divorce action. He was not precluded from doing so by the fact that the court had not previously
                            entered orders in that action relating to child support. Bottomley v. Bottomley, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 346 S.E.2d 317 (1986).

                            Discovery Held Overbroad. - For a case in which it was held that plaintiff's discovery request in a child-support case was overbroad and should have been limited by the trial court, see Powers v. Parisher, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite>                            400, 409 S.E.2d 725 (1991), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 286</cite>, 417 S.E.2d 254 (1992).

                            Prayer for Increase in Support Actually Action Under this Section. - Although plaintiff's complaint prayed for an increase in child support based upon a substantial change in circumstances, plaintiff's action was in fact brought pursuant to subsection
                            (a) of this section because the amount sought to be increased was paid pursuant to a non-judicial separation agreement; plaintiff was actually asking the Court to enter an original award of child support. Powers v. Parisher,

                            Subsection (b) of this section, as amended in 1981, does not diminish a father's responsibilities. Rather, it enlarges a mother's responsibilities by making both parents primarily liable for the support of their children. Alamance County Hosp. v. Neighbors,
                            <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 362</cite>, 338 S.E.2d 87 (1986).

                            Equal Duty of Support Is Rule Rather Than Exception. - Today, the equal duty of both parents to support their children is the rule rather than the exception is virtually all states. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>,

                            Support for minor children is an obligation shared by both parents according to their relative abilities to provide support and the reasonable needs and estate of the child. Boyd v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                            71, 343 S.E.2d 581 (1986).

                            But Equal Financial Contributions Are Not Necessarily Required. - Subsection (b) of this section provides that both mothers and fathers share primary liability for the support of their minor children, thus imposing an equal legal duty on the parent of
                            each gender. However, subsection (b) neither mandates equal financial contributions nor requires any contribution from either party where it is proved that the circumstances otherwise warrant. Plott v. Plott,
                            <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 310 S.E.2d 51 (1983), modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 863 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Equal legal duty to support does not impose an equal financial contribution by both parties. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 863 (1985).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Equal duty to support does not necessarily mean that the amount of child support is to be automatically divided equally between the parties. Rather, the amount of each parent's obligation varies in accordance with their respective financial resources.
                            Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 863 (1985).

                            Equal Financial Contributions Not Imposed Where Unfair or Burdensome. - The parental obligation for child support is not primarily an obligation of the father but is one shared by both parents. This equal duty to support, however, does not impose upon
                            both parties an equal financial contribution when such an allocation would be unfair or place too great a burden on a party. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 863
                            (1985).

                            Discretion of Court as to Amount and Source of Support. - The trial court has considerable discretion in determining whether and in what amounts the party from whom support is sought may be ordered to provide it. Therefore, the trial court has a duty
                            to exercise an informed and considered discretion with respect to the support obligation of the parties. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 310 S.E.2d 51 (1983), modified
                            on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 863 (1985).

                            Amount of Each Party's Contribution Determined on Case-by-Case Basis. - The amount of each party's contribution to child support is generally determined by the judge on a case-by-case basis. The judge must evaluate the circumstances of each family and
                            also consider certain statutory requirements in fixing the amount of child support. Subsection (c) of this section mandates that the trial judge consider the certain factors in setting child support amounts. Plott v. Plott,
                            <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 863 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Relative Ability to Pay May Be Considered. - Although Session Laws 1981, c. 613 had the effect of changing the previous rule that the mother was only secondarily liable for child support, in all other relevant respects involving the relative ability or
                            inability of the mother and father to provide such support, the relevant statutory provisions remained unchanged. Therefore, other circumstances may properly be considered, including the relative ability of the parties to pay.
                            Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 310 S.E.2d 51 (1983), modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 863 (1985).

                        <p>
                            It was apparent from the record that the trial court considered both the existence and structure of appellee's trust fund and appellant's income as an ophthalmologist in making its determination that appellant should contribute one-half of child's necessary
                            and actual expenses. It concluded that a father in an established ophthalmologic practice, and who had a 1991 income of at least $88,000 was able to contribute half of his child's support. Munn v. Munn,
                            <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 435 S.E.2d 74 (1993).

                        <p>
                            Consideration of Ability to Pay - Procedure. - Defendant's contention that summary judgment was improper because he was financially unable to make the child support payments called for in the agreement would be relevant only to future payments and could
                            be considered only after the defendant had filed a motion in the cause for the trial court to set an amount of child support which differs from that in the separation agreement. Nisbet v. Nisbet,

                            Voluntary Unemployment. - Trial court order finding that mother was obligated to pay child support to her ex-husband for their three minor children who resided with the ex-husband, which was based on a deviation from the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines,
                            was error; although the deviation was supported by the evidence in that the mother was voluntarily unemployed and had cash reserves to meet her financial obligations of the children, the amount awarded was not supported by
                            any evidence. Roberts v. McAllister, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 621 S.E.2d 191 (2005), appeal dismissed, - N.C. - , 629 S.E.2d 608 (2006).

                            Determination of Relative Ability. - The relative ability of the parties to contribute under subsections (b) and (c) of this section cannot depend solely on the determination of monthly available income after expenses. Rather, it must be reflective of
                            all the relevant circumstances, including the relative hardship to each parent in contributing to the reasonable needs of the child. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 657,

                            Stepparent in Loco Parentis. - If an individual assumes the status of in loco parentis, he is secondarily liable to the child's natural parents for the support of that child, and if the needs of the child exceed the ability of the child's natural parents
                            to meet those needs, then and only then is the individual in loco parentis secondarily responsible for the deficiency. Duffey v. Duffey, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 438 S.E.2d

                            By signing a separation agreement in which he agreed to pay child support to plaintiff, stepparent voluntarily and in writing extended his status of in loco parentis and gave the court the authority to order that support be paid. Duffey v. Duffey,

                            Child's Needs and Hardship to Each Parent Must Be Considered. - Enforcement of each parent's statutory duty to contribute child support depends on the urgency of the needs of the child and the relative hardship to each parent in contributing to these
                            needs. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 310 S.E.2d 51 (1983), modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 863 (1985).

                            Children with Property of Their Own. - There is nothing in the statute to suggest any legislative intent to change the firmly established rule that the supporting parent who can do so remains obligated to support his or her minor children, even though
                            they may have property of their own. Sloop v. Friberg, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 690, 320 S.E.2d 921 (1984).

                            Although trial court found as a fact that each child had an estate in excess of $300,000.00, the separate incomes and estates of children did not diminish or relieve the obligation of the defendant father to support his children, even though former husband's
                            income was about $37,000.00. Browne v. Browne, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 617, 400 S.E.2d 736 (1991).

                            Education Needs of Child. - Although public funding may have been available for special education needs of child, but was not sought by custodial parent, court did not err in requiring noncustodial parent to pay costs of child's educational expenses in

                            showed that his attendance at the school was in his best interests, that he would continue to benefit in the future from the curriculum, and that he was making satisfactory academic progress toward a non-traditional graduation.

                            Father's Reduction in Payments as Evidence He Had Not Met Obligations. - Where judge found that mother provided no evidence that she was entitled to payment of back child support, the evidence did not support the judge's finding; there was evidence that
                            father had not met his child support obligations where father testified that in 1985, he reduced the amount of the payments due to a decrease in salary. Correll v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite>                            464, 380 S.E.2d 580 (1989).

                            show that, in good faith reliance on the conduct of his ex-wife, he had changed his position for the worse; the only change made in his position was the retention to his benefit of money owed for the support of his children.

                            Applicability of Doctrine of "Necessaries". - Although the normal vehicle today for enforcing the obligation of support is undoubtedly the payment of court-ordered support pursuant to statute, the common law provided another vehicle through the so-called
                            doctrine of "necessaries." North Carolina accepts this process for enforcing a parent's obligation to support minor children. Alamance County Hosp. v. Neighbors, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 362</cite>,

                            Right of Third Party to Recover for "Necessaries" Furnished to Child. - Because a child's right to support continues unimpaired despite the divorce of his or her parents, the right of a third party provider of goods or services to claim against the noncustodial
                            parent also continues, unimpaired by contracts or judicial decrees or orders affecting the relations between the parents. Alamance County Hosp. v. Neighbors, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 362</cite>,
                            338 S.E.2d 87 (1986).

                        <p>
                            The payment of court-ordered child support does not bar a third party from seeking reimbursement directly from a noncustodial parent for "necessaries" provided to that parent's minor child. However, because the third party provider's right to recover
                            against the parent is based upon the child's right to support, the third party provider must still show that the services or goods provided were legal "necessaries" and that the parent against whom relief is sought has failed
                            or refused to provide them. In this context, any payment a noncustodial parent has made for the support of his or her child would be a factor for the trial judge to consider in deciding whether the parent has in fact met the
                            obligation to support that child. Alamance County Hosp. v. Neighbors, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 362</cite>, 338 S.E.2d 87 (1986).

                            Persons Standing in Loco Parentis. - Although support of a child ordinarily is a parental obligation, other persons standing in loco parentis may also acquire a duty to support the child; thus, in a case where custodial father and child had believed him
                            to be the father of the child, the duty of support should have accompanied the right to custody. Price v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 68</cite>, 484 S.E.2d 528 (1997).

                            History and Purpose of Guidelines. - As of July 1, 1991, the State adopted guidelines based on income-sharing approach for determining child support. These guidelines were promulgated by Conference of Chief District Judges in accordance with subsection
                            (c1) of this section. Income-sharing formulas ignore problem of attempting to determine cost of raising a child and are based instead on assumption that each parent will contribute all of his or her income to one fund. Then
                            the formulas provide method for equitably dividing income among family members. Income-sharing formulas seeking to equalize financial burden of divorce so that all family members experience about same proportional reduction
                            in standard of living after divorce. Cohen v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 396 S.E.2d 344 (1990).

                        <p>
                            Constitutionality of Guidelines. - Child Support Guidelines (2002) did not violate substantive due process; the State had a compelling interest in regulating child support obligations, and through establishing a rebuttable presumption with regard to the
                            guidelines under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4(c)</a></cite>, the act was narrowly drawn. Row v. Row, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 450,

                            Effective Date of Guidelines. - At time support order was entered in June, 1989, the Guidelines in subsection (c1) of this section were only advisory in nature. The Guidelines became presumptive as of October 1, 1989. New presumptive guidelines became
                            effective July 1, 1990. Therefore, at the time, (June 1989) order was entered, trial judge was neither required to follow nor refer to advisory guidelines in order.

                            would be unjust or inappropriate. Guilford County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Easter v. Easter, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 461 S.E.2d 798 (1995), modified,

                            A trial court may deviate from the Guidelines when it finds, by the greater weight of the evidence, application of the Guidelines: (1) would not meet or would exceed the reasonable needs of the child considering the relative ability of each parent to
                            provide support; or (2) would be otherwise unjust or inappropriate. Barham v. Barham, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 487 S.E.2d 774 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 570</cite>,

                            Although the trial court properly considered the father's settlement trust to be non-recurring income when making its child support order, the case was remanded because the trial court failed to make specific findings regarding the reasonable needs of
                            the child when it deviated from the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines. Spicer v. Spicer, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 283, 607 S.E.2d 678 (2005).

                        <p>
                            North Carolina Child Support Guidelines were inapplicable because the combined monthly adjusted gross income of the parents exceeded $20,000; thus, the trial court was required to make a case-by-case determination. Consequently, the trial court was not
                            bound by the Guidelines in determining the father's child support obligations. Diehl v. Diehl, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 630 S.E.2d 25 (2006).

                            In considering a father's motion to modify child support, the trial court did not err in deviating only slightly from the guidelines; the guidelines were constitutional, and the slight deviation was not manifestly unsupported by reason. Row v. Row,

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to deviate from the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines because it made findings regarding both the needs of the child and each parent's relative ability to provide support and did not find application
                            of the Guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate. Simms v. Bolger, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 522 (2019).

                            Trial Court's Methodology Proper. - Even if the father had assigned error to the methodology employed by the trial court, there was no error in the trial court's determination process under circumstances in which both parties maintained full-time employment
                            and earned average monthly incomes in excess of $10,000; the trial court's findings of fact included an updated analysis of the child's total reasonable needs while in the mother's care, the mother's pro rata share of the parties'
                            gross income, and the mother's pro rata share of the child's reasonable needs while in her custody. Pascoe v. Pascoe, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 645 S.E.2d 156 (2007).

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that it would not base the child support calculation on the estates of the parties because they were essentially equal, and neither party would be required to deplete his or her accounts and properties
                            to support the child. Kleoudis v. Kleoudis, - N.C. App. - , 843 S.E.2d 277 (2020).

                            The child support guidelines were held inapplicable and child support was determined by assessing the particular facts of the case where a father's monthly income was $15,181; the denial of a father's motion to reduce child support was affirmed where
                            the trial court acknowledged the father's income decrease, considered the father's family related expenses and support obligations, and determined, based on the father's net income of over $5,000 per month, that a reduction
                            in child support from the original amount of $2,500 was unwarranted. Trevillian v. Trevillian, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 595 S.E.2d 206 (2004).

                            Ultimate Objective. - While it is the legal obligation of the father (now father and mother) to provide for the support of his minor children, and while the welfare of the child is a primary consideration in matters of custody and maintenance, yet common
                            sense and common justice dictate that the ultimate object in such matters is to secure support commensurate with the needs of the child and the ability of the father to meet the needs. Holt v. Holt,

                            In deviating from child support guidelines, the trial court was required to make findings of fact as to the criteria that justified varying from the guidelines and the basis of the amount ordered; the court committed error because its findings were insufficient

                            Computing the amount of child support is normally an exercise of sound judicial discretion, requiring the judge to review all of the evidence before him. Absent a clear abuse of discretion, a judge's determination of what is a proper amount of support
                            will not be disturbed on appeal. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 863 (1985).

                        <p>
                            The trial court's findings lacked the necessary specificity to justify its deviation from child support guidelines, where it failed to make any findings regarding the child's reasonable needs, including his education, maintenance, or accustomed standard
                            of living. State ex rel. Fisher v. Lukinoff, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 507 S.E.2d 591 (1998).

                            Trial court did not err in referencing a father's income when dismissing the father's complaint for child support because that information was relevant to the father's claim for child support.

                            Alimony and Child Support Considered Together. - Trial court reasonably could have concluded that the wife's alimony award needed to be increased because the wife's reasonable expenses had increased after the husband was no longer obligated to pay child
                            support because the parties, minor child had turned 18-years-old. The original alimony award calculated the wife's reasonable expenses by attributing some of those expenses to the minor child, but the wife's reasonable expenses
                            increased when the minor child attained the age of majority and those expenses were no longer attributed to the minor child. Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 656

                            including non-taxable, deferred or declined income, flowing therefrom, would all bear relevance to child support proceeding. Shaw v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 481 S.E.2d

                            or controlled by defendant, or jointly with others. Shaw v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 481 S.E.2d 365 (1997).

                            Ordinarily, Present Earnings Should Be Basis for Award. - In determining the ability of the father (or mother) to support the child, the court ordinarily should examine the father's (or mother's) present earnings, rather than select the earnings for a
                            single year in the past and use that as the basis for an award. Holt v. Holt, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 223 S.E.2d 542 (1976).

                        <p>
                            If father (or mother) is honestly and in good faith engaged in a business to which he is properly adapted, and is making a good faith effort to earn a reasonable income, the award for child support should be based on the amount which defendant is earning
                            when the award is made. Holt v. Holt, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 223 S.E.2d 542 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Ordinarily, father's (or mother's) ability to pay is determined by his income at the time the award is made if father (or mother) is honestly engaged in a business to which he is properly adapted and is in fact seeking to operate his business profitably.

                            The general rule is that the ability of a party to pay child support is determined by that person's income at the time the award is made. Atwell v. Atwell, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 328 S.E.2d 47 (1985).

                            But capacity to earn may be the basis of an award if it is based upon a proper finding that father (or mother) is deliberately depressing his income or indulging himself in excessive spending because of a disregard of his obligation to provide reasonable
                            support for his spouse and children. Beall v. Beall, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 669</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 407 (1976).

                            A person's capacity to earn income may be made the basis of an award if there is a finding that the party deliberately depressed his or her income or otherwise acted in deliberate disregard of the obligation to provide reasonable support for the child.

                            capacity to earn may be made the basis of the award. Under these circumstances, his motion to reduce the amount of child support will be denied. Goodhouse v. DeFravio, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 290 S.E.2d

                            Where plaintiff took early retirement at age 51, with a 3 year old daughter to support, chose to remain unemployed, despite having many skills, and there was testimony that plaintiff could earn at least $20,000 without decreasing his retirement benefits,
                            the trial court properly based child support award on plaintiff's potential income. Osborne v. Osborne, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 497 S.E.2d 113 (1998).

                            Finding Where Award Is Based on Capacity to Earn. - To base an award for child support on capacity to earn rather than actual earnings, there should be a finding based on evidence that father (or mother) is failing to exercise his capacity to earn because
                            of a disregard of his obligation to provide reasonable support for his spouse and children. Holt v. Holt, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 223 S.E.2d 542 (1976); Stanley v. Stanley,

                            Only where there are findings, based on competent evidence, to support a conclusion that the supporting spouse or parent is deliberately depressing his or her income to avoid family responsibilities can the "earning capacity" rule be applied. Whitley

                            A party's capacity to earn income may become the basis of an award if it is found that the party deliberately depressed its income or otherwise acted in deliberate disregard of the obligation to provide reasonable support for the child. Askew v. Askew,
                            <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 458 S.E.2d 217 (1995).

                            When calculating the child support obligation owed by a parent, a showing of bad faith income depression by the parent is a mandatory prerequisite for imputing income to that parent.

                            Must Be Sufficient Evidence of Proscribed Intent. - A trial court's conclusion underlying imposition of the earnings capacity rule must be based upon evidence that the actions which reduced the party's income were not taken in good faith. There must be
                            sufficient evidence of the proscribed intent. Fischell v. Rosenberg, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 368 S.E.2d 11 (1988).

                            Consideration of Spouse's Capacity to Earn Held Error. - Trial court could not consider father's capacity to earn in computing his income where the evidence indicated that he lost his job due to no fault of his own, and the court's order contained no
                            findings that he had deliberately stopped working to avoid his support obligations. Greer v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 399 S.E.2d 399 (1991).

                            Support Should Not Have Been Based on Earning Capacity. - Where there was no evidence that defendant was engaging in any tactics to avoid paying child support, defendant had purchased a substantial amount of farm equipment for use in his farming operation,
                            and he had experienced a net loss from farming for the last three years but had made a profit from this business in the past, the evidence pointed to a genuine effort by defendant to engage in his chosen profession and to support
                            his family as well; therefore, the case was remanded so the court could make a determination based upon defendant's present earnings instead of his earning capacity. Cameron v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite>                            168, 380 S.E.2d 121 (1989).

                            Wrongful Inclusion of Future Personal Expenditures. - Where trial court includes personal expenditures not yet made by party with no concrete plans to make such an expenditure, award entered cannot possibly reflect the relative abilities of parties to
                            pay support at that time. Witherow v. Witherow, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 392 S.E.2d 627 (1990).

                            Determination of trial court not necessary to make finding of bad faith in reduction of income where the party seeking support modification was the custodial parent was not supported by current case law, nor was the trial court correct in concluding that
                            when a custodial parent sought a change of child support based upon a reduction in income, that custodial parent had to request the court to make a finding of fact as to his or her "good faith." Fischell v. Rosenberg,
                            <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 368 S.E.2d 11 (1988).

                            Father's cost-free housing was properly considered to be a form of gross-income, and thus, recurring income for purposes of making a child support award. Spicer v. Spicer, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 283, 607

                            The inclusion of a gift when calculating a defendant's income for child support purposes was an error, where there was no evidence on the part of defendant's parents that such a gift would be reoccurring. Sloan v. Sloan,

                            But Gift Rent and Vehicle Payments by Mother's Father Should Have Been Included in Support Obligation. - Trial court erred in failing to include the mother's gift income as attributable income in calculating a father's child support obligation; the payment
                            of the mother's vehicle and rent payments by her father totaled $1,890, which should have been included in calculating income in the child support order. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite>                            838, 635 S.E.2d 495 (2006).

                            N.C. Ann. R. specifically allowed for extraordinary expenses for private school tuition and camp fees and the trial court was entitled to consider expenses for child care in its support determination pursuant to

                            Medical insurance premiums paid by a parent on behalf of a child are actual expenditures which must be considered in computing retroactive child support. Lawrence v. Tise, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 419

                            Failure of the trial court to treat a portion of mother's premiums as an actual expenditure for the purposes of calculating retroactive support was not error, because there was no evidence in the record to support a finding on the portion of the premiums
                            for the joint policy attributable only to coverage of the child. In the absence of such evidence, the trial court would only be speculating as to the child's share of the cost, and this it could not do. Lawrence v. Tise,

                            Consideration of Health Insurance Coverage Erroneous. - According to former subdivision (c1)(6) of this section, the trial court was not allowed to vary the presumptive amount of child support based upon the "provision of health insurance coverage;" therefore,
                            by varying the presumptive guideline amount because of the defendant's maintenance of health insurance on the plaintiff and the children, the trial court acted in violation of this section. Browne v. Browne,

                            distribution order. No child support order is ever final and delaying child support order in lengthy case until after equitable distribution issue was decided would have prolonged an already long-pending case. Trial court's
                            decision to enter child support order prior to determination of equitable distribution issue was under the statute. Cohen v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 396 S.E.2d 344 (1990).

                            a trial court had not abused its discretion where, based on the evidence before it, the trial court chose not to modify the effective date of a permanent award.

                            Amount Should Be Fair and Not Confiscatory. - An order for the maintenance of a child should be in an amount that is fair and not confiscatory in light of the parent's earning ability.

                            Allowance Should Be Made for Parent's Living Expenses. - In determining the amount of an order for the support of children, a reasonable allowance should be made for the living expenses of their father (or mother) in the light of his earnings. Fuchs v.

                            Dividing Parent's Income by Number of Dependents Is Disapproved. - Fixing the amount of support for minor children by dividing the income of their father (or mother) by the number of people dependent upon him for support is not approved. Fuchs v. Fuchs,

                            Conduct of Parties May Be Considered. - In addition to the factors enumerated in subsection (c) of this section, the trial court may consider the conduct of the parties, the equities of the given case, and any other relevant facts in determining child
                            support. Warner v. Latimer, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 314 S.E.2d 789 (1984).

                        <p>
                            This section clearly allows the trial court to consider other facts of the particular case in arriving at the amount of defendant's share of support in an action for reimbursement. Thus, while the defendant's ability to pay and his earning capacity are
                            factors to be considered, they are not controlling. The court may also consider the conduct of the parties and the equities of the case. Stanley v.

                            Improper Use of Earning Capacity Rule - Trial court erred in modifying a father's child support obligation pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4</a></cite>; the trial court found
                            that while the father reduced his income, he did not act in bad faith, and a finding of bad faith was required to apply the earning capacity rule under N.C. Child Support Guidelines, 2003 Ann. R. N.C. 33, 35. Cook v. Cook,

                            Findings and Conclusions of Law Required. - In setting amounts for child support, where the trial court sits without a jury, the judge is required to find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon, and to direct the entry
                            of the appropriate judgment. Dishmon v. Dishmon, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 292 S.E.2d 293 (1982).

                            Trial court erred in failing to make findings regarding the reasonable needs of a child for support, or regarding its refusal to award support for the time between the filing of suit for support and the entry of the support order. State ex rel. Gillikin

                            Findings Must Indicate Consideration of Needs and Earnings. - Conclusions of law must be based upon factual findings specific enough to indicate to the appellate court that the judge below took due regard of the particular estates, earnings, conditions,
                            and accustomed standard of living of both the child and the parents. Dishmon v. Dishmon, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 292 S.E.2d 293 (1982).

                            Findings as to Child's Past and Present Expenses Required. - In order to determine the reasonable needs of the child, the trial court must hear evidence and make findings of specific fact on the child's actual past expenditures and present reasonable
                            expenses. Atwell v. Atwell, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 328 S.E.2d 47 (1985).

                            Minor child's hospitalization and its resulting costs constituted a substantial change in circumstances. Thus case was remanded to take into account the parties' abilities to provide support for the minor child's medical expenses and to enter an order
                            modifying the support order. Lawrence v. Nantz, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 445 S.E.2d 87 (1994).

                            Award Where Father Has Substantial Income. - In an action for child support, the court, in making its award, should keep in mind that children of a man of substantial income are entitled to live accordingly. McLeod v. McLeod,

                            Credit for Voluntary Expenditures. - As to granting of credit towards payment of court-ordered child support for voluntary expenditures, see Goodson v. Goodson, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 231 S.E.2d 178 (1977).

                        <p>
                            The trial court has a wide discretion in deciding initially whether justice requires that a credit be given under the facts of each case and then in what amount the credit is to be awarded. The better view allows credit when equitable considerations exist
                            which would create an injustice if credit were not allowed. Evans v. Craddock, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 300 S.E.2d 908 (1983).

                        <p>
                            Expenses During Visitation. - Credit is not likely to be appropriate for frivolous expenses or for expenses incurred in entertaining or feeding the child during visitation periods. Evans v. Craddock, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite>                            438, 300 S.E.2d 908 (1983).

                        <p>
                            Whether credit is allowed for time spent in visitation with the noncustodial parent depends on the facts of the particular case and is a matter within the court's discretion, as the fact that a child spends a certain amount of time with one parent does
                            not necessarily mean that his reasonable and necessary living expenses are incurred proportionally. Gibson v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 316 S.E.2d 99 (1984).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's use of one-third of mother's total fixed expenses to establish reasonable needs of child was neither unfair nor impermissible where the expense figures in mother's affidavit of financial status included expenses only for herself and the
                            child, as she had not remarried, and furthermore, where the trial court not only found that mother's living expenses were reasonable, but also reduced several of the figures on the affidavit before making that finding, and
                            where, with the exception of the amount of scheduled visitation, father presented no evidence on which the court could have based other findings regarding the child's expenses and needs. Gibson v. Gibson,

                            Parties Cannot Consent to Improperly Based Order. - The parties, by their consent, cannot enable a trial judge to enter an order not based upon consideration of the several factors listed in subsection (c) of this section and

                            Method of Payment Is Within Discretion of Court. - In utilizing the provision in subsection (e) of this section that payment for the support of a minor child shall be paid by lump sum payment, periodic payments, or by transfer of title or possession of
                            personal property of any interest therein as the court may order, the trial court is vested with broad discretion, and is not limited to ordering any one of the designated methods of payment. In keeping with the court's powers,
                            an order under this section will be upheld barring an abuse of that discretion. Weaver v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 634, 364 S.E.2d 706, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 330</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in making its award of lump sum and ongoing monthly child support payments because there was no evidence as to the actual impact on the father's future income from the lump sum payments; once the actual impact
                            on the father's income was realized, it could well support a new motion to modify the father's child support obligation. Simms v. Bolger, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 522 (2019).

                            Trial court's creation of a trust consisting of certain real and personal property owned by the parties in order to secure payment of alimony and child support was a proper exercise of its discretion in applying the provisions of subsection (e) of this
                            section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.7ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.7(a)</a></cite> and (c) and would be affirmed. Weaver v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 634,

                            Amount Not Excessive. - Where defendant earned one hundred thirty-two dollars ($132.00) a week and had monthly expenses in the amount of fifty-two dollars ($52.00), the court's order for defendant to pay one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month in child
                            support was not an abuse of discretion; defendant had been paying plaintiff one hundred dollars ($100.00) per week voluntarily for several months prior to the hearing, had testified that he would continue to do so, and the
                            court had made extensive findings regarding the child's needs, the parents' estates and earnings, etc. Rawls v. Rawls, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 381 S.E.2d 179 (1989).

                            Yearly support payment of $37,871.89 held not excessive where payor earned about $200,000.00 per year and where family enjoyed very high standard of living prior to dissolution of marriage and where court found, based on payor's testimony, that payor
                            could pay any amount court might order up to and including $71,318.04. Cohen v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 396 S.E.2d 344 (1990).

                            Improper Reduction of Child Support Payments. - Reducing child support payments by subtracting amount of money calculated to represent what custodial parent saves in expenses while the child is visiting with noncustodial parent was improper. Cohen v.

                            Consideration of Shared Custody Justified. - Fact that defendant had sole custody of one of the children and furnished the child's sole support, while defendant contributed to the support of the two children in plaintiff's custody, clearly justified the
                            trial court's consideration of the shared custody factor; trial court was not required to make findings as to how or why this custody arrangement rendered guidelines adopted pursuant to subsection (c1) inapplicable where the
                            guidelines provided for support payments to be based upon the noncustodial parent's gross income. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 359, 374 S.E.2d 441 (1988).

                            during the school district summer recess. Ellis v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 485 S.E.2d 82 (1997).

                            of income made to a bankruptcy court 18 months earlier under circumstances in which the trial court's order was devoid of findings that the father was deliberately depressing his income or indulging in excessive spending to

                            Sufficient Findings by the Court. - In spite of trial court's failure to make finding as to husband's net income, court's findings regarding gross income of husband and wife along with wife's net income and children's expenses was sufficient to satisfy
                            requirement under this section that court give due regard to parties' estates, earnings, conditions and standard of living in setting child support. Sikes v.

                            Trial court's findings supported its decision to use prior years' income from a business in the calculation of gross income for the determinations of alimony and child support because the trial court questioned whether the husband's reported income accurately
                            represented his income from the business; the trial court found that the husband's reported income was not credible. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826 S.E.2d 788 (2019).

                            In that the trial court's findings of fact regarding the parties' monthly gross income were supported by the evidence at trial, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in the court's determination of the appropriate child support obligation;
                            the mother's paystubs plainly disclosed her pay raise, bonus, and stock award, and they supported the mother's testimony and ultimately allowed the trial court to make sufficient findings to resolve the issue of her monthly

                            Financial Affidavits. - On appeal from a motion to modify child support, the court would not consider information outside a father's financial affidavit, i.e., expert testimony, to determine his expenses for the children; the father had sworn to the truthfulness
                            and completeness of his affidavit, and the parties' affidavits were competent evidence on which the trial court was allowed to rely in determining the expenses of the parties' children. Row v. Row,

                            Father showed no abuse of discretion in the trial court's findings of his expenses or allocation of those expenses to him because the trial court found the father's ability to pay child support based upon all of his expenses based upon his affidavit;
                            a reduction of the father's individual expenses would increase his ability to pay, and it would also increase the child's individual expenses. Kleoudis v. Kleoudis, - N.C. App. - , 843 S.E.2d 277 (2020).

                            In an action seeking an increase in child support over the amount set forth in separation agreement, order which contained no specific findings with respect to the actual past or present expenses incurred for the support of the children was insufficient
                            to support the court's conclusion that the reasonable needs of the children amounted to $2,800.00 per month. Holderness v. Holderness, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 370 S.E.2d 602

                            Trial court erred in ruling it had no authority to modify the income tax deduction provision of the parties' separation agreement as they requested a recalculation of child support, obliging the trial court to apply the entirety of the guidelines, including
                            not only the worksheets, but also the commentary. Ticconi v. Ticconi, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 730, 589 S.E.2d 371 (2003).

                            Remand to Allow Court to Make Findings. - Appellate court remanded case to allow trial court to make findings concerning the reasonable needs of child, the relative ability of the parents to support the child, and a determination of whether a variation
                            from the Guidelines was appropriate on these grounds. Brooker v. Brooker, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 285, 515 S.E.2d 234 (1999).

                        <p>
                            Mother admitted that clearly, the trial court did not use all of the expenses listed in the parties' financial affidavits; without more explanation, it was impossible to determine on appeal where the figures used by the trial court came from at all. Moreover,
                            although the trial court's child support order did contain certain historical costs associated with the children, it included no findings as to the individual costs and expenses the trial court expected to be associated with
                            each child in the future, and, while the trial court did make findings regarding the parents' particular estates, earnings, conditions, and accustomed standard of living, those were insufficient to remedy the absence of findings
                            explaining the reasonable needs of the children; accordingly, the case was remanded for further findings of fact regarding the amount of child support awarded. Diehl v.

                            Findings Unsupported by Evidence. - Judge erred by ordering mother to pay four hundred eighty dollars ($480.00) per month in child support; the figures of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and four hundred eighty dollars ($480.00) were not supported by any
                            evidence in the record on appeal and, despite the absence of mother's financial records, the judge could have determined the child's reasonable needs through evidence offered by father; however, the figures the judge arrived
                            at were unsupported by father's testimony, and were not supported by any of the previous orders entered in the case. Correll v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 380 S.E.2d 580

                            Accustomed Standard of Living. - Because the trial court unequivocally disregarded the principle that the accustomed standard of living is a factor to be considered and, instead based alimony on the standard of living the parties maintained after the
                            divorce there was prejudicial error. Barham v. Barham, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 487 S.E.2d 774 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 570</cite>, 494 S.E.2d 763 (1998).

                            Father demonstrated no abuse of discretion in the trial court's consideration of the conditions or accustomed standard of living of the parties or child because the trial court's findings demonstrated that it took "due regard" of the conditions and accustomed
                            standard of living of the child and parents; the father did not make any arguments regarding any dispute about the child's standard of living. Kleoudis v. Kleoudis, - N.C. App. - , 843 S.E.2d 277 (2020).

                            Change in Circumstances Not Shown. - Because the trial court found that defendant voluntarily quit his job, willfully and intentionally depressed his income, and failed to meet his burden of proof in showing a substantial change of circumstances, the
                            court entered a judgment against defendant denying his motion to reduce child support by reason of substantial change of circumstances. Askew v. Askew, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite>                            242, 458 S.E.2d 217 (1995).

                            Factors Properly Considered. - In its calculation of child support, the trial court relied on the financial affidavits of both parties to determine each party's average monthly shared expenses, and defendant incurred significantly higher monthly expenses
                            than plaintiff due to defendant having to pay the mortgages and maintenance on the marital home and vacation home; it was appropriate for the trial court to consider defendant's increased expenses relating to the two homes
                            in determining child support, and plaintiff's contention that the trial court erred in not making an even 50/50 allocation as to child support was without merit. Oltmanns v. Oltmanns, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite>                            326, 773 S.E.2d 347 (2015).

                            Father did not demonstrate any abuse of discretion in the trial court's child support calculations because the father's total fixed household expenses would be the same, whether a portion was attributed to the child or not, and in determining his ability
                            to pay child support, the trial court gave him credit for 100 percent of his expenses for both of his residences; the trial court's findings clearly demonstrated how the child support was calculated, and they were supported
                            by the evidence. Kleoudis v. Kleoudis, - N.C. App. - , 843 S.E.2d 277 (2020).

                            While the court cannot relieve parent of any contractual obligation he assumed to support his child in excess of what the law would require, it can, in the exercise of its inherent and statutory authority to provide for the welfare of minors, order payment

                            Court Retains Jurisdiction Despite Support Provisions of Separation Agreement or Arbitration Award. - While the amount of child support agreed on by the parties to a separation agreement is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be just
                            and reasonable, it remains within the authority of the courts pursuant to this Chapter to order payments for support in such amounts as will meet the reasonable needs of the child for health, education and maintenance, having
                            due regard to the estates, earnings, conditions, and accustomed standard of living of the child and the parties, the child care and homemaker contributions of each party, and other facts of the particular case. The same reasoning
                            applies to an arbitration award concerning child support. Crutchley v. Crutchley, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 518</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 793 (1982).

                            But Separation Agreements and Consent Judgments Cannot Be Ignored. - Provisions of a valid separation agreement, including a consent judgment based thereon, cannot be ignored or set aside by the court without the consent of the parties. Hinkle v. Hinkle,
                            <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 189</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 73 (1966), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13" target="_self">G.S. 50-13</a></cite>.

                            Level of Support in Separation Agreement Is Only One Factor in Decision. - When a trial court is called upon for the first time to determine the appropriate level of child support payments agreed upon in separation agreements, the "presumption" of reasonableness
                            of the agreed upon level of support in such cases is one of evidence only; that is, the agreed upon level of support constitutes some evidence of the appropriate level of support, but that this evidence must be weighed and
                            considered by the trial court together with all other relevant and competent evidence bearing upon the statutory factors set out in subsection (c) of this section; in other words, the trial court is writing upon a clean slate,
                            and the previously agreed upon level of support is but one factor to be considered. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 359, 374 S.E.2d 441 (1988).

                            When Agreement May Be Modified. - A separation agreement is a contract between the parties, and the court is without power to modify it except (1) to provide for adequate support for minor children, and (2) with the mutual consent of the parties thereto
                            where rights of third parties have not intervened. McKaughn v. McKaughn, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 702, 225 S.E.2d 616 (1976).

                            Amount Set by Agreement Is Presumptively Just and Reasonable. - Where parties to a separation agreement agree upon the amount for the support and maintenance of their minor children, there is a presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
                            that the amount mutually agreed upon is just and reasonable. Fuchs v. Fuchs, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 635</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 487 (1963); Winborne v. Winborne, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite>                            756, 255 S.E.2d 640, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 305</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 918 (1979).

                            It was not an abuse of discretion to decline to reduce a father's child support obligation for a prior period because (1) the obligation arose from an unincorporated separation agreement, and (2) contractual damages for the father's failure to pay support
                            could not be reduced. Lasecki v. Lasecki, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 24, 809 S.E.2d 296 (2017).

                            And May Not Be Changed Absent Change in Conditions. - Where parties to a separation agreement agree concerning the support and maintenance of their minor children, there is a presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the provisions
                            mutually agreed upon are just and reasonable, and the court is not warranted in ordering a change in the absence of any evidence of a change in conditions. McKaughn v. McKaughn, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite>                            702, 225 S.E.2d 616 (1976).

                            Trial court impermissibly modified a child support order by computing increases in the father's salary and applying those increases to payments over an 18-year period because the trial court failed to find a substantial change of circumstances as required
                            under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7(a)</a></cite> (2009); the incorporated agreement provided automatic annual increases in child support based on the
                            father's salary and failed to consider the needs of the children or other factors contained in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4(c)</a></cite>.

                            Or Absent Need for Increase. - Where parties to a separation agreement agree upon the amount for the support and maintenance of their minor children, there is a presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the amount mutually agreed upon
                            is just and reasonable. Upon motion, a trial court may not order an increase in the absence of any evidence of a change in conditions or of the need for such increase, particularly when the increase is awarded solely on grounds
                            that the father's income has increased so that he is able to pay a larger amount. Dishmon v. Dishmon, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 292 S.E.2d 293 (1982).

                            Child Referred to in Consent Judgment Is Under Protective Custody of Court. - Even though an order requiring father to make payments for the support of his child was entered by consent of the parents, the child was under the protective custody of the
                            court. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 223</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 370 (1957), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 298</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 400 (1958).

                            The effect of an order setting a lesser amount of child support than that provided for by separation agreement is not to deprive the custodial parent of her contractual right to recover the sums provided for in the agreement, but to limit her contempt
                            remedy to the sums provided for by the court order. Bottomley v. Bottomley, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 346 S.E.2d 317 (1986).

                            Right of Party to Separation Agreement to Bring Action. - When a case is properly before it, the court has the duty to award custody in accordance with the best interests of the child, and no agreement, consent or condition between the parents can interfere
                            with this duty or bind the court. Thus, the existence of a valid separation agreement containing provisions relating to the custody and support of minor children does not prevent one of the parties to the agreement from instituting
                            an action for a judicial determination of those same matters. Winborne v. Winborne, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 756, 255 S.E.2d 640, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 305</cite>,

                            No Obligation to Support Child Past Majority Despite Disability. - Where mother's testimony offered at the hearing showed that son was 18 years old, had graduated from high school, had a part-time job, and was attempting to raise money to go to college,
                            and mother further testified that son was not a normal 18 year old since he was involved in a wreck, trial court was without authority to order father to pay child support arrearages of five hundred dollars ($500.00); the evidence
                            showed that pursuant to subdivision (c)(2) of this section, defendant was relieved of any obligation to support his son after his graduation from high school on June 5, 1988, and even if mother's evidence was sufficient to
                            show that son was physically or mentally incapable of self-support, there was no longer a statutory obligation for parents to support their disabled adult children.

                            Obligation to Pay Is Independent of Compliance with Unrelated Provisions in Agreement. - The duty of a parent to pay child support as agreed to in a separation agreement will not be excused because the other parent does not comply with other provisions
                            of the separation agreement unrelated to the financial support of the children. Nisbet v. Nisbet, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 232, 402 S.E.2d 151, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 499</cite>,

                            Defendant's obligation to pay child support as provided in the separation agreement is not dependent upon plaintiff's compliance with visitation, nonharassment, or noncohabitation provisions in the same agreement. To hold otherwise would punish the children

                            <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48A</a></cite> into the statutes, the legal obligation to support one's child ends at age 18, absent a showing that the child is insolvent, unmarried
                            and physically or mentally incapable of earning a livelihood as contemplated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.8" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.8</a></cite>.

                            In the absence of an enforceable contract otherwise obligating a parent, North Carolina courts have no authority to order child support for a child who has attained the age of majority, unless the child has not completed secondary schooling, or, pursuant

                            Effect of One of Several Children Reaching Age 18. - While child support obligations ordered by a court terminate upon the child reaching age 18, unless the child is otherwise emancipated prior to reaching age 18 or the trial court in its discretion continues
                            to enforce the payment obligation after the child reaches age 18 and while the child is in primary or secondary school, when one of two or more minor children for whom support is ordered reaches age 18, and when the support
                            ordered to be paid is not allocated as to each individual child, the supporting parent has no authority to unilaterally modify the amount of the child support payment. The supporting parent must apply to the trial court for
                            modification. Craig v. Craig, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 615, 406 S.E.2d 656 (1991).

                            "Minor Child" under Prior Law. - Before the enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48A</a></cite>, it was evident that the meaning of "minor child" within the purview of
                            the custody and support statutes contemplated the common-law age of majority, age 21. Shoaf v. Shoaf, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 188 S.E.2d 19, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 287</cite>,

         Emancipation Decree Required.
        </b> - In a question of first impression, the appellate court held that, when the child of divorced parents left the custodial parent's home to live on his own, but was not decreed by a court to be legally emancipated,
                            the non-custodial parent's obligation to pay child support did not automatically terminate, because Article 35 of the Juvenile Code precluded the appellate court from accepting common law methods of emancipation for the purposes
                            of terminating child support payments; thus, the father's child support obligations could not have automatically terminated absent a decree of emancipation. Morris v. Powell, - N.C. App. - , 840 S.E.2d 223 (2020).

                            the trial court also should have considered its discretion to terminate support when the child turned 18, but prior to his high school graduation. Malone v. Hutchinson-Malone, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 544,

                            Judge Must Make Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. - In setting amounts for child support, where the trial court sits without a jury, the judge is required to find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon and direct
                            the entry of the appropriate judgment. Dishmon v. Dishmon, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 292 S.E.2d 293 (1982); Gibson v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 316

                            The requirements for findings of fact applicable to orders for alimony are also applicable to the determination of reasonable and adequate child support. Gebb v. Gebb, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 309, 335 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            The purpose of the requirement that the court make findings of those specific facts which support its ultimate disposition of the case is to allow a reviewing court to determine from the record whether the judgment, and the legal conclusions which underlie
                            it, represent a correct application of the law. Gibson v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 316 S.E.2d 99 (1984).

                            Effective appellate review of an order entered by a trial court sitting without a jury is largely dependent upon the specificity by which the order's rationale is articulated. Evidence must support findings; findings must support conclusions; conclusions
                            must support the judgment. Gibson v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 316 S.E.2d 99 (1984).

                            Remand for Further Findings. - The findings of fact in a case for child support, were insufficient to determine whether the trial court gave due regard to the estates of the parties and the case must be remanded for further findings on this matter, even
                            though there was ample evidence contained in the record about the estates of both parties. Sloan v. Sloan, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 392, 360 S.E.2d 816 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Case was remanded for additional fact-finding where the district court failed to identify the presumptive amount of support due under the Guidelines and where there was no analysis of the reasonable needs of the two minor children, other than a finding
                            that plaintiff's child care costs for one of the children was reasonable. Rowan County DSS v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 776, 522 S.E.2d 590 (1999).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred by failing to explain in its findings of fact why it did not award child support from the time of the filing of the paternity and child support complaint; judgment was reversed and case was remanded to trial court for further findings.

                            Trial court was required to conduct a hearing when the trial court neither made findings related to the needs of the children at the time of a modification hearing nor concluded whether the presumption of reasonableness in a separation agreement was rebutted.

                            from the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines, the trial court did not make sufficient findings of fact regarding the reasonable needs of the children; the order only made findings regarding health insurance and the fact

                            Case was remanded for an order addressing the validity of a mother's request for a deviation from the child support guidelines because the trial court failed to make specific findings regarding the ability of each parent to provide support and the accustomed
                            standard of the living of the children; given the absence of findings of fact, the court of appeals had no way to evaluate the correctness of the trial court's ruling that the guidelines would meet the reasonable needs of the

                            Trial court's failure to make findings of fact addressing the relative ability of the parents to provide support and the expenses that are needed to meet the children's needs requires a reviewing court to remand the relevant case to the trial court for
                            the entry of a new order containing additional findings of fact. Ferguson v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 768 S.E.2d 30 (2014).

                            In the absence of sufficient factual findings addressing the issue of a mother's ability to pay for children's education at a private school, the court of appeals could not determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by requiring her to pay
                            for the cost of the education; the trial court, despite the existence of a request for a deviation from the child support guidelines, did not make any findings addressing the issue of the parties' relative abilities to pay
                            the cost. Ferguson v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 768 S.E.2d 30 (2014).

                            Trial court had to revisit its calculations of gross income and net income used to determine child support and alimony because it had to make additional findings to support its determination of a husband's business income, which was used to calculate
                            gross income and determine child support; the trial court also had to make additional findings to account for the husband's mandatory retirement deduction and his reasonable health insurance expenses in the calculation of his
                            net income. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826 S.E.2d 788 (2019).

                            Miscalculation of $736 for the month of December 2016 did not require reversal and remand to the trial court because $736 was less than 2 percent of the total arrears of $52,659, and the parties would likely each incur more than $736 in attorney fees
                            in a remand for the trial court to make that small change to the arrears ordered; the de minimis error did not warrant reversal. Kleoudis v. Kleoudis, - N.C. App. - , 843 S.E.2d 277 (2020).

                            Contents of Findings. - There are no set guidelines as to what the findings of fact concerning the needs of the minor children must contain. The appellate courts of this State require only that the findings be based on competent evidence as to what the
                            needs of the children are, and that such findings sustain the conclusion that the support payments ordered are in such amount as to meet the reasonable needs of the child.

                            Adequate findings supported an order requiring a husband to pay children's private school tuition because (1) findings mandated by the Child Support Guidelines were not required, as the Child Support Guidelines did not apply, and (2) it was found that
                            private school was part of the children's accustomed standard of living, the parties were able to pay the tuition, and the parties had agreed to privately educate the children. Smith v. Smith,

                            Findings supported not treating payments from a father's parents as income because (1) the father testified the payments were loans, and (2) no express, separate, findings were required. Kaiser v. Kaiser, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite>                            499, 816 S.E.2d 223 (2018).

                            Findings did not support including payments from a mother's fiance as the mother's income because evidence indicating the payments were the fiance's share of household expenses was unresolved. Kaiser v. Kaiser, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite>                            499, 816 S.E.2d 223 (2018).

                            Trial court could find an investment account was a mother's property because the record supported finding income from the account either belonged to the mother or was given to the mother to use for the mother's benefit, as the account was in the mother's
                            name, the mother paid taxes on the account's dividend income, and nothing showed the mother was unable to use the income from that account. Kaiser v. Kaiser, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite>                            499, 816 S.E.2d 223 (2018).

                            Trial judge must make conclusions of law based on factual findings specific enough to show the appellate courts that the judge took due regard of the parties' estates; there is no requirement the trial court's findings use "magic words" such as "estates"
                            or "accustomed standard of living" where the findings demonstrate that it did consider the evidence as to these factors in setting the child support obligation. Kleoudis v. Kleoudis, - N.C. App. - , 843 S.E.2d 277 (2020).

                            In orders of child support, the court should make findings of specific facts (e.g. incomes, estates) to support a conclusion as to the relative abilities of the parties to provide support.

                            To support an award of payment for support, the judgment of the trial court should contain findings of fact which sustain the conclusion of law that the support payments ordered are in such amount as to meet the reasonable needs of the child for health,
                            education and maintenance, having due regard to the estates, earnings, conditions, accustomed standard of living of the child and the parties, and other facts of the particular care. Montgomery v. Montgomery,

                            The trial court must make specific findings on each of the factors specified in subsection (c) of this section. In addition, the case law may require certain findings, as when the award is based on earning capacity rather than present income. Once the
                            trial court has made such findings, they are conclusive if supported by any evidence, even if there is evidence contra. Sloop v. Friberg, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 690, 320 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            The trial judge must at least make findings sufficiently specific to indicate proper consideration of each of the factors established by subsection (c) of this section for a determination of child support. Spencer v. Spencer,

                            Orders for child support must be based upon the interplay of the trial court's conclusions of law as to the amount of support necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the child and the relative abilities of the parents to provide that amount. These conclusions
                            must, in turn, be based upon factual findings sufficiently specific to indicate to the appellate court that the trial court took due regard of the estates, earnings, conditions and accustomed standard of living of both child
                            and parents. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 12, 327 S.E.2d 283 (1985).

                            To comply with subsection (c) of this section, the order for child support must be premised upon the interplay of the trial court's conclusions of law as to the amount of support necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the child and the relative ability
                            of the parties to provide that amount. To support these conclusions of law, the court must also make specific findings of fact so that an appellate court can ascertain whether the judge below gave due regard to the facts of
                            the particular case. Such findings are necessary to an appellate court's determination of whether the judge's order is sufficiently supported by competent evidence. Where the record discloses sufficient evidence to support
                            the findings, it is not the Supreme Court's task to determine de novo the weight and credibility to be given the evidence contained in the record on appeal. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 63</cite>,

                            The trial court must hear evidence and make findings of fact on the parents' income, estates and present reasonable expenses to determine the parties' relative ability to pay.

                            To comply with subsection (c), the trial court is required to make findings of fact with respect to the factors listed in the statute. Holderness v. Holderness, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 370 S.E.2d 602

                            Fact that the record contains evidence from which the necessary findings could have been made does not have the effect of absolving the trial court from the obligation to actually make the required findings concerning the needs of the children and the
                            parties' relative abilities to pay in a case in which a deviation from the guidelines has been requested. Ferguson v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 768 S.E.2d 30 (2014).

                            Trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law demonstrated "due regard" to the factors required by subsection (c), and thus, it did not abuse its discretion in the calculation of a father's child support obligation; the trial court did not abuse
                            its discretion in determining it would not consider a bonus the mother received, and both parties' estates were approximately the same, neither was taking distributions from investments, and neither would be required to deplete
                            his or her assets. Kleoudis v. Kleoudis, - N.C. App. - , 843 S.E.2d 277 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Giving "due regard" to the estates of the parties does not require detailed findings as to the value of each individual asset but requires only that the trial court consider the evidence and make sufficient findings addressing its determination regarding
                            the estates to allow appellate review. Kleoudis v. Kleoudis, - N.C. App. - , 843 S.E.2d 277 (2020).

                            Findings must be based upon competent evidence, and it is not enough that there may be evidence, in the record sufficient to support findings which could have been made. The trial court must itself determine what pertinent facts are actually established
                            by the evidence before it. Atwell v. Atwell, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 328 S.E.2d 47 (1985).

                            Actual Past Expenditures Must Be Found. - To determine the amount of support necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the child for health, education and maintenance, the court must make findings of specific facts as to what actual past expenditures
                            have been. Warner v. Latimer, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 314 S.E.2d 789 (1984).

                            To determine the amount of support necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the child for health, education and maintenance (which are conclusions of law), the court must make findings of specific facts as to what actual past expenditures have been.
                            Where past expenditures are below subsistence, due regard, of course, must be given to meeting the reasonable needs of the child. Steele v. Steele, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 601,

                            Conclusion as to Reasonableness of Personal Expenses. - In a child support case, the trial court should be satisfied that personal expenses itemized in the parties' balance sheets are reasonable under all the circumstances before making a determination
                            of need or liability, and though absence of a specific conclusion as to reasonableness will not necessarily be held for error, the better practice is for the order to contain such a conclusion. Coble v. Coble,

                            The determination of what portion of claimed expenses is reasonable, and what portion is unreasonable, in arriving at an amount necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the child, requires an exercise of judgment and is therefore not a question of fact

                            Appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment ordering a father who was in college to pay $95 per month in child support because the trial court based its order on the father's earning capacity but did not find that the father was deliberately suppressing

                            <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 343 S.E.2d 581 (1986).

                            Where child support for defendant's five children by three different mothers, set pursuant to the guidelines, amounted to 66% of his gross income, the trial court's duty was to determine whether this support exceeded the reasonable needs of each child,
                            whether it was unjust or inappropriate, and whether defendant had "sufficient income to maintain a minimum standard of living based on the 1997 federal poverty level for one person." Buncombe County ex rel. Blair v. Jackson,

                            Award of Reimbursement for Past Support. - The trial court must make specific factual findings to support not only an award of future support but also to support an award of reimbursement for past support of the child. Buff v. Carter,

                            Findings as to Suppression of Income. - The trial court erred in awarding child support based upon each party's "earning capacity" without any findings as to whether either party deliberately suppressed his or her income to avoid his or her support obligation.

                            Finding as to Income of Supporting Spouse. - Although a proper finding pertaining to the income of the supporting spouse must be based on present, as opposed to past, income, there is no rule that requires a specific finding as to the income of the supporting

                            Proper Findings Not Made for Deviation from Guidelines. - Trial court failed to make proper findings when it deviated from the child support guidelines; while the trial court made findings regarding the parties' average monthly incomes, health insurance
                            costs for the child, and work related child care costs for the child, nothing addressed the needs of the child or the parties' ability to pay, and the order failed to meet statutory and case law requirements. Sarno v. Sarno,

                            Findings Held Insufficient. - Where the trial did not make an assessment of the child's needs, and found that plaintiff 's expenses exceeded her income and that her unwieldy credit card obligations were caused by defendant's failure to pay $220 in support
                            to her in a timely manner when she had custody of both children, the findings of fact were insufficient to support the conclusion that plaintiff should not be required to support her minor children; defendant's $220 delinquency
                            in child support payments did not mean that plaintiff 's expenses were reasonable, and the trial judge made no findings upon which to conclude that defendant had the ability to support both children. Payne v. Payne,

                            Appellate court would remand case where the trial court failed to make findings as to what the child support amount would be under the applicable Guidelines, as to the child's reasonable needs, and as to whether the greater weight of the evidence established
                            that application of the presumptive Guidelines amount would be "unjust or inappropriate." Sain v. Sain, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 517 S.E.2d 921 (1999).

                            Trial court's finding that a husband was not under any other child support obligation pursuant to a court order or other written obligation flew in the face of the uncontroverted evidence presented at trial by both parties that was under a district court
                            order to provide child support payments for a child born from his subsequent marriage; thus, the trial court's finding was not supported by competent evidence in the record, was not sufficient to establish that the trial court
                            took due regard of defendant's estates, earnings, conditions and other facts of the particular case as required under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4(c)</a></cite>,

                            Adequate findings did not support a prospective child support order because the trial court did not consider the inheritance of the wife to whom custody was awarded.

                            Findings calculating a mother's capital gains income were insufficient because the findings did not support using the mother's past capital gains to find current capital gains.

                            Trial court's use of a father's historical income to calculate prospective child support in the form of arrears dating back to the filing of the mother's motion to modify child support was in error because the trial court made no finding to support the
                            use of that method; the trial court made no findings providing a rationale for using the father's income for each individual year, rather than using his current income to calculate child support owed back to the filing of the
                            mother's motion. Simms v. Bolger, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 522 (2019).

                            Standard for reviewing child support orders resembles that for reviewing awards of custody, in that the amount of child support allowed by the trial judge will be disturbed only when there is an abuse of discretion. Dixon v. Dixon,
                            <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 73, 312 S.E.2d 669 (1984).

                            No Appellate Jurisdiction to Hear Appeal of Interlocutory Support Order. - Appellate court had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a denial of child support modification because: (1) an order continuing an existing order until legally interdependent
                            custody issues could be heard was interlocutory, as, without knowing the custody arrangement, a trial court could not find which child support worksheet to use, or whether to deviate from the guidelines; (2) the order did not
                            resolve the custody issue; and (3) allowing an appeal would lead to an unnecessary appeal. Gray v. Peele, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 761 S.E.2d 739 (2014).

                            The trial court's consideration of the factors contained in subsection (c) of this section is an exercise in sound judicial discretion, and if its findings are supported by competent evidence in the record, its determination as to the proper amount of
                            support will not be disturbed on appeal. Boyd v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 343 S.E.2d 581 (1986).

                            Even If Evidence Is Conflicting. - An order for child support is a question of fairness to all parties involved. It will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion by the trial judge, even if there is conflicting evidence. Evans v. Craddock,
                            <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 300 S.E.2d 908 (1983).

                            In determining the amount of alimony and child support to be awarded, the trial judge must follow the requirements of this section. The amount is a reasonable subsistence, to be determined by the trial judge in the exercise of a judicial discretion from
                            the evidence before him. His determination is reviewable, but it will not be disturbed in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion. Beall v. Beall, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 669</cite>, 228

                            Finding of Ability to Pay Is Conclusive When Supported by Evidence. - The trial court's discretion as to the amount of child support awarded is not absolute and unreviewable. The order must be based not only on the needs of the child, but also on the
                            ability of the father to meet the needs. But where there is a finding of ability to pay, supported in the record by competent evidence, that finding will be conclusive. Wyatt v. Wyatt, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite>                            162, 231 S.E.2d 42, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 650, 242 S.E.2d 180 (1977).

                            Findings Regarding Standard of Living And Reasonableness of Expenses. - Without findings regarding the child's or parties' accustomed standard of living and the reasonableness of the expenses in light of that standard of living, the court of appeals cannot
                            determine whether the trial court considered the standard of living factor and whether the trial court's finding of reasonable needs is supported by the evidence.

                            Remand for Further Findings. - Where the trial judge found that the reasonable expenses of child were "in excess of $500," while the child's mother claimed that the child's expenses were $855.16, and found the reasonable living expenses of the child's
                            father to be $800, rejecting his claimed figure of $1,196.80, lack of findings as to what claimed expenses of the child or the father the court considered unreasonable would require the appellate court to vacate the order and
                            remand the cause for further findings. Patterson v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 343 S.E.2d 595 (1986).

                            Failure to Assign Error to Trial Court's Findings. - Trial court's consideration of a child's needs, the mother's share of those needs, and the father's contribution to those needs was found to have been reasonable and adequate under circumstances in
                            which the father did not assign error to the trial court's findings; the trial court's finding that the amount in the parties' agreement was inadequate and thus did not influence the trial court's decision, or the trial court's
                            total calculated reasonable expenses. Pascoe v. Pascoe, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 645 S.E.2d 156 (2007).

                            Presumption Allowing Modification. - The presumption, created in a 1994 revision, allowing modification of a child support order which is at least three years old, when there is a disparity of 15% or more between the amount of support payable under the
                            original order and the amount owed based on the parties' current income and expenses, is within the scope of the legislative mandate to ensure adequate child support awards over time. Garrison v. Connor,

                            Court Has Broad Discretion Under Subsection (e). - The court is not limited to ordering one method of payment, to the exclusion of the others provided in subsection (e) of this section. The legislature's use of the disjunctive and the phrase "as the court
                            may order" shows that the court is to have broad discretion in providing for payment of child support orders. Moore v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 748, 242 S.E.2d 642 (1978).

                            Creation of Savings Account for Use of Children. - In an action for child support, the court was without the power to, in effect, attempt to create a savings account for the use of the children after they reached the age of 18. Parrish v. Cole,

                            Trial court erred in directing payment of child support to a custodial account for the child's benefit because that would result in surplus funds being directed to the child upon emancipation, and instead, the funds should have been directed to the benefit
                            of the minor child no differently than in any other child support award; the error in creating a custodial account was not harmless because the purpose of the statute was to provide support for the child prior to emancipation,
                            not after. Simms v. Bolger, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 522 (2019).

                            Receipt of Support May Not Be Conditioned on Visitation. - A trial judge does not have authority to condition a minor child's receipt of support paid by the noncustodial parent on compliance with court-ordered visitation allowed the noncustodial parent
                            by ordering that child support paid by defendant be placed in escrow if minor child fails or refuses to abide by the visitation privileges allowed defendant. Appert v. Appert, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                            27, 341 S.E.2d 342 (1986).

                            the $500.00 plaintiff owed him as a result of an equitable distribution judgment; child support obligations may not be offset by other obligations. Brinkley v. Brinkley, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite>                            608, 522 S.E.2d 90 (1999).

                            Court Had No Authority to Order Payment of Social Security Benefits Directly to Mother. - A North Carolina district court had no authority to order the Social Security Administration and defendant father, a representative payee receiving Social Security
                            disability payments for the benefit of his children, to pay those benefits directly to plaintiff mother. Brevard v. Brevard, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 328 S.E.2d 789 (1985).

                            Defendant did not waive his right to support by failing to schedule notice of a hearing on the issue prior to child's emancipation; trial court was incorrect in its presumption that because the issue of custody had become moot, it could not address the

                            The General Assembly has made statutory provisions in subdivision (f)(2) of this section for awarding possession of a home as a part of child support. This is true without regard to whether the parties are divorced. To the extent that the General Assembly's
                            will, as expressed in this section, conflicts with the common-law principle that the husband is entitled to exclusive possession of entirety property, the common law has been abrogated and supplanted. Martin v. Martin,

                            Award of Personal Property Does Not Require Valuation Of Property. - Because the statute requiring valuation of real property transferred for payment of child support arrearages does not require the trial court to determine the value of personal property
                            applied towards child support arrearages, the father did not offer any support for his contention that such a transfer of personal property was analogous to a transfer of real property, and the father consented to transfer
                            the vehicle to the mother, the trial court did not err by transferring the vehicle to the mother without making a specific finding as to its value. Respess v. Respess, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite>                            611, 754 S.E.2d 691 (2014).

                            the arrearages to a judgment and to make provisions for period payments towards the arrearages; thus, the judgment was not void and could not be set aside. Duplin County DSS v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite>                            480, 751 S.E.2d 621 (2013).

                            Court cannot agree with the conclusion that the statute is vague and did not authorize periodic payments towards the father's child support arrearages.

                            Retroactive Distinguished from Prospective. - Child support awarded prior to the time a party files a complaint is properly classified as retroactive child support and is determined by considering reasonably necessary expenditures made on behalf of the
                            child by the party seeking retroactive child support and the defendant's ability to pay during the period in the past for which reimbursement is sought; child support awarded from the time a party files a complaint for child
                            support to the date of trial is not "retroactive child support," but is in the nature of prospective child support representing that period from the time a complaint seeking child support is filed to the date of trial. Taylor
                            v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 455 S.E.2d 442 (1995), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 50</cite>, 468 S.E.2d 33 (1996).

                        <p>
                            Although prospective child support based upon the presumptive guidelines requires no factual findings regarding the child's reasonable needs or the supporting parent's ability to pay, the trial court must set out specific findings of fact in a reimbursement
                            award for retroactive support. Biggs v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 524 S.E.2d 577 (2000).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court's award of child support was not retroactive in nature because prior consent order was not intended as a final determination on the issue of child support; thus, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4(c)</a></cite>,
                            the trial court properly followed the guidelines in awarding prospective child support. Cole v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 562 S.E.2d 11 (2002).

                            Claim for Retroactive Child Support. - Not only may an action be brought to collect child support payments in arrears, but a claim for retroactive child support may be brought under this section. Warner v. Latimer, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite>                            170, 314 S.E.2d 789 (1984).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Retroactive child support is based solely on amount actually expended for support of minor children during time period in question. Cohen v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 396 S.E.2d 344 (1990).

                        <p>
                            "Emergency Situation" Must Be Shown. - Child support reimbursement, or child support governing a period prior to a motion to increase an existing child support order, would constitute retroactive child support and would not be based on the presumptive
                            guidelines. Therefore, a child support payment order may not be retroactively increased without evidence of some emergency situation that required the expenditure of sums in excess of the amount of child support paid. Biggs
                            v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 524 S.E.2d 577 (2000).

                            Reasonable Necessity and Ability to Pay Must Be Considered. - When a trial court is faced with calculating a retroactive child support award, it must consider, among other things, whether what was actually expended was "reasonably necessary" for the child's
                            support and the defendant's ability to pay during the time for which reimbursement is sought. Buff v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 145, 331 S.E.2d 705 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Retroactive Support for Private Schooling Denied. - Award of additional retroactive child support for private schooling was denied where the trial court's limited findings failed to set forth the existence of a "sudden emergency" so unusual or extraordinary
                            as to require plaintiff to expend sums in excess of defendant's existing support obligation, and the court's order contained no findings reflective of defendant's ability to pay during the period the emergency expenses were
                            allegedly incurred. Biggs v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 524 S.E.2d 577 (2000).

                            Measure of Liability for Reimbursement of Support Funds Expended. - Where there was no evidence or finding as to the actual amount expended by plaintiff for the support of the children for which she was entitled to reimbursement from defendant, what the
                            defendant "should have paid" was not the measure of his liability to plaintiff. The measure of defendant's liability to plaintiff was the amount actually expended by plaintiff which represented the defendant's share of support.

                            No Reimbursement for Share of Support Paid by Court Order. - In an action by a mother for child support, mother was not entitled to be reimbursed for sums expended by her for the support of the children which represented her share of support as determined
                            by the trial judge, considering the relative ability of the parties to provide support. Hicks v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 237 S.E.2d 307 (1977).

                            Mother's Homemaking Services Considered. - In determining father's share of the reasonable actual expenditures made by mother during the period for which retroactive child support is sought, the trial court must consider her child care and homemaking
                            services rendered during this period. Lawrence v. Tise, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 419 S.E.2d 176 (1992).

                            Mother Not Entitled to Compensation for Support by Others. - In an action by a mother for child support, she was not entitled to be compensated for support for the children which was provided by others. Hicks v. Hicks,
                            <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 237 S.E.2d 307 (1977).

                        <p>
                            Extent of Recovery for Past Expenditures. - Assuming adequate proof of the expenditures under subsection (c) of this section, the plaintiff-mother could recover reimbursement for her past support expenditures (1) to the extent she paid the father's share
                            of such expenditures, and (2) to the extent the expenditures occurred three years or less before August 8, 1986, the date she filed her claim for child support. Napowsa v. Langston, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite>                            14, 381 S.E.2d 882, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 709</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 460 (1989).

                            Error Where Court Used Guidelines Instead of Actual Expenditures. - Where, although the trial court made a finding on mother's actual expenditures during the period for which retroactive support was sought, the court instead based the retroactive support
                            award on the guidelines in effect at the time the expenses were incurred by mother, this was error requiring reversal of the order of retroactive support. Lawrence v. Tise, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite>                            140, 419 S.E.2d 176 (1992).

                        <p>
                            Proof of Actual Expenditures. - Trial court's award of retroactive child support had to be reversed and remanded for findings on the mother's actual expenditures for the children during the relevant time period. Respess v. Respess,
                            <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 611, 754 S.E.2d 691 (2014).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trial court was under no obligation to render findings of fact where it did not deviate from the presumptive guidelines, but rather adjusted the guideline amounts to account, prospectively, for the extraordinary expense of private schooling. Biggs
                            v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 524 S.E.2d 577 (2000).

                        <p>
                            Where the trial court abused its discretion in calculating plaintiff's income and in failing to value plaintiff's estate, and erred in using the "retroactive child support" test for calculating prospective child support, case would be remanded. Taylor
                            v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 455 S.E.2d 442 (1995), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 50</cite>, 468 S.E.2d 33 (1996).

                        <p>
                            Evidence Held Sufficient to Support Award. - Where trial court specifically found that prior to filing action plaintiff expended at least four hundred dollars ($400.00) per month for the support of the parties' child and that defendant had the capacity
                            to pay one-half of this amount toward the child's support during this time, the findings were supported by the evidence and were binding on appeal; the trial court correctly awarded plaintiff reimbursement for past child support.
                            Rawls v. Rawls, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 381 S.E.2d 179 (1989).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the father had been found to be in contempt due to his failure to pay child support, the trial court made sufficient findings of fact to support an award of attorney's fees to the mother under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.6" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.6</a></cite>,
                            despite the fact that there was no finding that the mother was an interested party with insufficient means to defray the cost of the litigation; under

                            <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To constitute willful disobedience there must be an ability to comply with the court order and a deliberate and intentional failure to do so. Bennett v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 204 S.E.2d 554
                            (1974).

                        <p>
                            One does not act willfully in failing to comply with a judgment if it has not been within his power to do so since the judgment was rendered. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                            Ability to Pay or to Take Measures to Do So Required. - Although an order for child support is enforceable by civil contempt proceedings, a supporting party cannot be held in contempt unless the party willfully failed to comply with the support order.
                            A finding of willful failure to comply with the order requires evidence of the present ability to pay or to take reasonable measures to comply. Brower v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite>                            425, 331 S.E.2d 170 (1985).

                            Contempt for Violation Based on Willfulness Upheld. - Trial court acted correctly when it exercised jurisdiction under this section and found defendant/husband in civil contempt, where he made a calculated and deliberate decision to pay a lower amount
                            of child support than it had previously ordered. Burnett v. Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 316, 515 S.E.2d 480 (1999).

                            Trial Court Must Make Particular Findings of Ability to Pay. - In order to hold a parent in contempt for failure to pay child support in accordance with a decree, the failure must be willful. In order to find the failure willful, there must be particular
                            findings of the ability to pay during the period of delinquency. Goodson v. Goodson, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 231 S.E.2d 178 (1977).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to punish by contempt proceedings, the trial court must find as a fact that the defendant possessed the means to comply with orders of the court during the period when he was in default. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There must be a specific finding of fact, supported by competent evidence, to the effect that defendant possesses the means to comply with the court order, before he can be incarcerated for contempt until compliance. Bennett v. Bennett,
                            <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 204 S.E.2d 554 (1974); Fitch v. Fitch, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 216 S.E.2d 734, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 240</cite>, 217 S.E.2d 679 (1975).

                        <p>
                            A defendant may not deliberately divest himself of his property and in effect pauperize himself for appearance at a hearing for contempt and thereby escape punishment because he is at that time unable to comply with the court order. Bennett v. Bennett,
                            <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 204 S.E.2d 554 (1974).

                        <p>
                            Defendant's voluntary purging of assets in bankruptcy was considered a deliberate divestment of assets; therefore, failure to comply with a child support order was willful and punishable by contempt proceedings. Harris v. Harris,
                            <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 699, 373 S.E.2d 312 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Past contempt cannot be ignored by the court even if at the exact time of the contempt hearing the defendant does not have the means to comply with the order for child support. Bennett v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite>                            390, 204 S.E.2d 554 (1974).

                            Contempt Decree Set Aside for Lack of Findings. - Where the lower court had not found as a fact that defendant possessed the means to comply with the orders for payment of subsistence pendente lite at any time during the period when he was in default
                            in such payments, the findings that defendant's failure to make the payments of subsistence was deliberate and willful was not supported by the record, and the decree committing him to imprisonment for contempt would be set
                            aside. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Child Support Arrears. - Although defendant's child support obligation terminated because her son turned 18 and was no longer in school, the arrears owed to the county remained in force, as defendant made no child support payments before her son turned
                            18 and the court found the purpose of the order would be served by her compliance; her challenge to be held in civil contempt failed. Cumberland Cty. ex rel. Mitchell v. Manning, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite>                            383, 822 S.E.2d 305 (2018).

                            When order reducing child support arrears to a money judgment does not provide for periodic payments although the lower court's prior judgment reduced the father's child support arrearage to a money judgment, it did not provide for periodic payments so
                            his failure to satisfy the arrearage was enforceable by execution under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Xa28s1-302" target="_blank">G.S. 1-302</a></cite>, and not civil

                            When order reducing child support arrears to a money judgment does not provide for periodic payments or other deadline for payment, it is not enforceable by contempt, and the trial court does not have jurisdiction to enter an order finding a defendant
                            in contempt. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 615 S.E.2d 39 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 60</cite>, 621 S.E.2d 175 (2005).

                            Review of Facts Found in Contempt Proceedings. - In proceedings for contempt, the facts found by the judge are not reviewable, except for the purpose of passing upon their sufficiency to warrant the judgment. Cox v. Cox,

                            Payment of Counsel Fees. - The court is vested with broad power when it is authorized to punish "as for contempt." This power includes the authority for a district court judge to require one whom he has found in willful contempt of court for failure to
                            comply with a child support order to pay reasonable counsel fees to opposing counsel as a condition to being purged of contempt. Blair v. Blair, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 173 S.E.2d

                            Attorney Fees Included In Child Support Award. - Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to enforce attorney fee awards included in a child support award during the pendency of defendant's appeal of a child support award pursuant to
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4ol1f9" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4(f)(9)</a></cite>. Moreover, where defendant made no attempt to post an undertaking or supersedeas bond to stay civil contempt proceedings on the
                            attorney fee awards pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-289" target="_blank">G.S. 1-289</a></cite>, defendant was subject to civil contempt proceedings pending his appeal. Simms v.

                        <p>
                            Indefinite Jail Term. - When a defendant has the present means to comply with a court order and deliberately refuses to comply, there is a present and continuing contempt, and the court may commit such defendant to jail for an indefinite term, that is,
                            until he complies with the order. Bennett v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 204 S.E.2d 554 (1974); Fitch v. Fitch, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 216 S.E.2d

                            Effect of Dismissal of Contempt Action Without Explanation. - A dismissal of a contempt action, without explanation, at most signified that the supporting party was not in contempt as of that date and did not cancel the accrued child support debt; it
                            merely forced the custodial parent or an authorized party to pursue one of the alternate remedies listed in subsection (f) to enforce the debt. Brower v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite>                            425, 331 S.E.2d 170 (1985).

                            Failure to Identify Purpose of Support as Health, Education and Maintenance Is Not Error. - The better practice is for the court's order to relate that the payment ordered under this section is the amount necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the
                            child for health, education, and maintenance, but the failure of the court to do so does not constitute reversible error. Andrews v. Andrews, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 410, 183 S.E.2d

                            finding the husband in contempt based on the exception to the divestment of the trial court's jurisdiction found in G.S.50-13.4(f)(9). Guerrier v. Guerrier, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite>                            154, 574 S.E.2d 69 (2002).

                            Medical Child Support Enforcement Provisions. - The medical child support enforcement provisions of House Bill 1563, 1993 (Reg. Sess., 1994), N.C. Session Laws c. 644, are inapplicable to the North Carolina Teachers' and State Employees' Comprehensive
                            Major Medical Plan (now State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees) and the governmental entities whose employees and retirees, along with their dependents, are eligible for coverage under the Plan or its HMO option.
                            Medical child support orders nonetheless may be enforced directly against State employees and retirees who fail to enroll, or maintain coverage for, their eligible dependent children under the State Health Plan in accordance

                            Remarriage Does Not Reduce Choice of Procedures. - The statutory scheme of this section provides for an election of procedures in actions for custody or support; there is no reason why the remarriage of the parties should reduce the choices available.

                            Effect of Defendant's Petition for Custody on Plaintiff's Right to Voluntary Nonsuit. - Where wife instituted action for divorce and husband filed his petition in the cause praying the court for a determination of his custodial rights with respect to
                            the child, thus seeking affirmative relief of a substantial nature, it was not within the power of the clerk to divest the court of its jurisdiction by allowing wife to submit to a voluntary nonsuit during the course of the
                            hearings and while the issue of custody was in fieri before the presiding judge. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 528</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 879 (1957).

                            failure to pay child support, regardless of the judge's claim that his actions were allowed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.5" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.5</a></cite>. In re Royster,

                            Burden of Proof. - Even if privity was not a requirement of collateral estoppel, the trial court erroneously applied the doctrine because of the different burdens of proof used in custody and neglect hearings, and the trial court erred in applying the
                            doctrine to bar the mother's questions, as the neglect hearing was held pursuant to a different burden of proof; the error made it impossible for the mother to effectively contest the allegations made in the petition under
                            the higher, clear and convincing evidence standard, and the matter was reversed. In re K.A., <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 756 S.E.2d 837 (2014).

                            As an Additional Method of Determining Issues as to Children. - The 1953 amendment of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>, granting jurisdiction to determine custody in an
                            action for alimony without divorce, created an additional method whereby the matter of custody may be determined. Blankenship v. Blankenship, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 638</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 857 (1962).

                            The 1955 amendment to former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>, which provided that custody orders were authorized "in the same manner as such orders are entered by the court in
                            an action for divorce," bolstered the decision in Blankenship v. Blankenship, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 638</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 857 (1962), which held that that section created an additional method whereby all questions
                            relating to custody and child support were brought into and determined in the suit for alimony without divorce, in one action. In re Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 180</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 327 (1967).

                            Counterclaims. - There is no conflict between the statutes dealing with procedure in divorce actions and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 13(a). Rather

                            Divorce action is pending for purposes of determining custody and support until the death of one of the parties or until the youngest child born of the marriage reaches maturity, whichever event occurs first. Latham v. Latham,

                            Remedy of Plaintiff in Divorce Suit Is by Motion in the Cause. - Where a wife institutes suit for divorce, her remedy to require the defendant to provide support for a minor child of the marriage is by motion in the cause, which may be filed either before
                            or after final judgment. Winfield v. Winfield, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 256</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 259 (1947).

                        <p>
                            Plaintiff-husband, as a parent seeking custody, could seek to have his child support obligation determined through a motion in the cause in the divorce action. He was not precluded from doing so by the fact that the court had not previously entered orders
                            in that action relating to child support. Bottomley v. Bottomley, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 346 S.E.2d 317 (1986).

                            Modification of Order on Motion of Court or Party. - Upon motion of a party, or upon its own motion after due notice, the court may conduct a hearing to determine whether the decree should be modified. Spence v. Durham,

                            Foster Parents May Not Bring Custody Action. - Nothing in the language of G.S. 48-9.1(1) gives foster parents standing to contest the department's or agency's exercise of its rights as legal custodian; therefore, foster parents are without standing to
                            bring an action seeking custody of minor child placed in their home by defendant. Oxendine v. Department of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 370 (1981); In re

                            Intervention by Foster Parents. - In proceeding brought by DSS in which custody was put in issue by guardian ad litem and natural father, trial court did not err in permitting child's foster parents to intervene. In re Scearce,
                            <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 345 S.E.2d 404, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 415</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 589 (1986), distinguishing Oxendine v. Department of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>,

                            Guardianship Versus Custody. - When a stepmother was granted ex parte temporary custody of orphaned stepchildren, an aunt's subsequent guardianship petition made the custody action moot because, (1) in the guardianship case, the clerk properly exercised
                            jurisdiction, as the children had no natural guardian, and the clerk's jurisdiction was not divested by the ex parte temporary custody order, since the clerk considered other courts' custody awards, so the clerk had jurisdiction
                            to appoint the children's general guardians, an incident of which was physical custody, and (2) any guardianship modification, including custody modification, required filing a motion with the clerk instead of a district court
                            custody action. Corbett v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 40, 795 S.E.2d 564 (2016).

                            Divorce Action Gives Court Jurisdiction of Custody. - In divorce actions, whether for the dissolution of the marriage or from bed and board, the court in which the action is brought acquires jurisdiction over the custody of the unemancipated children
                            of the parties. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 72</cite>, 145 S.E.2d 332 (1965).

                            When Jurisdiction Is Obtained Over Defendant. - Upon the institution of a divorce action, the court is vested with jurisdiction of the children of the marriage for the purpose of entering orders respecting their care and custody. But the action is not
                            instituted, within the meaning of this rule, until and unless the court acquires jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, and jurisdiction is subject to the fundamental requirement of notice and opportunity to be heard.
                            If both parents are in court and subject to its jurisdiction, an order may be entered, in proper instances, binding the parties and enforceable through the court's coercive jurisdiction. Coble v. Coble,

                            And Consent Judgment Therein Does Not Divest Court of Jurisdiction as to Custody of Child. - Upon the institution of an action for divorce from bed and board, the court acquires jurisdiction of the minor children of the parties, which is not divested
                            by a consent judgment on the issue of divorce entered in the cause with approval of the court, especially where such consent judgment expressly provides that either party may thereafter make a motion in the cause for the custody
                            of the children, the court having the power in an action for divorce, either absolute or from bed and board, before or after final judgment, to enter orders respecting the care and custody of the children under this section.
                            Tyner v. Tyner, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 776</cite>, 175 S.E. 144 (1934).

                        <p>
                            Where consent judgment in a suit a mensa et thoro has been entered in the action, without providing for the children, upon motion in the original cause the court has the power to make such further orders as it deems proper requiring the father (or mother)
                            to provide for the support of his children, whether born before or after the rendition of the consent judgment. Sanders v. Sanders, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 317</cite>, 83 S.E. 489 (1914).

                            Actions Constituting General Appearance Subject Defendant to Jurisdiction. - By submitting information to the court relevant to the merits in action for child custody and support, defendant made a general appearance prior to his assertions of lack of
                            personal jurisdiction where defendant sought affirmative relief from the court; submission of the documents was inconsistent with defendant's later claim of lack of personal jurisdiction. Bullard v. Bader,

                            Previous Action Pending. - Husband's motion as to child custody and child support was properly dismissed where the wife's previously commenced action with respect to the custody and support of the children was pending at the time the husband filed his
                            motion. Basinger v. Basinger, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 342 S.E.2d 549 (1986).

                            In a grandmother's action seeking custody of her grandchildren, the trial court erred in changing venue because either the county where the complaint alleged that the children resided or the county where they were physically present could have proper
                            venue; basing venue on the physical presence of the children would seem entirely appropriate, particularly where a grandparent is seeking to protect grandchildren whose parents have disappeared. Zetino-Cruz v. Benitez-Zetino,

                            Jurisdiction Vests Exclusively in Divorce Court. - The court in which a suit for divorce is pending has exclusive jurisdiction as to the care or custody of the children of the marriage, before and after the decree of divorce has been entered. In re Blake,
                            <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 278</cite>, 114 S.E. 294 (1922); Murphy v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 95</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 148 (1964).

                        <p>
                            When a divorce action is instituted, jurisdiction over the custody of the children born of the marriage vests exclusively in the court before whom the divorce action is pending and becomes a concomitant part of the subject matter of the court's jurisdiction
                            in the divorce action. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 528</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 879 (1957); In re Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 180</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 327 (1967).

                            Jurisdiction over the custody of the children born of the marriage rests exclusively in the court before whom the divorce action is pending, and no order for the custody of the children may be entered in a later action by one of the parties for subsistence
                            without divorce. Reece v. Reece, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 321</cite>, 56 S.E.2d 641 (1949), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 95</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 363 (1950).

                            Where plaintiff instituted his action for divorce from bed and board in the superior court, and specifically prayed "that the court determine the proper custody for the aforesaid minor child of the plaintiff and defendant," that court became vested in
                            his suit with exclusive jurisdiction to enter orders respecting the care, custody and maintenance of the child. Bunn v. Bunn, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 445</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 792 (1963).

                            Jurisdiction of the matters relating to custody having been invoked in an action for divorce, the court in which the divorce action was pending would have exclusive jurisdiction over the question of custody. Blankenship v. Blankenship,

                            Jurisdiction Continues After Entry of Decree. - The court in which the suit for divorce is pending has exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings for custody and child support, and once they are commenced, maintains it after the divorce decree is entered.
                            Bass v. Bass, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 258 S.E.2d 391 (1979).

                        <p>
                            Jurisdiction of courts in custody and visitation cases is continuous. A decree determines only the present rights with respect to such custody and is subject to judicial alteration or modification upon a change of circumstances affecting the welfare of
                            the child. In re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 302 S.E.2d 259 (1983).

                            The jurisdiction of the court over the custody of unemancipated children of the parties in a divorce action continues even after divorce. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 72</cite>, 145 S.E.2d 332 (1965).

                            Once jurisdiction of the court attaches to a child custody matter, it exists for all time until the cause is fully and completely determined. In re Scearce, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 345 S.E.2d 404, cert.

                            Where Custody and Support Have Been Brought to Issue. - Where custody and support are brought to issue by the pleadings, the court retains continuing jurisdiction over these matters even when the issues are not determined by the judgment. Thus, where
                            the issues of custody and support were raised in plaintiff wife's complaint and ruled on by the trial judge, the court retained jurisdiction to entertain and rule on defendant husband's motion in the cause for custody and support
                            of the children. Jackson v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 315 S.E.2d 90 (1984).

                            Until Death of a Party or Children's Attainment of Age of Majority. - A divorce action is pending for purposes of determining custody and support until the death of one of the parties or until the youngest child born of the marriage reaches the age of
                            majority, whichever event shall first occur. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 378, 188 S.E.2d 711 (1972); Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite>                            222, 256 S.E.2d 302 (1979).

                            But Custody Jurisdiction of Court Where Action for Alimony Without Divorce Is Pending Is Not Lost. - The general rule that exclusive custody jurisdiction is vested in the divorce court is subject to the exception that a court before which an action for
                            alimony without divorce is pending does not lose its custody jurisdiction to the court of another county in which an action for divorce is subsequently filed. In re Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 180</cite>,

                            Institution of a divorce action did not oust the jurisdiction of another court, previously acquired in an action for alimony without divorce, to determine the rights of custody of the children of the marriage. Blankenship v. Blankenship,

                            Divorce Court May Hear and Determine Questions of Custody and Support. - Upon institution of a divorce action the court acquires jurisdiction over any child born of the marriage, and may hear and determine questions both as to the custody and as to the
                            maintenance of such child either before or after final decree of divorce. Story v. Story, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 114</cite>, 19 S.E.2d 136 (1942).

                            After the filing of a complaint in any action for divorce, whether from the bonds of matrimony or from bed and board, both before and after final judgment therein, it is lawful for the judge to make such orders respecting the care, custody, tuition and
                            maintenance of the minor children of the marriage as may be proper. Coggins v. Coggins, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 765</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 700 (1963).

                            And May Grant Custody to Either Parent. - The court has jurisdiction to enter an order granting custody to either of the children's parents, both of whom are subject to the court's jurisdiction.

                            Even Though Such Questions Were Not Raised or Determined in Final Judgment. - A court in which a divorce action was tried has jurisdiction to determine custody and support of children of the marriage, even though no custody or support questions were raised
                            prior to, or determined in, the final judgment of divorce. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 378, 188 S.E.2d 711 (1972).

                            Issue of Custody and Support Remains in Fieri. - If the custody and support has been brought to issue or determined in the previously instituted action between the parents, there could be no final judgment in that case, because the issue of custody and
                            support remains in fieri until the children have become emancipated. Wilson v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 181 S.E.2d 190 (1971); Kennedy v.

                            Jurisdiction to Modify Custody Decree. - Once a court in this State properly asserts jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties to custody of a minor child, that court retains jurisdiction to modify its custody decree upon a showing of a substantial
                            change of circumstances. Lynch v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 367</cite>, 279 S.E.2d 840 (1981).

                        <p>
                            Subsection (f) of this section does not affect the situation where custody and support have already been determined and one of the parties seeks a modification. In such a case, the court first obtaining jurisdiction retains jurisdiction to the exclusion
                            of all other courts and is the only proper court in which to bring an action for the modification of an order establishing custody and support. Tate v. Tate, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite>                            681, 177 S.E.2d 455 (1970).

         Uniform Interstate Family Support Act.
        </b> - Where a North Carolina judgment of absolute divorce made no provision for child support, and there was thus no existing order, the Texas Attorney General's petition to establish a support obligation was properly
                            classified as a petition to establish an order of support rather than a petition to modify an order of no support; thus, under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the Texas trial court had the authority to adjudicate
                            the father's child support obligation, and because the North Carolina tribunal had not acquired continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, the trial court erred in granting the father's plea to the jurisdiction. Office of the AG of

                            (b), makes it clear that after final judgment in a previously instituted action between the parents, where custody and support has not been brought to issue or determined, the custody and support issue may be determined in
                            an independent action in another court. Kennedy v. Surratt, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 404, 224 S.E.2d 215 (1976).

                            Same - Before Final Judgment. - When a divorce action has been filed in one county, and there has not been a final judgment in that action, the courts of another county are, by virtue of the first proviso in subsection (f) of this section, without jurisdiction

                            Jurisdiction to Award Custody of Child After Denial of Divorce. - After plaintiff's suit for divorce from bed and board and defendant's cross action for alimony without divorce had both been denied, the judge had jurisdiction and power to enter the portion
                            of the judgment awarding custody of the minor son of the parties to defendant and providing for his maintenance and support. Bunn v. Bunn, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 445</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 792

                            Added Parties May Be Subjected to Jurisdiction to Same Extent as Original Parties. - In an action to determine custody of a child, an order which was entered in the Court of Appeals making the paternal grandparents parties, pursuant to their motion, subjected
                            them to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals and of the trial court to the same extent as if they had been original parties plaintiff. Brandon v. Brandon, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            457, 179 S.E.2d 177 (1971).

                            Failure to Raise Issue of Venue. - Because a mother and father, defendants, never appeared or filed an answer, they made no objection to venue and, thus, they waived it. Zetino-Cruz v. Benitez-Zetino, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite>                            218, 791 S.E.2d 100 (2016).

                            Failure to Raise Issue of Child Support. - Defendant's mere mentioning of "a Separation Agreement dated June 5, 1981" in his 1982 divorce complaint was insufficient to raise the issue of child support. Defendant's divorce complaint did not ask the divorce
                            court to review the question of child support and the divorce judgment did not even allude to the parties' separation agreement; therefore, defendant's contention that his prior divorce action placed the question of child support
                            at issue with the results that (i) the original divorce court retained jurisdiction over that question and (ii) the present independent action by his wife should have been dismissed under a theory of abatement, was rejected.

                            Effect of Subsequent Divorce in Another State. - Where the children of the marriage were residents of this State and the parents were personally before the court, the courts of this State had jurisdiction in the wife's action for subsistence under former

                            for contempt for willful failure to comply with its order, notwithstanding the fact that the husband obtained a decree of divorce in another state after the entry of the order for support. Whitford v. Whitford, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 353</cite>,

                            Judge Held Without Jurisdiction to Hear Matter Outside District. - Upon application for the custody of the children of the marriage after decree of divorce, the resident judge entered a temporary order awarding custody to the father, and issued an order
                            to defendant wife to appear outside the county and outside the district to show cause why the temporary order should not be made permanent. It was held that the judge was without jurisdiction to hear the matter outside the
                            district, and an order issued upon the hearing of the order to show cause was void ab initio. Patterson v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 481</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 658 (1949).

                            Jurisdiction over Petition Filed by DSS. - The district court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of petition filed, signed and verified by county division of social services, which alleged that child had been placed with DSS by its mother; that
                            the putative father was unknown; that North Carolina was the home state of the child and no other state had jurisdiction over the child; and that the best interest of the child would be served if the court assumed jurisdiction

                            Transfer of Venue. - For the convenience of witnesses and parties and because it may be in the best interests of justice and the parties, the court of original venue may, in its discretion, transfer the venue of an ongoing action for custody or support
                            to a more appropriate county. Broyhill v. Broyhill, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 147, 343 S.E.2d 605 (1986).

                            Standing to Intervene. - As a grandmother failed to allege conduct sufficient to support a finding that the parents engaged in conduct inconsistent with their parental rights and responsibilities, she could not overcome the presumption that the parents
                            had the superior right to the care, custody, and control of the child, and lacked standing to intervene. Perdue v. Fuqua, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 673 S.E.2d 145 (2009).

                            Nature of Inquiry as to Full Faith and Credit. - In a proceeding to determine whether a custody judgment is entitled to full faith and credit, the court's inquiry is first confined to whether the judgment sought to be enforced was a final judgment rendered
                            by a court with competent jurisdiction. If the court determines that the foreign judgment was final and was rendered by a court with proper jurisdiction, then the judgment is entitled to full faith and credit, and the court
                            never reaches the merits of the custody action, unless one of the parties asserts that the judgment should be modified due to a substantial change in circumstances. Lynch v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 367</cite>,

                            When a court asserts jurisdiction to enforce a custody judgment of another state and no showing of a substantial change of circumstances is made, its jurisdiction terminates upon a final judgment awarding full faith and credit to the sister state's decree.

                            Indiana Order for Child Support Given Full Faith and Credit. - Although there was no jurisdictional rule requiring the trial court to dismiss plaintiff father's North Carolina action seeking definition of his child support obligations simply because defendant
                            mother had filed an action in Indiana, where, when plaintiff's motion came on for hearing, the Indiana court had already entered an order on the issue of child support, that order was entitled to full faith and credit in this
                            State as long as plaintiff was not denied due process of law in the Indiana court's assertion of jurisdiction over him. Lynch v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 386 S.E.2d 607

                            Request for Variance for Child Support Guidelines. - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4</a></cite> does not identify any time restrictions for making the request for a hearing. However,
                            to effectuate the purpose of that statute, any party in a pending action requesting a variance from the guidelines must, unless the request is made in the original pleadings, give at least ten days written notice as required
                            by this section. Browne v. Browne, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 617, 400 S.E.2d 736 (1991).

                            Absent a timely and proper request for a variance of the guidelines, support set consistent with the guidelines was conclusively presumed to be in such amount as to meet the reasonable needs of the child for health, education, and maintenance. Browne

                            Because the trial court elected to deny a father's motion requesting a deviation from the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines in its discretion, rather than dismiss it as untimely, the court of appeals did not need to address the timeliness of the
                            motion. Simms v. Bolger, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 522 (2019).

                            Trial court's temporary custody order in an action filed by the child's putative father was not valid because the child's presumed father was not given notice, even though, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.5ol1e3" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.5(e)(3)</a></cite>,
                            in the discretion of the court, failure of service of notice would not affect the validity of an order; that provision only applied to orders entered with respect to support actions.

                            Adequacy of Notice. - Trial court's judgment to modify a child custody award and award sole custody of the minor children to the mother was affirmed because the father admitted that he was on actual notice that a motion to modify custody was set to be
                            heard, but was continued to some date in the future in order to accommodate his need to find new counsel. In addition, he had actual notice of the scheduled court date for the hearing days prior to leaving for a planned vacation,
                            but chose to proceed with the trip rather than attend the hearing; therefore, he had adequate notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard. Trivette v. Trivette, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>                            55, 590 S.E.2d 298 (2004).

                            to comply with the provision of prior orders entered in the case. Anderson v. Lackey, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 593 S.E.2d 87 (2004).

                            In a wife's action for alimony without divorce and for custody and support of the children, a trial court properly removed the case from the trial docket when the wife abandoned her claim to alimony, and the defendant was not entitled to a jury trial

                            And Affidavits Are Not Admissible to Establish Material Facts in Custody Proceedings. - The question to be determined in child custody hearings is certainly as important as any presented in the usual contract or tort litigation. Affidavits are not, as
                            a rule, admissible in the trial of contract and tort cases as independent evidence to establish facts material to the issues being tried, and there is no more justification for resort to inferior evidence in child custody proceedings
                            than in such other litigations. In re Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 170 S.E.2d 84 (1969).

                            But a party to a child custody proceeding must object when affidavits are offered or ask permission to cross-examine, or else his silence will be deemed to give consent. By implication, if timely objection is made, affidavits should not be received, at
                            least not without affording an opportunity for cross-examination. In re Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 170 S.E.2d 84 (1969).

        </b> - Trial court erred in determining a June 2010 temporary custody order had, by operation of time, become a permanent custody order because the temporary order did not determine the issue of visitation, and a permanent
                            custody hearing was set in less than twelve months from the entry of the temporary order; the father would not have been entitled to any visitation with the children if the temporary order had become the permanent order. Woodring

                            Visitation rights should not be permitted to jeopardize a child's welfare. In re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 302 S.E.2d 259 (1983).

                            Trial court is not required to make specific findings to support a visitation schedule whenever a party contends the frequency of visitation is not reasonable. Raynor v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 724,

                            Visitation and child support rights are independent rights accruing primarily to the benefit of the minor child and one is not, and may not be made, contingent upon the other.

                            Receipt of Support May Not Be Conditioned on Visitation. - A trial judge does not have authority to condition a minor child's receipt of support paid by the noncustodial parent on compliance with court-ordered visitation allowed the noncustodial parent
                            by ordering that child support paid by defendant be placed in escrow if minor child fails or refuses to abide by the visitation privileges allowed defendant. Appert v. Appert, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                            27, 341 S.E.2d 342 (1986).

                            that is, by contempt proceedings and by injunction. Appert v. Appert, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 27, 341 S.E.2d 342 (1986).

                            Presumption In Custody Disputes Between Two Parents. - North Carolina Supreme Court also expressly overrules Moore v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 569, 587 S.E.2d 74 (2003), and any other Court of Appeals
                            decisions purporting to apply the Petersen v. Rogers presumption in custody disputes between two parents. Routten v. Routten, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 571</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 154 (2020).

                            Abandonment as Ground to Deny Visitation Rights. - The general rule is that abandonment, by itself, does not constitute sufficient ground to deny visitation rights completely, and this rule is in accord with the principle adopted by the courts that the
                            purpose of denying custody or visitation rights is not to punish the noncustodial parent. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 263 S.E.2d 822 (1980).

                            Contingent Termination of Visitation. - Where the trial judge had ample evidence before him to justify a conclusion that mother had purposefully engaged in a course of conduct designed to alienate the child's affections for his father, and that these
                            actions were detrimental to the child's welfare, he did not abuse his discretion in fashioning an order directing termination of mother's visitation privilege, pending a court hearing, applicable only on the happening of a
                            certain condition (a repetition of that course of conduct), designed to prevent further harm to the child from this type of behavior. Woncik v. Woncik, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 244,

                            Temporary Suspension of Visitation Rights. - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in a child custody matter, in which primary physical custody of the parties' children was awarded to the father, by temporarily suspending the mother's visitation with
                            the children pending their completion of a reunification program designed to repair the children's relationship with the father, which the trial court found had been damaged by the mother's alienating behaviors. Sneed v. Sneed,

                            Conditions on Parental Visitation. - Trial court erred in granting a father the exclusive authority to decide when, where, and if the mother had visitation and to decide under whose supervision the mother had visitation because giving the father the exclusive
                            control over the mother's visitation could result in a complete denial of the mother's right, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.5ol1i" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.5(i)</a></cite>, and delegated
                            a judicial function to the father. Woodring v. Woodring, - N.C. App. - , 742 S.E.2d 295 (2013).

                            Restrictions on Visitation Rights. - Trial court did not err in making its visitation determinations based upon its inability to determine the noncustodial parent's fitness as a parent, mainly because of the parent's refusal to testify regarding the child
                            pornography allegations. The court stated in its order that it would revisit the issue of visitation once the parent obtained a psychological evaluation and a parenting assessment, and once the court obtained the results of
                            forensic evaluation of the material recovered from the parent's computer. Meadows v. Meadows, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 782 S.E.2d 561 (2016).

                            Findings Required Where Severe Restrictions Are Placed on Visitation Rights. - Where severe restrictions are placed on a parent's visitation rights with his child, there should be some finding of fact, supported by competent evidence in the record, warranting
                            such restrictions. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 263 S.E.2d 822 (1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where hostilities exist between estranged parents, it may be difficult for the noncustodial parent to maintain a relationship with his or her child when required to exercise visitation only in the presence of the other parent or a member of the other
                            parent's family who may share such hostilities. There are, of course, circumstances warranting such restrictions, but if they are imposed, they must be based on appropriate factual findings. Johnson v. Johnson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 263 S.E.2d 822 (1980).

                            When severe restrictions are placed on the right of visitation, this section requires the trial judge to make findings of fact supported by competent evidence which warrant the restrictions.

                        <p>
                            Because the parameters placed on a mother's visitation with the mother's child were not the severe restrictions that effectively denied the right of reasonable visitation, the trial court did not err by entering the court's visitation order without finding
                            that the mother was an unfit person to have reasonable visitation. Evidence supported the finding that the mother's behavior had caused the child stress and been deleterious to the child's well-being so that it was in the best
                            interest of the child that the mother was supervised for extended visits. Paynich v. Vestal, - N.C. App. - , 837 S.E.2d 433 (2020).

                            When Finding of Unfitness Is Not Necessary. - Trial court may grant full custody to one parent and deny visitation to the other parent, so long as the trial court has entered a written finding of fact that such a custody award is in the best interests
                            of the children, without the need to have determined that the parent who has been denied visitation is a person deemed by the trial court to be unfit to spend time with the children. Routten v. Routten,
                            <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 571</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 154 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court denied visitation by defendant with the children without a determination that she was unfit; as there was no dispute that the trial court found that visitation with defendant would not be in the best interests of the children, this was a proper
                            standard to apply in resolving the custody and visitation matters. Routten v. Routten, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 571</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 154 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Statute identifies two different circumstances in which a parent can be denied visitation, and the disjunctive term "or" in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.5ol1i" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.5(i)</a></cite> establishes
                            that either of the circumstances is sufficient to justify the trial judge's decision to deny visitation; in a dispute between two parents, if the trial court determines that visitation with one parent is not in a child's best
                            interests, then the trial court is authorized to deny visitation without a requirement to find the parent in question is unfit. Routten v. Routten, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 571</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 154 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a dispute between two parents with equal parental rights, the trial court must apply the best interest of the child standard to determine custody and visitation questions, and if the court determines that one parent should not be awarded reasonable
                            visitation, the court shall make a written finding of fact that the parent being denied visitation rights is an unfit person to visit the child or that such visitation rights are not in the best interest of the child. Routten

         Visitation Rights Eliminated.
        </b> - Trial court properly granted sole custody of a child to the mother and eliminated a father's visitation privileges because the findings of fact supported its conclusion that the father could have no direct contact
                            with the child; the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the mother not to inform the father of her and the child's address because the father threatened to kill her, failed to engage in therapy and to benefit
                            from a domestic violence program, and was violent with her. Huml v. Huml, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 532 (2019).

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion by eliminating a father's access to information because the restriction was based on the specific facts of the case, and the trial court described its rationale in detail; the order was exceptionally detailed,
                            well-organized, and thorough because the trial court noted the factual basis for the restrictions even to obtaining information from third parties and made detailed findings regarding the father's failure to follow the requirements
                            of prior orders. Huml v. Huml, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 532 (2019).

                            Trial court properly granted sole custody of a child to the mother and eliminated a father's visitation privileges because the father consistently refused to take advantage of any opportunity to allow him to resume visitation; the father repeatedly failed
                            to participate in counseling as ordered, to take medication as prescribed, to comply with orders regarding public visitation and with the rules governing supervised visitation, and to protect the child from exposure to domestic

         Findings of Fact.

                            sexual contact or behavior actually happened but was concerned about the possibility of inappropriate sexual behavior; however, the evidence was not sufficient for the trial court to make a finding it had occurred or had not

                            Findings Held Sufficient. - Finding of trial court that defendant had previously taken minor child to Texas under a false pretense and had subsequently refused to return him to North Carolina was a sufficient and appropriate factual finding to support
                            the court's limitation as to the location of visitation (in North Carolina at plaintiff 's home.) Brewington v. Serrato, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 726, 336 S.E.2d 444 (1985).

                            Judge did not err by imposing excessive restrictions on mother's visitations with her son; evidence supported the judge's finding that mother's demonstrations of anger and hostility in the presence of the child and her frustration of the relationship
                            between the child and father necessitated, for the child's best interest, the restrictions the judge imposed on the visitation. Correll v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 380

                            Trial court erred in suspending a father's visitation because the trial court failed to make written findings of fact regarding the fitness of the father or the best interests of the children, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.5ol1i" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.5(i)</a></cite>.

                            Trial court found that it would not be in the children's best interests to have any visitation with the father because he confessed that he had engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with one of his minor daughters; he entered pleas of guilty to five
                            counts of indecent liberties with that minor daughter; and he engaged in grooming behaviors with his other two daughters and inappropriately touched them. Respess v.

                            Findings Held Insufficient. - The trial court's findings in a child custody proceeding that respondent mother had abandoned her child and that it would not be in the best interests of the child for him to be carried back and forth between North Carolina,
                            home of the father, and New Jersey, home of the mother, were insufficient to support the trial court's order restricting respondent's visiting privileges, which were limited to one weekend a month, to occasions only when petitioner
                            father or his designated representative was present. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 263 S.E.2d 822 (1980).

                        <p>
                            No competent evidence showed that the father had engaged in any conduct that warranted forfeiture of his visitation rights or that the exercise of his visitation rights would be detrimental to the child's best interest, and the court's factual finding
                            that the motel room where the father lived was an unfit environment for visitation did not support supervised visitation. Hinkle v. Hartsell, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 833, 509 S.E.2d

                            Where the court merely recited the testimony of witnesses and did not make the required findings of fact, further findings of fact and a determination of the father's parental fitness was needed if he was to be denied all contact with his daughter. Moore

                            was in dispute. Alexander v. Alexander, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 16, 2021).

         Visitation Rights Survived Termination of Parental Rights.
        </b> - Trial court erred in concluding a grandmother's visitation rights under a prior custody order did not survive termination of a mother's parental rights because the grandmother not only intervened in the case
                            but also obtained visitation rights via a permanent custody order; thus, the termination of the mother's parental rights did not extinguish the grandmother's court-ordered visitation rights, and the grandmother could seek to
                            enforce the prior custody order through contempt proceedings. Adams v. Langdon, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 236 (2019).

                            The grandmother did not have standing under this section to seek visitation rights with her grandchildren, where the children had been adopted by their biological aunt and her husband, and there was no custody dispute. Hill v. Newman,

                            There are four statutes in North Carolina which permit a grandparent to maintain an action for custody or visitation of a minor child, and although plaintiff, mother of the deceased father of the two minor children, did not specify under which statute

                            Grandparents lacked standing to bring a claim for visitation because there was no ongoing custody proceeding, as the mother had a natural and legal right to custody and control of the child upon the father's death and the child had not been adopted by
                            a stepparent or relative. Graham v. Jones, - N.C. App. - , 842 S.E.2d 153 (2020).

                            a grandparent must prove that the child's family is not intact before the grandparent can intervene to request visitation with his grandchild - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.1(a)</a></cite>,

                    In an action or proceeding for the custody or support, or both, of a minor child, including a motion in the cause for the modification or revocation of an existing order for custody or support, or both, the court may in its discretion order payment of
                    reasonable attorney's fees to an interested party acting in good faith who has insufficient means to defray the expense of the suit. Before ordering payment of a fee in a support action, the court must find as a fact that the party
                    ordered to furnish support has refused to provide support which is adequate under the circumstances existing at the time of the institution of the action or proceeding; provided however, should the court find as a fact that the supporting
                    party has initiated a frivolous action or proceeding the court may order payment of reasonable attorney's fees to an interested party as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.

                            As this section requires that awards of attorneys' fees be reasonable, cases construing the statute have in effect annexed a fifth requirement concerning reasonableness onto the express statutory ones; namely, that the record must contain findings of

                            Because this section allows for an award of reasonable attorneys' fees, cases construing the statute have in effect annexed an additional requirement concerning reasonableness onto the express statutory ones. Thus, the record must contain additional findings
                            of fact upon which a determination of the requisite reasonableness can be based, such as findings regarding the nature and scope of the legal services rendered, the skill and time required, the attorneys' hourly rate, and its

                            Unreasonable Depletion of Separate Estate Not Intended. - It would be contrary to the intent of the legislature to require one seeking an award of attorneys' fees to meet the expenses of litigation through the unreasonable depletion of her separate estate,
                            where her separate estate is smaller than that of the other party. Cobb v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 592, 339 S.E.2d 825 (1986).

                            Findings Held Insufficient. - Factual findings on award of attorneys' fees were deficient as to child support where there was no finding that the supporting spouse refused to provide adequate support under the circumstances existing at the time the action
                            was initiated, and as to both alimony and child support, where there were no factual findings upon which a determination of the reasonableness of the award could be based, other than the trial court's statement that the time

                            In a child support case, a mother was not awarded attorney's fees because she had the means to defray the cost of the litigation; moreover, the father did not refuse to provide support which was adequate under the circumstances. The record indicated that
                            the father complied with the terms of an agreement directing him to make child support payments; in fact, he voluntarily made support payments in excess of what he was required to pay. Hinshaw v. Kuntz,

                            Trial court erred by awarding the wife attorney fees for the modification of child support because the husband was still paying his full obligation at the time of the institution of both motions to modify child support and by awarding fees without specifying

                            Award of Fees Held Error. - The trial court erred in requiring plaintiff father to pay counsel fees of defendant mother for a hearing upon defendant's motion for an increase in the amount of child support payments made by plaintiff, where there was no
                            showing or finding that at the time of the hearing defendant was a dependent spouse. Crouch v. Crouch, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 49, 187 S.E.2d 348, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 314</cite>,

                            Where the trial court failed to make a finding of fact with respect to the wife's ability to defray the expense of the suit, as required by this section, the court abused its discretion in ordering plaintiff husband to pay attorneys' fees. Nolan v. Nolan,

                            The trial court could not order defendant to pay plaintiff's attorney for the time spent in representing her on a contempt citation stemming from her violation of defendant's court-ordered visitation rights. Daniels v. Hatcher,

                            Findings were inadequate to support an award for payment of attorneys' fees where trial court failed to make specific findings of fact required by statute and case law and instead found only that plaintiff did not have the ability to defray the costs
                            and expenses to employ adequate representation, that the attorney had provided valuable services, and that the attorney expended in excess of five hours representing plaintiff. Cameron v. Cameron,

                            Where plaintiff introduced affidavits of her legal expenses but trial court made no findings on all the factors required under this section, award of attorneys' fees was vacated.

                            While attorney fees were proper for a prospective child support claim and for a claim for recovery reasonable and necessary medical expenses, they were erroneously imposed for a retroactive child support claim, which was not warranted by applicable law.

                            Reversal of Fee Award Where Increase in Support Reversed. - Where that part of order increasing child support payments was reversed, the award of attorneys' fees also had to be reversed. Mullen v. Mullen, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite>                            627, 339 S.E.2d 838 (1986).

                            Where both of plaintiff's attorneys, who represented her in the custody and support hearings, submitted detailed affidavits of their experience, time, and preparation of the case, the trial judge properly found that an attorneys' fee of $80.00 per hour
                            for 75 and 10 hours of time respectively was a reasonable amount to award for time spent on the issue of support only. Savani v. Savani, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 496, 403 S.E.2d

                            Trial Court Erred in Considering Relative Estates of Parties. - Where the evidence failed to show that defendant did not have ample income to defry the expenses of the action and would have been required to deplete her estate to pay expenses, the trial
                            court erred in considering the relative estates of the parties in assessing the defendant's ability to employ "adequate" counsel. Van Every v.

                            Award of Fees Appropriate. - The trial court did not err in requiring father to pay reasonable attorneys' fees of mother in a habeas corpus proceeding to determine the custody of their minor children, where custody of the children had been awarded to
                            mother by both North Carolina and South Carolina courts, and father's failure to return the children to mother in South Carolina after a visit in this State forced mother to come to this State to secure their return, and father
                            was not providing support for the children as he had been ordered. In re Hopper, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 611, 182 S.E.2d 228, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 727</cite>,

                            Where district court found that defendant acted in good faith and could not defray the expenses of lawsuit without impoverishing herself, and the plaintiff had not furnished adequate support for several months, the findings were sufficient to support
                            award of attorney's fees. Osborne v. Osborne, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 497 S.E.2d 113 (1998).

                            Attorney fees were properly awarded to the father in a child custody case, where the trial court made factual findings as to the parties' financial resources, that the father was an interested party acting in good faith, and as to father's attorney's
                            skill, rates, and rendition of services. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 515 S.E.2d 61 (1999).

                            Trial court did not err in awarding attorney's fees to plaintiff's counsel where defendant had substantial assets, retirement and investment accounts, a home, an aircraft, a boat and a business, and plaintiff had a $41,000 income plus $2,000 in modest

                            Trial court could order the husband to pay the wife's attorney's fees incurred in seeking to have the husband held in contempt, even though he could not be held in civil contempt due to obeying the trial court's orders prior to the contempt hearing, where
                            the trial court found: (1) the wife was acting in good faith; (2) she had insufficient means to pay her attorney's fees; and (3) the attorney's fees were reasonable.

                            There was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding of the wife's inability to defray the cost of litigation in a divorce proceeding as she had been paying all of the uninsured medical expenses for the past two years and had outstanding

                            Order that the father pay attorneys' fees was proper because the action involved both child custody and child support, and the trial court based its calculation on an extensive discussion with the mother's counsel as well as careful consideration of the
                            attorneys' affidavit stating the number of hours he worked on the custody and support claims. Spicer v. Spicer, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 283, 607 S.E.2d 678 (2005).

                            Attorney's fee award in favor of the mother in a child custody and support action was proper because, inter alia, the affidavit and detailed billing records submitted in support of the request, along with the husband's stipulation as to reasonableness
                            of counsel's hourly rate, supported the award. Attorney fee award was not used as punishment but was based upon mother's insufficient means to defray expense of suit.

                            Trial court properly awarded attorney's fees to a former wife under the statute because its findings that the wife's actions were filed in good faith and that she had insufficient means to defray the costs of her action were supported by the wife's affidavits;
                            the attorney's fees provision in the separation agreement did not apply because there was no determination of a breach of the agreement or order for specific performance. Hennessey v. Duckworth,

                            Wife was properly awarded attorney fees related to her successful child custody claim. Comstock v. Comstock, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 304, 771 S.E.2d 602 (2015).

                        <p>
                            Former wife was entitled to attorney's fees because (1) the former wife filed a custody action in good faith, despite the former wife's parental deficiencies, and (2) the former wife had insufficient means to defray suit costs, given the former wife's
                            income and lack of personal assets. Setzler v. Setzler, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 781 S.E.2d 64 (2015).

                            Father was properly ordered to pay a mother's attorney's fees because the trial court made statutorily required findings as well as findings of the reasonableness of the award. Summerville v. Summerville, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite>                            228, 814 S.E.2d 887 (2018).

                        <p>
                            Order requiring a husband to pay a wife's attorney's fees was not an abuse of discretion because (1) the court properly relied on pleadings and the court record, including uncontested custody and support orders and a motion to continue, (2) disparity
                            of financial resources was not a required consideration, and (3) detailed findings supported the conclusion that the wife was a dependent spouse with insufficient means to defray litigation costs. Beasley v. Beasley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 816 S.E.2d 866 (2018).

                            Award of attorney's fees to a mother was appropriate because, although the parties settled their custody dispute by consent order in a manner more favorable to the father than to what the mother sought, the mother acted in good faith in defending against
                            the father's child custody and child support claims and in pursuing counterclaims. Moreover, because the father's monthly income was several times more than the mother's income, and the mother had recently declared bankruptcy,
                            the mother had insufficient means to defray the expense of the suit. Conklin v. Conklin, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 825 S.E.2d 678 (2019).

                            Award Within Discretion of Trial Court. - Award of appellate attorney's fees in matters of child custody and support, as well as alimony, is within discretion of trial court; this holding applies to any appeal of child custody or support order, whether
                            order is interlocutory or final. McKinney v. McKinney, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 300, 745 S.E.2d 356 (2013), review denied, 753 S.E.2d 678, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 46 (2014), review dismissed,

                            Denial of Fees Upheld. - Respondent in a child custody proceeding was not entitled to an award of counsel fees or to have court costs taxed against petitioner father, where respondent introduced no evidence with respect to her dependent status or inability
                            to defray the expense of the suit, and where she was not the party for whom judgment had been given. In re Cox, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 687, 195 S.E.2d 132, cert. denied,

                        <p>
                            Where defendant complied with all orders that directed him to make child support payments, and when necessary defendant voluntarily made payments for the support of the parties' children, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny plaintiff's
                            motion for an award of attorneys' fees. Prescott v. Prescott, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 350 S.E.2d 116 (1986).

                            Disallowance of Fees As Matter of Law Held Improper. - The trial court, in its discretion, was fully authorized to disallow attorneys' fees for defendant's counsel, but to disallow such fees as a matter of law was error. Brandon v. Brandon,
                            <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 457, 179 S.E.2d 177 (1971).

                            Entitlement to Legal Representation Not Limited to Trial Level. - There is nothing in our statutory or case law to suggest that a dependent spouse in this State is entitled to meet the supporting spouse on equal footing, in terms of adequate and suitable
                            legal representation, at the trial level only. Fungaroli v. Fungaroli, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 270, 280 S.E.2d 787 (1981).

                            Award of attorneys' fees for services performed on appeal should ordinarily be granted, provided the general statutory requirements for such an award are duly met, especially where the appeal is taken by the supporting spouse. Fungaroli v. Fungaroli,

                            Award of Fees by Appellate Court. - Neither this section nor any other statute authorizes an appellate court to make an award of attorneys' fees. Tilley v. Tilley, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 581, 227 S.E.2d 640

                            Distinction Between Taxing Fees as Costs and Ordering Payment. - As to the difference between including attorney fees in the costs taxed against a party to a lawsuit and in ordering the payment of attorneys' fees, see Smith v. Price,
                            <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 523</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 408 (1986).

                            A request for attorneys' fees may be properly raised by a motion in the cause subsequent to the determination of the main custody action. In re Scearce, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 345 S.E.2d 411, cert. denied,

                        <p>
                            Time for Motion. - Where intervenors' motion for attorneys' fees was made approximately four months after the trial court had entered order awarding custody to the intervenors, and approximately four months after county division of social services had
                            filed its notice of appeal to that order, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the intervenors' motion. However, following resolution of the appeal of the custody order, the trial court could consider intervenors'
                            motion for attorneys' fees. In re Scearce, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 345 S.E.2d 411, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 415</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 590 (1986).

                            Reservation of Issue of Fees when Judgment Rendered. - Since the trial court expressly reserved the issue of attorney's fees at the time it rendered judgment as to the custody matters before it, it retained the authority to consider the issue since attorney's
                            fees were within the court's "oral announcements." Surles v. Surles, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 437 S.E.2d 661 (1993).

                            Review of Attorney's Fees on Appeal. - While whether the statutory requirements have been met is a question of law, reviewable on appeal, the amount of attorneys' fees is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and is only reviewable for an abuse
                            of discretion. Atwell v. Atwell, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 328 S.E.2d 47 (1985).

                            The findings required by this section must be supported by competent evidence and are fully reviewable on appeal. Boyd v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 343 S.E.2d 581 (1986).

                        <p>
                            The trial court committed error in failing to make adequate findings of fact to support its denial of attorney's fees. Gowing v. Gowing, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 613, 432 S.E.2d 911 (1993).

                            Judicial Notice of Rates of Local Attorneys. - Denial of a mother's motion for attorney fees was error because, contrary to the trial court's finding, it was not barred from taking judicial notice of customary rates of local attorneys under G.S. 8C-1-201(b);
                            trial court's belief that it lacked authority to apply judicial notice was instrumental in its decision. Simpson v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 320, 703 S.E.2d 890 (2011).

                            Where cause was heard upon plaintiff's motion for an increase in child support payments and upon defendant's motion for a modification of the child custody order, the trial court's award of attorney fees did not have to be supported by a finding that
                            defendant, the party ordered to furnish support, had refused to provide support which was adequate at the time of the institution of the action. Fellows v. Fellows, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite>                            407, 219 S.E.2d 285 (1975).

                            This section requires, in a child support action, a finding that defendant refused to provide support. In an action for custody and support, findings of fact are not required to sustain an award for counsel fees. Walker v. Walker,

                            Findings Required in Action for Support. - A finding of fact supported by competent evidence must be made on the issue of whether the party ordered to furnish support has refused to provide support which is adequate under the circumstances existing at
                            the time of the institution of the action or proceeding, in addition to meeting the requirements of "good faith" and "insufficient means," before attorneys' fees may be awarded in a support suit. This issue is a question of
                            law, reviewable on appeal. Hudson v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 465</cite>, 263 S.E.2d 719 (1980).

                            Before a court can award attorneys' fees to an interested party under this section in a motion in the cause proceeding for a modification of child support, the court must make the following three findings of fact: (1) the party is acting in good faith;
                            (2) the party has insufficient means to defray the expenses of the suit; and (3) the party ordered to pay support has refused to provide support which is adequate under the circumstances existing at the time of the institution
                            of the action or proceeding. Quick v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 528, 313 S.E.2d 233 (1984).

                        <p>
                            The text of this section sets out four requirements to support an award of attorneys' fees, namely: (1) that the party awarded fees be an interested party; (2) that that party be acting in good faith; (3) that that party have insufficient means to defray
                            the expense of the suit; and (4) that the party ordered to furnish support have refused to provide adequate support under the circumstances existing at the time the action was instituted. Warner v. Latimer,
                            <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 314 S.E.2d 789 (1984).

                        <p>
                            Where the action is one for custody or custody and support, the first sentence of this section applies, and the court may award attorneys' fees to an interested party if it finds (1) that the party acted in good faith and (2) that the party lacks the
                            means to defray the expense of the suit. Where the action is solely one for support, attorneys' fees may be awarded provided the court finds, in addition, that the party ordered to furnish support has refused to provide support
                            which is adequate under the circumstances existing at the time of institution of the action or proceeding. Gibson v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 316 S.E.2d 99 (1984).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In actions for support only, the court may award reasonable attorneys' fees to a party if it finds: (1) that the party is acting in good faith; (2) that the party has insufficient means to defray the costs of the action; and (3) that the party ordered
                            to pay support had not provided adequate support under the circumstances existing at the time of the institution of the action or proceeding. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite>                            82, 327 S.E.2d 273 (1985).

                        <p>
                            To award attorneys' fees in a child support action, the trial court must find as fact that: (1) The interested party (a) acted in good faith and (b) has insufficient means to defray the expenses of the action; and (2) the supporting party refused to provide
                            adequate support "under the circumstances existing at the time of the institution of the action or proceeding." Moreover, the required findings of fact must in turn be supported by competent evidence, such as that of the parties'
                            incomes, estates and debts. Brower v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 331 S.E.2d 170 (1985).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where trial court's order was devoid of any statutorily required findings of fact, the award of attorneys' fees could not stand. Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 699, 373 S.E.2d 312 (1988).

                            Case would be remanded where trial court failed to make specific findings that: (1) the mother was acting in good faith; (2) the mother's means were insufficient to defray the expenses of the suit; and (3) the father refused to provide the child support
                            which was adequate under the circumstances existing at the time of the action. Thomas v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 591, 518 S.E.2d 513 (1999).

                            After the father had been found to be in contempt due to his failure to pay child support, the trial court made sufficient findings of fact to support an award of attorney's fees to the mother under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.6" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.6</a></cite>,
                            despite the fact that there was no finding that the mother was an interested party with insufficient means to defray the cost of the litigation; under
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4(c)</a></cite>, the children's ability to pay attorney's fees was at issue, not the mother's, and the mother was an interested party under

                        <p>
                            In a child support and alimony modification case, there was no dispute that the husband had stayed current with his child support payments, and had in fact overpaid; therefore, although the amount of child support was modified, the wife was not entitled
                            to attorney's fees under this section. Parsons v. Parsons, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 752 S.E.2d 530 (2013).

                        <p>
                            Mother appeared to have met the statutory requirements but the trial court made no findings on the factors, and thus, the court of appeals could not review the denial of attorney fees; the father refused to provide support adequate under the circumstances
                            existing at the time of institution of the action, and the trial court's findings had address each of the four statutory factors on remand. Crews v. Paysour, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite>                            557, 821 S.E.2d 469 (2018).

                            estates of the parties. Sarno v. Sarno, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 804 S.E.2d 819 (2017).

         Insufficient Means to Defray Expense of Suit.
        </b> - Trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to a mother following a child custody dispute because, although she testified she would soon be leaving her university position in the following months, the trial court
                            was required to calculate her earnings as they existed at the time of the hearing, not as they would allegedly stand in the future, and, had the trial court correctly calculated the mother's monthly earnings from employment,
                            the amount would have exceeded her monthly expenses, and the court could not have properly determined whether the mother had "insufficient means" to defray the costs of the suit. Sherrill v. Sherrill, - N.C. App. - , 846 S.E.2d

                            Plaintiff's contention that proceeding was solely one for support was without merit, where plaintiff's modification motion initially put the issue of custody before the court, even though the issue of custody was quickly settled by agreement. Theokas

                            Award Upheld. - Trial court order requiring mother to pay $2,500 to the father of the parties' three minor children was proper because the three children resided with the father, along with his new wife and three other children, the father had inadequate
                            monthly income, and the attorneys' fees were reasonable. The fees were found to have been increased as a result of the mother's failure to contribute a reasonable sum to the support of the children after being asked to do so.

                            Trial court's order for fees met the statutory requirements, as it found that defendant was an interested party acting in good faith and had insufficient means to defray the expense of the suit; in the findings, the trial court noted defendant's gross
                            income, how he had borne all of the expenses associated with the child while in his primary care, and his attorney filed an affidavit, outlining costs and fees incurred by defendant in the action. Sarno v. Sarno,

                            Trial court's decision to award attorney's fees for defendant's response to the petition for writ of mandamus was not manifestly unsupported by reason; although the petition might have been moot, it could not be said that defendant's filing was wholly
                            unnecessary, and it was in the discretion of the trial court to award fees for this filing. Sarno v. Sarno, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 804 S.E.2d 819 (2017).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering attorneys' fees because there was evidence to support its determination as to the reasonableness and amount of attorneys' fees; the mother's counsel presented evidence of supplemental attorney's fees
                            and expenses in connection with the matter, and the trial court found the amount reasonable. Simms v. Bolger, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 522 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Original award of attorneys' fees was not unreasonable and did not otherwise constitute an abuse of discretion because the trial court noted that the mother had the means and ability to defray a large portion of the expenses of the suit, and the award
                            would be both just and within the father's ability to pay. Simms v. Bolger, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 522 (2019).

                            Use of Word "May". - Where defendant contended that the use of the word "may" in this statute authorizes the trial court in the exercise of its discretion to refuse to exercise its jurisdiction, he misconstrued the statute. The word "may" authorizes the
                            trial judge to enter an order of modification upon a showing of changed circumstances. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 371 S.E.2d 756 (1988).

                            There is no requirement that each successive custody hearing start with a "clean slate" and that the court not rely on the record previously generated. To the contrary, custody proceedings generally are continuing in nature. Best v. Best,

                            Noncustodial parent is not entitled as a matter of law to a credit against accrued arrearage in child support for expenses incurred while the child was with the noncustodial parent. Each case must be decided upon it own facts, and the guiding principle
                            is whether an injustice would exist if a credit is not given. Simmons v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 725, 329 S.E.2d 723 (1985). And see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.10" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.10</a></cite>

                            Jurisdiction To Modify Custody Order. - Trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html#t50Aa02s50A-203" target="_blank">G.S. 50A-203(2)</a></cite> to modify a Michigan

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in granting a mother legal and primary physical custody because the court was permitted to make an initial child custody determination since the juvenile court in the neglect proceeding returned custody to the parties; in the absence
                            of an existing permanent child custody order, the trial court was not required to find or conclude that there existed a substantial change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the child for purposes of modifying an existing
                            custody order. McMillan v. McMillan, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 692 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Statutory Compliance Required. - Since there is a statutory procedure for modifying a custody determination, a party seeking modification of a custody decree must comply with its provisions. Bivens v. Cottle (Westlake),
                            <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 462 S.E.2d 829 (1995), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 270</cite>, 485 S.E.2d 296 (1997).

                            Trial Court May Not Sua Sponte Modify Child Support. - It was error to order a father to pay all children's uninsured medical expenses because neither party asked the court to reevaluate a prior apportionment of such expenses, nor were the expenses subsumed
                            in a prior child support order before the court, since the expenses were separately dealt with, so the trial court had no authority to modify previously agreed support on the court's own motion. Moore v. Moore,
                            <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 768 S.E.2d 4 (2014).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's sua sponte child support modification was vacated because (1) such modifications were generally prohibited, and (2) there was no showing of acts sufficient to satisfy the statutory purpose. Summerville v. Summerville,
                            <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 814 S.E.2d 887 (2018).

                        <p>
                            A court is without authority to sua sponte modify an existing support order. Royall v. Sawyer, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 880, 463 S.E.2d 578 (1995).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court's order allowing partial payment of support obligation at contempt proceeding did not constitute a modification, such modification of child support being only allowed "upon motion in the cause and a showing of changed circumstances by either
                            party." Bogan v. Bogan, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 176, 516 S.E.2d 641 (1999).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Court does not have the authority to sua sponte modify an existing support order, and modification of a support order cannot occur until the threshold issue of substantial change in circumstances has been shown. Miller v. Miller,
                            <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 40, 568 S.E.2d 914 (2002).

                            The welfare of the children in controversies involving custody is the polar star by which the courts must be guided in awarding custody. Pruneau v. Sanders, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 214 S.E.2d 288, cert.
                            denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 664</cite>, 216 S.E.2d 911 (1975); Dean v. Dean, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 232 S.E.2d 470 (1977).

                        <p>
                            And the Determinative Factor. - The welfare of the child, not the frustration of the court order, is the determinative factor. Gordon v. Gordon, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 265 S.E.2d 425 (1980).

                        <p>
                            And Is the Ultimate Object in Securing Child Support. - The welfare of the child is the "polar star" in the matters of custody and maintenance, yet common sense and common justice dictate that the ultimate object in such matters is to secure support commensurate
                            with the needs of the child and the ability of the father to meet the needs. Crosby v. Crosby, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 235</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 77 (1967).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ultimate object in setting awards of child support is to secure support commensurate with the needs of the children and the ability of the father to meet the needs. Gibson v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite>                            520, 211 S.E.2d 522 (1975).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The welfare of the child is always open to inquiry by the court, and upon the showing of a change of circumstances the order of custody may be modified. In re Mason, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 185 S.E.2d
                            433 (1971), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 495</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 513 (1972).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Best Interests of the Child. - When a father filed a motion for modification of custody, a trial court did not abuse its discretion in looking back to the facts surrounding the best interests of the child, pursuant to
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.2ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.2(a)</a></cite>, at the time the memorandum of judgment was entered to make appropriate findings to provide a base line before it could determine if
                            there had been a material change in circumstances, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7</a></cite>, because the mother and father had waived findings of fact and conclusions of
                            law at the time the memorandum of judgment by consent was entered. Balawejder v. Balawejder, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 721 S.E.2d 679 (2011).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Father's appeal was timely because, while the trial court orally rendered an order modifying child custody at the conclusion of the hearing and entered the order, the record did not contain a certificate to evidence when the father was served with the
                            order or anything indicating when he received actual notice that it had been entered, and the order, although denominated a "temporary order," was in fact a permanent order that was immediately appealable, and a "best interests
                            of the child" standard was properly applied in modifying a prior temporary custody order since it left certain issues to be determined at a later date. Brown v. Swarn, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite>                            418, 810 S.E.2d 237 (2018).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Best Interests of Child" Standard Applied to Temporary Order. - Trial court properly applied the "best interests of the child" standard in declining to modify a child custody award because the initial custody order was not final where it left open a
                            parent's visitation periods and was subject to regular review to ensure the parent's increased participation pending recovery from a traumatic brain injury. Simmons v. Arriola, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite>                            671, 586 S.E.2d 809 (2003).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court's order which ordered that plaintiff mother retain physical custody of the child during the school year and that defendant father have physical custody during the summer months was affirmed because there was competent evidence to support the
                            trial court's finding that the child custody matter did not lie dormant after the May 26, 2006 consent order was entered and this finding supported the trial court's conclusion that the May 26, 2006 consent order remained a
                            temporary order. Therefore, the trial court did not err in utilizing the best interest of the child standard to establish child custody rather than reviewing the evidence for a substantial change in circumstances. Miller v.
                            Miller, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 577, 686 S.E.2d 909 (2009).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The control and custody of minor children cannot be determined finally. Changed conditions will always justify inquiry by the courts into the interest and welfare of the children, and decrees may be entered as often as the facts justify. In re Herring,
                            <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 434</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 775 (1966); In re Bowen, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 236, 172 S.E.2d 62 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Neither agreements nor adjudications for the custody or support of a minor child are ever final. McLeod v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 144</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 65 (1966).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As children develop, their needs change, and these needs must be supplied by the parent, whose ability to supply them may change. For these reasons orders in custody proceedings are not final. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 72</cite>,
                            145 S.E.2d 332 (1965).

                        <p>
                            A judgment awarding custody is based upon conditions found to exist at the time it is entered. The judgment is subject to such change as is necessary to make it conform to changed conditions when they occur. In re Bowen,
                            <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 236, 172 S.E.2d 62 (1970); Owen v. Owen, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 229 S.E.2d 49 (1976).

                        <p>
                            And Is Temporary in Nature. - All custody orders are from their very nature temporary and founded upon conditions and circumstances existing at the time of the hearing. Brandon v. Brandon, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            457, 179 S.E.2d 177 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although they provide guidance, prior custody orders are not binding in subsequent proceedings. Custody orders are not permanent, but remain freely modifiable upon appropriate evidence of changed circumstances. Williams v. Williams,
                            <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 372 S.E.2d 310 (1988).

                            And May Be Altered upon a Change in Circumstances. - Decrees entered by North Carolina courts in child custody and support matters are impermanent in character and are res judicata of the issue only so long as the facts and circumstances remain the same
                            as when the decree was rendered. The decree is subject to alteration upon a change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the child. Crosby v. Crosby, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 235</cite>,

                        <p>
                            It is elementary that court decrees in child custody and support matters are not permanent in character and may be modified by the court in the future if subsequent events and the welfare of the child require. In re Rose,
                            <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 176 S.E.2d 249 (1970).

                        <p>
                            An order awarding the custody of minor children determines the present rights of the parties, but is not permanent in nature, and is subject to modification for a subsequent change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the children. Thomas v. Thomas,
                            <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 461</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 871 (1963); In re Bowen, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 236, 172 S.E.2d 62 (1970); Owen v. Owen, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 229 S.E.2d 49 (1976).

                            The entry of an order in a custody matter does not finally determine the rights of parties as to the custody, care and control of a child, and thus when a substantial change of condition affecting the child's welfare is properly established, the court
                            may modify a prior custody decree. Blackley v. Blackley, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 358</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 678 (1974); Hassell v. Means, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 257 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            On a hearing in a custody suit, the judgment is not intended to be a final determination of the rights of the parties touching the care and control of the child; thus, on a change of conditions, properly established, the question may be further heard
                            and determined. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 72</cite>, 145 S.E.2d 332 (1965).

                        <p>
                            The purpose of a child support proceeding is to determine the nature and extent of the support required. The initial determination is subject to modification or vacation at any time upon motion and a showing of changed circumstances. The support issue
                            thus may be before the court on numerous occasions during a child's minority. Leach v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 304 S.E.2d 265 (1983).

                            and not to motions for change of custody based on changed circumstances. Speaks v. Fanek, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 470 S.E.2d 82 (1996).

                            affecting the welfare of the child. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 635, 197 S.E.2d 629 (1973).

                            While the provisions of a valid separation agreement relating to marital and property rights of the parties cannot be set aside by the court without the consent of the parties, no agreement between husband and wife can serve to deprive the courts of their
                            inherent authority to protect the interests of and provide for the welfare of minor children. Hershey v. Hershey, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 692, 292 S.E.2d 141 (1982).

                            Change in Circumstances Is Threshold Issue. - Modification of a support order cannot occur until the threshold issue of substantial change in circumstances has been shown.

                        <p>
                            Trial court applied an incorrect standard in granting a father's motion to modify a child custody order since the order from another state was a permanent custody order, and rather than first determining whether a substantial change in circumstances had
                            occurred as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7(b)</a></cite>, the trial court proceeded straight into a best interests analysis. Hatcher v. Matthews,

                            Party Required to Demonstrate Substantially Changed Circumstances. - Under this section, a party is required to demonstrate substantially changed circumstances affecting the welfare of the child in order to be granted a modification of an existing custody
                            order. The word custody under the statute also includes visitation. Savani v. Savani, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 496, 403 S.E.2d 900 (1991).

                        <p>
                            No agreement or contract between husband and wife will serve to deprive the courts of their inherent as well as their statutory authority to protect the interests and provide for the welfare of infants. The parties may bind themselves by a separation
                            agreement or by a consent judgment, but they cannot thus withdraw the children of the marriage from the protective custody of the court. Voss v. Summerfield, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                            839, 336 S.E.2d 144 (1985).

                            Retroactive Increase Requires "Emergency Situation". - Child support reimbursement or child support governing a period prior to a motion to increase an existing child support order would constitute retroactive child support and would not be based on the
                            presumptive guidelines. Therefore, a child support payment order may not be retroactively increased without evidence of some emergency situation that required the expenditure of sums in excess of the amount of child support
                            paid. Biggs v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 524 S.E.2d 577 (2000).

                            due the agreement gives rise to the presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the amount agreed upon is just and reasonable. Voss v. Summerfield, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                            839, 336 S.E.2d 144 (1985).

                            Burden in Seeking Modification of Separation Agreement Not Incorporated in Order. - When a motion is made to modify the child support provisions of a separation agreement which has not previously been incorporated into an order or judgment of the court,
                            the moving party's only burden is to show the amount of support necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the child at the time of the hearing, and he is not required to show a change in circumstances. Should the evidence establish,
                            giving due regard to the factors contained in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4(b)</a></cite> and (c), that such amount substantially exceeds the amount
                            agreed upon in the separation agreement, such evidence would necessarily rebut the presumption of reasonableness of the amount of child support established in the agreement and establish the need for an increase. However, absent
                            such a showing, the agreement of the parties will be deemed to be reasonable. Boyd v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 343 S.E.2d 581 (1986).

                            Mother did not establish that she relied to her detriment on the parties' agreement to reduce child support; since the support order was not judicially modified, the separation agreement remained in full force and effect. Baker v. Showalter,

                            Effect of Reconciliation on Support Provisions of Separation Agreement. - A separation agreement is terminated for every purpose, insofar as it remains executory, when the parties resume the marital relationship. Among the executory purposes for which
                            a separation agreement is terminated is the payment of child support. But while the courts have held that reconciliation voids alimony provisions, whether in a separation agreement or a court order, this principle has not been
                            applied to void, as a matter of law, a judgment ordering payment of child support. Walker v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 297 S.E.2d 125 (1982).

                            Relitigation of Paternity Not Basis for Modifying Support Agreement. - While a voluntary support agreement may, upon motion and a showing of changed circumstances, be modified or vacated at any time, it cannot be modified or vacated on the basis of relitigation,
                            in a proceeding related solely to the order for support, of the paternity issue. That issue is res judicata and shall not be reconsidered by the court in such a proceeding. Beaufort County v. Hopkins,

                            Arbitration Award Remains Reviewable and Modifiable. - While there exists no prohibition to the parties settling the issues of custody and child support by arbitration, the provisions of an award for custody or child support will always be reviewable
                            and modifiable by the courts, as parents cannot by agreement deprive the court of its inherent and statutory authority to protect the interests of their children, and further, a court order pertaining to custody or support
                            of a minor child does not finally determine the rights of the parties as to these matters. Crutchley v. Crutchley, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 518</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 793 (1982).

                            Custody Provisions in a Divorce Decree Are Subject to Modification. - The provision of a final decree of divorce awarding the custody of the minor children of the marriage is subject to modification for subsequent change of condition as often as the facts
                            justify. In re Marlowe, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 197</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 204 (1966).

                            A decree awarding custody of the child of the marriage as between its divorced parents is determinative of the present rights of the parties, but is not permanent, and may be later modified by the court upon a change of conditions. Hardee v. Mitchell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 40</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 884 (1949); Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 404</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 133 (1953).

                            As Are Support Provisions Therein. - The court has jurisdiction to modify an order for the support of a child of the marriage entered in the husband's action for absolute divorce and may do so upon the wife's motion in the cause made subsequent to the
                            rendition of the decree of absolute divorce. Story v. Story, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 114</cite>, 19 S.E.2d 136 (1942).

                        <p>
                            While the rule in Walters v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 381</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 338 (1983) did not apply to a divorce judgment entered prior thereto, the language used by the court in absolute divorce judgment,
                            incorporating separation agreement into the judgment, was sufficient under the law as it existed prior to Walters to evidence the court's intent to make the parties' separation agreement its own determination of their respective
                            rights and obligations. Thus, when the court adopted the parties' agreement as to child support as its own determination of the amount of child support to be paid by defendant, this order of support became modifiable in the
                            same manner as any other child support order. Holthusen v. Holthusen, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 618, 339 S.E.2d 823 (1986).

                            awarded to defendant as part of the divorce judgment, not merely by agreement of the parties, any subsequent modification must be made in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. Barnes v. Barnes,

                            In wife's action for alimony without divorce and for child support, the Court of Appeals would not disturb an order of the trial court requiring husband to make substantial payments to wife for alimony and for support of the minor children, notwithstanding
                            husband's contention that he anticipates a substantial decrease in earning, since the order was temporary in nature and is subject to modification upon change of circumstances. Fonvielle v. Fonvielle,

                            To properly determine child's present reasonable needs, trial court must hear evidence and make findings of specific fact on the actual past expenditures for the minor child, the present reasonable expenses of the minor child, and the parties' relative
                            abilities to pay. Mullen v. Mullen, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 339 S.E.2d 838 (1986); Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 232, 365 S.E.2d 688 (1988).

                            Inclusion of Estimated Expenses for Items That Custodial Parent Cannot Currently Afford Not Improper. - In support modification proceedings it was not improper for the court to include in its findings estimated expenses for certain items that plaintiff
                            could not currently afford; simply because a custodial parent is unable to afford a certain item or expense is no reason to disqualify that item as a reasonable need of the child. Findings of fact as to actual past expenditures
                            are meant to aid the trial court in determining the reasonable needs of the children, not to hamper the court's ability to assess the children's reasonable needs. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                            232, 365 S.E.2d 688 (1988).

                            An order providing for temporary child support is not an appealable final order, whereas an order providing for permanent child support until emancipation is an appealable final order even though permanent child support orders may be modified upon a showing
                            of change of circumstances. Banner v. Hatcher, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 439, 477 S.E.2d 249 (1996).

                            Modification of Support Provisions Upheld. - Where, in a decree of divorce, father was ordered to pay a certain sum monthly for the support of his infant daughter, and by its first order the court retained the cause subject to the right of either party
                            at any time to apply for a modification of the order, and pursuant to this provision the court later, upon father's insolvency, made the sums assessed a charge on plaintiff's homestead and personal property exemptions when
                            allotted, the modification was authorized by statute as well as by the order of the courts. Walker v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 210</cite>, 167 S.E. 818 (1933).

                            In the modification of an order for child support, there was no error where the trial court found sufficient facts to justify an increase in the child support payments, and these findings were supported by competent evidence in the record. Gibson v. Gibson,

                            Modification of Custody and Support Provisions Upheld - Trial court's judgment transferring custody of a child from his mother to his father and ordering the mother to pay child support was supported by evidence which showed that the mother moved frequently,
                            had no home of her own, moved in with her boyfriend, and actively attempted to prevent the father from visiting his child, and that the father was about to remarry and could provide a stable home for the child. Shipman v. Shipman,

                            Modification of Custody and Support Provisions Erroneous. - The trial court errs in modifying a previous order as to custody of and support of children in the absence of a motion for modification and absent any showing of changed circumstances. Smith
                            v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 180, 189 S.E.2d 525 (1972).

                            In the absence of any evidence and finding of any change in circumstances, it was error for the trial court to order an increase in the amount of child support.

                            Trial court's findings held insufficient to justify an increase in support payment of $500.00 for two children, as specified in separation agreement, to payment of $800.00 for one child following older child's attaining of her majority. Rice v. Rice,

                            Where there was no evidence that defendant, who worked for a school system as a psychologist, intentionally depressed his income or otherwise engaged in bad faith, the trial court erred by imputing income to defendant for four weeks during the school

                            Father did not show sufficient changed circumstances to warrant modification of either the support or custody order of his three children, even though mother no longer retained custody of the oldest daughter, as the welfare of the children at the time
                            the contest came on for hearing was the controlling consideration and, based on their welfare, modification in his favor was not warranted. Davis v. Davis, (N.C. App. Aug. 7, 2001).

                            Modification of Custody Order Erroneous. - Where the trial court correctly found that no change in circumstances affecting minor's welfare had been shown, its order requiring plaintiff/mother to give defendant/father final decision-making authority as
                            to child's schooling, extracurricular activities, and travel constituted a wrongful modification of prior custody order. Sain v. Sain, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 517 S.E.2d 921

                            Where there was no written order signed before the wife filed her motion to modify custody, and the written order granting joint custody was eventually entered on the same day that the trial court heard the motion to modify, an appellate court reversed
                            the order modifying custody because there was nothing to modify since there was no order when the mother filed her motion to modify; even if it were proper for the trial court to hear the motion, it was impossible for there
                            to have been a change in circumstances between the time the order was entered and the time it was modified on the same day, and in deciding whether a change of circumstances had occurred, the trial court should not have considered
                            the events that transpired between the time it announced its joint custody decision and the date of the entry of the order. Carland v. Branch, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 595

                            Where although father, the custodial parent, presented some evidence of present and future expenses, he presented no evidence of child-oriented expenses at the time of the prior hearing, the trial court did not have all of the evidence necessary to establish
                            a change of circumstances and did not err in refusing to modify plaintiff 's child support. Fischell v. Rosenberg, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 368 S.E.2d 11 (1988).

                            Trial court erred by purporting to modify a June 2010 custody order because the June order was a temporary order and the trial court did not consider the July 2011 permanent order when considering the modification. Woodring v. Woodring, - N.C. App. -

                            permanent order was entered in July 2011, and the only facts that were not res judicata for a determination of a substantial change in circumstances were facts that occurred after the July 2011 hearing or prior facts that were

                            Modification When One of Several Children Reaches Age 18. - While child support obligations ordered by a court terminate upon the child reaching age 18, unless the child is otherwise emancipated prior to reaching age 18 or the trial court in its discretion
                            continues to enforce the payment obligation after the child reaches age 18 and while the child is in primary or secondary school, when one of two or more minor children for whom support is ordered reaches age 18, and when the
                            support ordered to be paid is not allocated as to each individual child, the supporting parent has no authority to unilaterally modify the amount of the child support payment. The supporting parent must apply to the trial court

                            Trial court erred in modifying an existing support decree from the State of Georgia when there were no findings of fact or conclusions of law showing a change of circumstances to support such a conclusion. Shores v. Shores,

                            Without evidence of any change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the child or an increase in need, an increase for support based solely on the ground that the support payor's income has increased is improper. Greer v. Greer,

                            There are no exceptions in North Carolina law to the requirement that a change in circumstances be shown before a custody decree may be modified. Bivens v. Cottle (Westlake), <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 467,

                            Because a trial court could not, on the one hand, conclude there was not a substantial change of circumstances, and at the same time change the existing consent order, and the parties' incomes had to be considered to properly evaluate the mother's motion

                            In a custody case, trial court erred in granting intervener caretaker's motion to intervene and motion for custody because it did not contain any grounds for modification of the prior custody order and did not allege a substantial change in circumstances

                            A party seeking modification of child custody has the burden of showing changed circumstances only where an order for permanent custody already exists. Regan v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 851, 509 S.E.2d

                            A change in circumstances may be shown in any of several ways: an increase or decrease in the child's needs; a substantial and involuntary decrease in the income of the non-custodial parent; a voluntary decrease in income of either supporting parent;
                            and, if the support order is at least three years old, proof of a disparity of fifteen percent or more between the original order and the amount under the Child Support Guidelines. Wiggs v. Wiggs,

                            Or a Separation Agreement. - Where parties to a separation agreement agree upon the amount of the support and maintenance of their minor children, there is a presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the amount mutually agreed upon
                            is just and reasonable, and that upon motion for an increase in such allowance, a court is not warranted in ordering an increase in the absence of any evidence of a change of conditions. Soper v. Soper,

                            Modification of a child support order involves a two-step process: 1) the court must first determine a substantial change of circumstances has taken place; and 2) only then does it proceed to apply the guidelines to calculate the applicable amount of
                            support. McGee v. McGee, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 453 S.E.2d 531 (1995).

                            Although a court must make findings concerning the party's ability to pay, the changed circumstances with which the courts are concerned are those relating to child-oriented expenses. Greer v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite>                            351, 399 S.E.2d 399 (1991).

                        <p>
                            The court erred in concluding that a finding of change in child-oriented expenses is a threshold requirement that must be satisfied before a court can modify a support order because of a change in the supporting party's circumstances, where the defendant
                            presented evidence of a decreased income that could support a modification based on changed circumstances. Padilla v. Lusth, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 709, 457 S.E.2d 319 (1995).

                            The trial court was not required to find adverse changes in circumstances, but properly modified custody based on special needs child's best interests, where (1) reformed father's lifestyle would be better suited to providing the boy with the proper structure
                            and educational opportunities he needed; (2) defendant/mother's job would require her to be away from the child in the evenings, leaving him in the care of others; (3) mother's home schooling of him would not meet his social
                            and educational needs; (4) since father enrolled the child in the local public schools during the trial custody period, the boy had exhibited "phenomenal" improvement with respect to his stuttering and motor tics due to the
                            specialized speech therapy he received; (5) father lived in a spacious new home where the boy had his own bedroom and bathroom; and (6) mother lived in an overcrowded rental home in which the boy shared a bathroom with four

                            Reduction of the monthly child support award was error because the trial court did not make a finding pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7(a)</a></cite> that there had been
                            a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the husband and wife's three minor children. A reduction could not be based on the fact that the husband remarried and had a child born to the new marriage, as
                            the remarriage and obligation of also supporting a new child was a voluntary undertaking on the husband's part. Frey v. Best, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 659 S.E.2d 60 (2008).

                            The original decree ordering the payment of money is an adjudication of the court as to what was reasonable and proper at the time it was made. The burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a material change in the circumstances has

                            A finding of change in child-oriented expenses is not a threshold requirement that must be satisfied before a court can modify a support order because of a change in the supporting party's circumstances. Padilla v. Lusth,

                            Interference with Visitation. - Because the welfare of the child is the paramount concern in custody cases, interference with visitation of the noncustodial parent which has a negative impact on the welfare of the child can constitute a substantial change
                            of circumstances sufficient to warrant a change of custody. Woncik v. Woncik, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 244, 346 S.E.2d 277 (1986).

                            Communication Between Parents. - There was insufficient evidence to support trial court's findings of a substantial change in circumstances justifying a modification of a child custody order based on findings that subsequent to the parents' failed efforts
                            to reunite, communication between them had been unsuccessful, issues relating to domestic violence had not been effectively resolved and had resulted in emotional trauma to the child, and that the parents' failure to communicate
                            regarding issues with the minor child had jeopardized the success of the joint custodial arrangement of the previous order; instead, a review of the record showed ample evidence that although the parents had disagreements and
                            verbal disputes, they had developed ways to communicate regarding the welfare of their son, communicated about the child's health, and that upon request by the mother, the father had delivered medicine to the child's pre-school
                            and had cared for the child at unscheduled times. Ford v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 611 S.E.2d 456 (2005).

                            Removal of Parent to Another Residence. - A finding that mother "is now residing in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina" is not a finding of a substantial change of circumstances that will support the modification of a child custody order. Harrington v.
                            Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 628, 192 S.E.2d 638 (1972).

                            Where a parent changes his residence, the effect on the welfare of the child must be shown in order for the court to modify a custody decree based on change of circumstances. Gordon v. Gordon, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite>                            495, 265 S.E.2d 425 (1980); Ramirez-Barker v. Barker, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C.

                            While it is true that a parent's change of residence does not of itself amount to a substantial change of circumstances, the effects of such a move on the welfare of the child may well amount to a change of circumstances requiring modification of the
                            original custody order. O'Briant v. O'Briant, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 360, 320 S.E.2d 277 (1984), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 432</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 370

                            Relocation After Remarriage. - The trial court erred in amending the custody decree based on a finding of substantial change in circumstances where it found only that the proposed relocation of mother after her remarriage would adversely affect the relationship
                            between father and his child, but made no other findings about the effect of the proposed relocation on the child and on the child's best interests. Evans v. Evans, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite>                            135, 530 S.E.2d 576 (2000).

                            Removal of Child to Another Jurisdiction. - Before an order of custody is changed, more must be shown than mere removal of child from a jurisdiction which may enter an adverse decision to the removing parent. Rothman v. Rothman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 401, 170 S.E.2d 140 (1969).

                            Although it is not so as a matter of law, it will be a rare case where the child will not be adversely affected when a relocation of the custodial parent and child requires substantial alteration of a successful custody-visitation arrangement in which
                            both parents have substantial contact with the child. Ramirez-Barker v. Barker, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 418 S.E.2d 675 (1992).

                            Trial court considered the impact of a father's relocation on the children's welfare because it found that the father took a job in another state after he lost his job in North Carolina and that the father planned to relocate his family to the other state
                            since his prospects for future employment in his position were good, and his monthly salary allowed the father to support the children financially. Crenshaw v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite>                            136, 710 S.E.2d 227 (2011).

                            Change in Custody Between Parents. - A change in custody from the father to the mother was a changed circumstance supporting modification of the mother's child support obligation.

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in modifying a father's support obligation because the significant change in the parties' custodial arrangement alone was sufficient to warrant modification of the existing support order; there was a significant difference in the
                            amount of time that the children were able to spend with the father once the children had all moved to North Carolina. Hart v. Hart, - N.C. App. - , 836 S.E.2d 244 (2019).

                            Adverse Effect on Child as Factor to Support Modification. - An adverse effect on a child as the result of a change in circumstances is an acceptable factor for the courts to consider and will support a modification of a prior custody order, but showing
                            an adverse effect is not necessary for modification. Pulliam v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 616</cite>, 501 S.E.2d 898 (1998).

                            Where parties crossed out a cohabitation provision on the face of their separation memorandum, the trial court only partially discharged its duty in finding that a change of circumstances occurred when husband began cohabiting with his girlfriend because
                            it failed to determine whether plaintiff's wife had met her burden of showing the effect, if any, such change had upon the welfare of the children. Browning v. Helff, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite>                            420, 524 S.E.2d 95 (2000).

                        <p>
                            Because the trial court carefully laid out in sequential order the facts regarding the father's relationship with a married woman, resulting in him resigning from his job, and culminating in his separation from his wife who provided at least 50 percent
                            of the minor child's care, including helping the child with his homework, and then found that the child's grades had suffered as a result, it provided a nexus between the substantial change in circumstances and the affect on
                            the child's welfare to overrule the father's motion to dismiss the mother's custody modification action; moreover, when balanced against the mother's attainment of both a stable living environment and a vast improvement in
                            health after suffering from a brain tumor, the trial court's custody modification order in favor of the mother was upheld. Karger v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 703, 622 S.E.2d

                            Parties' allegations would be sufficient to allege a substantial change in circumstances to permit the trial court to consider a modification of child custody because a father's motion in the cause alleged that the mother had relapsed and had allegedly
                            been observed to be highly intoxicated around the child during custody exchanges; the mother filed a response to the motion containing her own rebuttal and allegations. McMillan v. McMillan, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 692 (2019).

                            Father Met Burden of Showing Adverse Effect of Relocation. - Father met his burden of showing that the proposed relocation of mother and child to California likely would adversely affect the welfare of the child, and thus the "best interest" question
                            was properly before the trial court. Ramirez-Barker v. Barker, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 418 S.E.2d 675 (1992).

                            Decree Is Res Judicata Only as to Facts Then Existing and Before Court. - To modify a custody order, a court must find a change in circumstances. However, when facts pertinent to the custody issue existed at the time of the custody decree but were not
                            disclosed to the court, the prior decree is res judicata only to the facts that were before the court, and other pertinent facts may be considered in subsequent custody determinations. Wehlau v. Witek,

                            In a custody matter, it was error to order that a father's therapist's lack of concerns about the father's mental health or ability to care for the children would constitute a change in circumstances, for modification purposes, because this predetermined

                            Proof Required Absent Evidence of Change in Either Party's Fitness. - Where there is no evidence that the fitness or unfitness of either party has changed, the trial court may not modify a prior order unless sufficient change of circumstances adversely
                            affecting the welfare of the child is shown. Wehlau v. Witek, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 596, 331 S.E.2d 223 (1985).

                            Increase in Father's Income. - The court is not warranted in ordering an increase of child support in the absence of any evidence of a change in conditions or of the need for such increase, particularly when the increase is awarded solely on the ground
                            that the father's income has increased so that he is able to pay a larger amount. Fuchs v. Fuchs, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 635</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 487 (1963); Dishmon v. Dishmon, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite>                            657, 292 S.E.2d 293 (1982).

                            Trial court erred in finding that a mother could not seek an increase in child support from a father; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7(a)</a></cite> provided that child support orders
                            were modifiable at any time, so a provision of the divorce order which stated that the father's support obligation was not modifiable was void. Young v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 31, 609 S.E.2d 795 (2005).

                            Decrease in Father's Income. - Where father's income had decreased from $24,000.00 per month to $2083.33 per month, he had been voluntarily terminated, he had continuously sought employment since being terminated, but those efforts had been impaired due
                            to criminal non-support actions instituted both in Florida and in North Carolina, and his estate had been "substantially depleted,"; although the court failed to use sequentially the words "substantial involuntary reduction"
                            in income, its findings indisputably reflected precisely that. McGee v. McGee, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 453 S.E.2d 531 (1995).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in modifying original child-support order, where most of its findings of fact were insufficient to support the modification, and the sole valid finding was an increase in father's annual income. Thomas v. Thomas,
                            <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 591, 518 S.E.2d 513 (1999).

                        <p>
                            Because the changes in circumstances necessary to support a modification should be determined from the date of the most recent child support order which addressed the obligation in question, and an allegation of a change to the parties' income, without
                            more, was not sufficient to support a motion to modify child support; thus, the ex-husband's motion to modify child support was properly dismissed. Devaney v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite>                            208, 662 S.E.2d 672 (2008).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in denying a father's motion for a downward modification of child support under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7(a)</a></cite> because the trial court found
                            that the father had incurred no additional cost in covering the child on his wife's health insurance policy, and no documentation about the insurance was included in the record on appeal; the trial court found that the father's
                            insurance coverage of the child was unnecessary because the mother had been providing coverage for the child on her policy. Orange County ex rel. Pattison v. Hamilton, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 205, 714 S.E.2d

                            Although a father was entitled to the presumption of a substantial change in circumstances, in accordance with Child Support Guidelines, N.C. Ann. R. 41 and 46, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not modifying the amount of child support,
                            pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7(a)</a></cite>, because the presumption was rebutted by evidence the father intentionally left his job, thereby
                            voluntarily depressing his income. Johnston County v. Bugge, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 722 S.E.2d 512 (2012).

                            Ability to Pay. - Where there was no evidence that the needs of defendant's minor children had changed; however, there was evidence that defendant's ability to pay his support payments had decreased, the decision of the trial court denying motion for
                            reduction of support was remanded to the district court. Pittman v. Pittman, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 808, 443 S.E.2d 96 (1994).

                            Involuntary Decrease in Income. - A significant involuntary decrease in a child support obligor's income satisfies the necessary showing even in the absence of any change affecting the child's needs. Hammill v. Cusack,
                            <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 453 S.E.2d 539 (1995).

                            Voluntary Decrease in Income. - Father was not entitled to reduction in child and post-separation support payments under

                            the father's unemployment was voluntary and that the father disregarded marital and parental obligations, as the father was fired for engaging in several incidents of intentional misconduct. Wolf v. Wolf, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite>                            523, 566 S.E.2d 516 (2002).

                            Earning Capacity. - The father's earning capacity could not be used in determining his child support obligation, where the father was involuntarily terminated from his former job, and no evidence was presented that he acted in bad faith by deliberately
                            depressing his income. Chused v. Chused, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 508 S.E.2d 559 (1998).

                            Imposition of Earnings Capacity Rule. - Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4</a></cite> and this section, a husband's ability to pay child support is normally determined by his actual
                            income at the time the award is made or modified. If, however, there is a finding that the husband is deliberately depressing his income or otherwise acting in deliberate disregard of his obligation to provide reasonable support
                            for his child, his capacity to earn may be made the basis of the award. Under these circumstances, his motion to reduce the amount of child support will be denied. Goodhouse v. DeFravio, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite>                            124, 290 S.E.2d 751 (1982); Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C.

                            A court may refuse to modify a support and/or alimony award on the grounds that husband has failed to exercise his reasonable capacity to earn because of a disregard of his marital and parental obligations to provide reasonable support for his wife and
                            minor child. Wachacha v. Wachacha, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 248 S.E.2d 375 (1978).

                        <p>
                            The determination that a husband's change in circumstances has been voluntarily effected by him in disregard of his marital and parental obligations justifying imposition of the earnings capacity rule is a conclusion of law based on the factual findings
                            in the particular case. Wachacha v. Wachacha, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 248 S.E.2d 375 (1978).

                            A party's capacity to earn income may become the basis of an award if it is found that the party deliberately depressed its income or otherwise acted in deliberate disregard of the obligation to provide reasonable support for the child. Askew v. Askew,

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly increased a father's child support obligation pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7(a)</a></cite>, as the trial court made sufficient findings of fact
                            to support its conclusion that the father retired and voluntarily reduced his income in deliberate disregard of his obligations, based on the fact that the father retired shortly after his wife won a large lottery award, and
                            the trial court therefore properly imputed income to the father pursuant to Child Support Guidelines, N.C. Ann. R. (2003) 33, 35, at the level of the father's earnings prior to his retirement. Mason v. Erwin, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite>                            284, 579 S.E.2d 120 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Where trial court made no findings as to self-employed father's present earnings, nor as to his reduction of income in bad faith that would support application of the earnings capacity rule, and made no findings as to a substantial change in his income
                            compared to the findings in the previous order, the trial court's conclusion and order increasing his child support under the guidelines for self-employed individuals was not supported by the findings. Ford v. Wright,
                            <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 611 S.E.2d 456 (2005).

                            A person's capacity to earn income may be made the basis of an award if there is a finding that the party deliberately depressed his or her income or otherwise acted in deliberate disregard of the obligation to provide reasonable support for the child.

                            Consideration of Spouse's Capacity to Earn Held Error. - Trial court could not consider father's capacity to earn in computing his income where the evidence indicated that he lost his job due to no fault of his own, and the court's order contained no
                            findings that he had deliberately stopped working to avoid his support obligations. Greer v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 399 S.E.2d 399 (1991).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The court's conclusion underlying imposition of the earnings capacity rule must be based on evidence that tends to show that husband's actions resulting in the reduction of his income were not taken in good faith. Wachacha v. Wachacha,
                            <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 248 S.E.2d 375 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Voluntary Expenses. - Fact that defendant had voluntarily assumed the responsibility of supporting his emancipated son was not a factor to be considered in determining a change of circumstances sufficient to support a reduction in support of his minor
                            children. Dishmon v. Dishmon, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 292 S.E.2d 293 (1982).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was error for the trial court to reduce the amount of child support payments required of defendant by one-third where defendant's showing of changed circumstances related almost exclusively to additional expenses to which defendant had obligated himself,
                            including sending a child who had reached the age of majority to college, the expenses of a new home and family, and additional travel and telephone expenses incident to visiting his children from out-of-state, and where defendant
                            made no showing with respect to changed circumstances affecting the remaining minor children and made no showing that the expenses relating to the children's maintenance and support decreased by one-third when one of the children
                            reached majority. Gilmore v. Gilmore, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 560, 257 S.E.2d 116 (1979).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fact that defendant voluntarily assumed the financial burden to send his eldest child to a high-tuition, out-of-state university did not justify consideration of this factor in lowering child support payments. Gilmore v. Gilmore,
                            <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 560, 257 S.E.2d 116 (1979).

                        <p>
                            The trial court did not err in denying the husband credit for the purchase of two automobiles for his children, considering his history of delinquent payments and the lack of the wife's consent to these voluntary expenditures. Brower v. Brower,
                            <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 331 S.E.2d 170 (1985).

                            Waiver of Credit for Child's Receipt of Earnings. - There was no evidence that the husband ever objected to his unemancipated child's receipt of earnings. His right to credit for those earnings was therefore waived. Brower v. Brower,
                            <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 331 S.E.2d 170 (1985).

                            Consideration of Needs of Father's Second Family. - In determining a father's ability to meet the required payments for the support of his children, some reasonable allowance must be made for his living expenses and for the fact that he has a second family.
                            However, the needs of children of his first marriage cannot be made subservient to the needs of his second family. Beasley v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 245 S.E.2d 820

                            and the court erred in ordering a reduction of payment by reason of the fact that the oldest child had reached 18. Hershey v. Hershey, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 692, 292 S.E.2d 141

                            Where a person having custody under a prior order has become unfit or is no longer able or suited to retain custody, such a consideration is of utmost importance in inquiring into the matter of custody, but it is not alone determinative. In re Bowen,
                            <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 236, 172 S.E.2d 62 (1970).

                            If the parent who was awarded custody of children were subsequently to become unfit, it would be possible for the trial court, upon proper findings, to grant custody to a fit person. Where there is no evidence that the fitness or unfitness of either party
                            has changed, the trial court may not modify a prior order awarding custody unless some other sufficient change of condition is shown. In re Poole, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 173

                            but subsequently this changed, the court was entitled, in view of these changed circumstances, to inquire again into the matter of custody and to determine whether the welfare of the children would be better served by placing
                            them in the custody of their mother. Kenney v. Kenney, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 665, 190 S.E.2d 650 (1972).

                            order and granted primary custody of the parties' two children to the mother; the trial court properly found a substantial change in circumstances based on the father's interference with the mother's relationship with the children,
                            the trial court had jurisdiction pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html#t50Aa02s50A-202ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 50A-202(a)</a></cite>, and the trial court properly denied the father's motions

                            Arbitrary termination of visitation rights of grandparents by mother constituted a substantial change of circumstances where the grandparents had established a continuing substantial relationship with their grandchildren since the entry of earlier custody
                            order, and the court found sufficient facts to justify its conclusion that it was in the best interest of the grandchildren to maintain a continuing relationship with the grandparents through the granting of visitation privileges.

                            that the child had severe emotional problems requiring "substantial immediate change", that the visitation schedule be limited, and that one parent (mother) exercise more control; the judge agreed with doctor that the child's
                            problems needed immediate remedy; however, he believed that father was the parent to exercise more control. Correll v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 380 S.E.2d 580 (1989).

                            that she allowed boyfriend to live in her home for several weeks and continued to see him, along with psychologist's testimony as to a deterioration in the children's behavior corresponding with boyfriend's involvement with

                            The court's finding that father had improved, after finding him totally uninvolved at the time of the prior order, represented a changed circumstance justifying some modification at least with respect to the father. Best v. Best,

                            The court's findings as to child's poor health and conduct when with defendant mother, and as to her improved state when with plaintiff father, supported by competent evidence as to the child's conduct, habits, health, schedule, treatment, and response
                            at different times, justified changing the joint custody arrangement that was in force, for these findings indicated changed circumstances that were affecting the welfare of the child. Teague v. Teague,

                        <p>
                            The trial court did not err in transferring custody of the minor child to defendant where the financial strain caused by plaintiff 's loss of her job and the birth of two additional children within two years out of wedlock clearly constitutes a substantial
                            change of circumstances. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 369 S.E.2d 92 (1988).

                            The court's effective determination of a "substantial involuntary reduction" in father's income was adequate to support its conclusion that there had been a change of circumstances sufficient to warrant modification of previous child support order; thus
                            the court did not err in failing to make findings concerning the actual past expenditures of the minor children prior to reaching its change of circumstances decision. McGee v. McGee, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite>                            19, 453 S.E.2d 531 (1995).

                            In child custody action, findings supported trial court's conclusion that there had been a substantial change of circumstances since the order where father had consistently attempted to thwart efforts by the defendant to maintain and develop a mother-child
                            relationship with child, where father threatened to stop or disallow visitation by the mother with the child, and where mother's home life and family situation changed and improved since the order. Hamilton v. Hamilton,

                            Evidence about child's psychological state supported judge's finding of a substantial change of circumstances and the change of custody of the child from the mother to the father where doctor testified that the disappearance of child's emotional equilibrium
                            occurred during a period when the predominate parental influence upon him was mother and that a possible cause of the child's problems was his mother's hostility which centered around the child's visitations with father, visitations
                            which were often interfered with by mother. Correll v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 380 S.E.2d 580 (1989).

                            Modification of a child custody order was in the child's best interest where the mother, although able to provide for the child, exposed the child to emotional harm and caused the deterioration of the child's relationship with his father. Jordan v. Jordan,

                            Modification of a child custody order was in the child's best interest where the trial court's findings were adequately supported by the evidence. Both parties testified that the mother allowed the child to view electronic mail messages that were sent
                            by the father to the mother and the father also presented evidence that he had not been able to place telephone calls to the child as part of his visitation schedule.

                            Modification of prior custody order was upheld where the mother's remarriage exposed the children to alcohol abuse, violent behavior, illegal drugs, and risk of physical harm, thus supporting the trial court's decision that there was a material and substantial
                            change in circumstances and that modification would be of material benefit and in the children's best interest. Dreyer v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 155, 592 S.E.2d 594 (2004).

                            Trial court's order increasing the husband's child support obligation was based on a material and substantial increase in both parties' incomes, living costs, and an increase in the costs of the needs and extra-curricular activities of the children. Meehan

                            Prior custody order was properly modified for a substantial change in circumstances under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7(a)</a></cite> as the trial court properly considered events
                            after the prior custody order in finding that: (1) a mother had given birth to the child's sibling; (2) the mother had separated from her husband; (3) the child was in first grade; (4) the child had been diagnosed with and
                            had treatment recommended for ADHD; and (5) the child needed ADHD medication and a father was willing to provide it. Lang v. Lang, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 746, 678 S.E.2d 395 (2009).

                            Trial court did not err in modifying a custody order because its unchallenged findings supported the conclusion that a father met his burden of showing that a change in circumstances actually had occurred and that the changes had affected the welfare
                            of the children; the evidence revealed material changes in the circumstances, with respect to the parties' comparative stability as well as other considerations, between the time of the hearing resulting in the custody order
                            and the modification proceedings. Crenshaw v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 710 S.E.2d 227 (2011).

                            Father was entitled to modification of a child custody order vesting primary custody of the children with the mother based on a substantial change of circumstances, where the mother had engaged in a course of conduct demonstrating hostility toward the
                            father in front of the children, the mother lived over an hour from the children's school and often failed to get the children to school on time or at all, and the mother was emotionally unstable and volatile. Stephens v. Stephens,

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in modifying a father's monthly child support obligation because there had been a substantial change in circumstances since the initial child support order; the father had settled his workers' compensation and
                            third-party claim, resulting in two large distributions and cessation of his monthly workers' compensation benefits, the child's expenses for day care and health insurance, and the child's expenses for day care and health insurance
                            had increased. Simms v. Bolger, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 522 (2019).

                        <p>
                            In a case in which the father had been traveling out of town frequently for his work, his travel schedule was irregular, and he and the mother had serious difficulties in communicating and making arrangements for changes in the child's schedule, to the
                            child's detriment, the father's motion to modify custody was improperly dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because the father's motion to modify alleged at least one substantial change
                            of circumstances as the father was no longer required to travel and was available and able to care for the minor child on an equal basis with the mother. Stern v. Stern, - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 490 (2019).

                            Trial court did not err by modifying the custody order because its conclusion of law that there had been a substantial change in circumstances was supported by findings of fact, which were in turn based on competent evidence. The substantial change in
                            circumstances presented by the father justified the trial court's decision to enter the modification order, including his new job, his new home, the child beginning first grade, the father marrying his girlfriend, and the child's
                            close relationships with the girlfriend and her stepbrother. Fecteau v. Spierer, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 20, 2021).

                            Showing of Changed Circumstances Held Insufficient. - Where there was no finding of the plaintiff's original child-oriented expenses and no finding that the needs of the children had increased other than the unsupported finding that the children were
                            older and thus their needs had substantially increased, there was not a sufficient showing of a "change in circumstances" within the meaning of this section. Waller v. Waller, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite>                            710, 202 S.E.2d 791 (1974).

                            In a case where the sole finding of fact regarding a change of circumstances was a general finding that the child was older and that inflation had occurred, this, standing alone, was inadequate to support an order of increased support payments. Holder

                            In a child custody order modifying the rights of defendant, the evidence was insufficient to show a substantial change in circumstances since the only change was defendant's new job enabling him to keep child with him at work and plaintiff's plans to
                            marry, her increased income and that she no longer lived with her mother. Hinton v. Hinton, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 676, 362 S.E.2d 287 (1987).

                            Findings of fact found by the trial court held supported by the evidence and clearly and more than amply supported the court's conclusion that defendant had failed to show a substantial change of circumstances that would warrant a modification of consent

                            In an action to modify child support provisions of a separation agreement which has not previously been incorporated into an order or judgment of the court, the court is called upon, for the first time, to make a determination that the reasonable needs
                            of the children are provided for in accordance with the abilities of those responsible for the children's support. Holderness v. Holderness, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 370 S.E.2d

                            Where the trial court found that defendant voluntarily quit his job, willfully and intentionally depressed his income, and failed to meet his burden of proof in showing a substantial change of circumstances, the court entered a judgment against defendant
                            denying his motion to reduce child support by reason of substantial change of circumstances. Askew v. Askew, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 458 S.E.2d 217 (1995).

                            As a substantial change in child's circumstances that was not present before the entry of the original child custody order was not shown, and the father's relocation to Hawaii was not a substantial change in circumstances affecting the child's welfare
                            requiring that the joint custody order be amended allowing the father to move the child to Hawaii, trial court improperly modified the custody order, and the appellate court would vacate and remand the case to the trial court.

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that there had not been a change in circumstances affecting the welfare of a husband and wife's child because the mother spanked the child, the child expressed a desire to live with the husband, and
                            the child had lived with the husband for four months, and the court's judgment denying the husband's motion for a change of custody was affirmed. Scott v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite>                            382, 579 S.E.2d 431 (2003).

                            There was insufficient evidence to support trial court's findings of a substantial change in circumstances justifying a modification of a child custody order based on findings that the parents' failure to communicate regarding issues with the minor child
                            had resulted in trauma to the child and jeopardized the success of the joint custodial arrangement of the previous order; other than the mother's testimony regarding the child's normal reaction to a parental disagreement, no
                            testimony was offered which supported a finding of emotional harm; indeed, the trial court made a specific finding of fact as to the current condition of the minor child, stating that he was very smart, very inquisitive and
                            very happy, and daycare workers, grandparents, individuals who knew the parties, and both parents supported the trial court's finding as to the child's condition. Ford v.

                            There was insufficient evidence to support trial court's findings of a substantial change in circumstances justifying a modification of a child custody order based on findings that issues relating to domestic violence had not been effectively resolved;
                            the trial court's findings reflected no substantial changes in the parties' communication difficulties from the prior order, the trial court had already considered the parties' past domestic troubles and communication difficulties
                            in the prior custody order, and without findings of additional changes in circumstances or conditions, modification of the prior custody order was in error. Ford v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite>                            89, 611 S.E.2d 456 (2005).

                            Trial court properly granted a directed verdict pursuant to N.C. R. Civ.

                            as the evidence supported the finding that the husband did not show a substantial material change in circumstances; the evidence supported the determination that the husband's motivation in not looking for employment in good

         IV. VISITATION RIGHTS.

                            Custody Encompasses Visitation Rights. - Visitation privileges are but a lesser degree of custody. Thus, the word "custody," as used in this section, was intended to encompass visitation rights as well as general custody. Clark v. Clark,
                            <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 554</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 129 (1978).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jurisdiction of courts in custody and thus, visitation, cases is continuous. A decree determines only the present rights with respect to such custody and is subject to judicial alteration or modification upon a change of circumstances affecting the welfare
                            of the child. In re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 302 S.E.2d 259 (1983).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Visitation and child support rights are independent rights accruing primarily to the benefit of the minor child and one is not, and may not be made, contingent upon the other. Appert v. Appert, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                            27, 341 S.E.2d 342 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Receipt of Support May Not Be Conditioned on Visitation. - A trial judge does not have authority to condition a minor child's receipt of support paid by the noncustodial parent on compliance with court-ordered visitation allowed the noncustodial parent
                            by ordering that child support paid by defendant be placed in escrow if minor child fails or refuses to abide by the visitation privileges allowed defendant. Appert v. Appert, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                            27, 341 S.E.2d 342 (1986).

                        <p>
                            An agreement by the parties that the court may change visitation privileges in a custody order without any showing of changed conditions does not relieve the court of its duty to determine whether changed circumstances affecting the welfare of the child
                            justify a modification. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 554</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 129 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly refused to consider issue of visitation rights on plaintiff's motion to set aside a child custody order, where such consideration would be a modification of the prior order's grant of exclusive custody to defendant, since the court
                            may modify custody or visitation only upon a showing of changed circumstances and on adequate motion in the cause, and plaintiff's motion was inadequate for this purpose. Dishman v. Dishman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 246 S.E.2d 819 (1978).

                            Pervasive Interference with Visitation Rights Warranted Change in Custody. - Where the trial court made findings detailing a mother's pervasive interference with the father's visitation rights, as well as violent actions by the mother and her family at
                            the father in the presence of the child, and these actions prevented the father from developing a relationship with his daughter resulting in an adverse effect on the welfare of the minor child, a change of custody was warranted.
                            Hicks v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 384, 576 S.E.2d 410 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Modification of Visitation Order. - Because the trial court's visitation order was a permanent order, the trial court erred by failing to mention its latest permanent order and purporting to modify that older order. Woodring v. Woodring,
                            <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 638, 745 S.E.2d 13 (2013).

                            Contempt Order Did Not Improperly Modify Custody. - Trial court did not improperly modify custody or impose improper purge conditions because its contempt order identified what a father could and could not do regarding visitation times in order to purge
                            himself of the civil contempt and insure his compliance with the previous court orders regarding the exchange time for weekend visitations; permanent joint legal custody and secondary physical custody remained with the father
                            both before and after the contempt order. Wilson v. Guinyard, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 229, 801 S.E.2d 700 (2017).

                            Modification of Grandparents' Visitation Rights. - Before an order providing visitation for grandparents of a minor child may be modified, the party seeking modification must show changed circumstances and an abuse of discretion by the trial judge. In
                            re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 302 S.E.2d 259 (1983).

                            Failure to State Findings on Issue of Visitation. - Where there is no finding by the trial court that ordered visitations are in the children's best interest, the case must be remanded for proper findings and conclusions on the issue. Clark v. Clark,
                            <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 554</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 129 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Best Interest of the Child Standard Proper as Visitation Order was Temporary. - Because of the outstanding issues and the order's specification that a further review hearing would be held in a period of time reasonably brief under the circumstances, the
                            order was not a permanent order with respect to visitation; further, because the trial court correctly determined that the order was a temporary order with respect to visitation, it also properly applied a "best interests of
                            the child" standard rather than requiring that the father demonstrate a change of circumstances. Lamond v. Mahoney, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 583 S.E.2d 656 (2003).

                            When Capacity to Pay May Be Basis for Award. - Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4</a></cite> and this section, a party's ability to pay child support is ordinarily determined by the
                            party's actual income at time support award is made or modified. However, if there is a finding by the trial court that the party was acting in bad faith by deliberately depressing his or her income or otherwise disregarding
                            the obligation to pay child support, then the party's capacity to earn may be the basis for the award. Fischell v. Rosenberg, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 368 S.E.2d 11 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Trial Court Required to Make Specific Findings. - It is not sufficient that there may be evidence in the record sufficient to support findings that could have been made; the trial court is required to make specific findings of fact with respect to factors
                            listed in the statute. Such findings are required in order for the appellate court to determine whether the trial court gave "due regard" to the factors listed. Greer v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite>                            351, 399 S.E.2d 399 (1991).

                        <p>
                            Because the juvenile was already the subject of a custody order, the trial court was required to enter an order with findings and conclusions that supported modification of that order, yet no findings or conclusions were made, plus the trial court failed
                            to find that there was not a need for continued State intervention, and remand was required. In re S.M.L., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 21, 2020).

                            As Must an Increase in Child Support. - The court is not warranted in ordering an increase of child support in the absence of findings of fact supported by competent evidence to show a substantial change of condition affecting the welfare of the children.
                            Ebron v. Ebron, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 270, 252 S.E.2d 235 (1979).

                            Findings Held Unsupported. - It was error to order continued counseling on reunifying a child with the child's mother because the trial court's findings of fact did not support the order, as (1) the court found prior reunification efforts caused the child
                            intense psychological stress and that more reunification counseling would re-traumatize the child, and (2) uncontested findings uniformly showed the mother made no improvements in years of prior counseling attempts and that
                            the mother-son relationship had deteriorated further due to the mother's attitude, behavior, and general unwillingness to accept responsibility for the state of the mother's relationship with the child. Williams v. Chaney,
                            <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 593, 802 S.E.2d 756 (2017).

                            To properly determine a child's present reasonable needs, the trial court must hear evidence and make findings of specific fact on the actual past expenditures for the minor child, the present reasonable expenses of the minor child, and the parties' relative
                            abilities to pay. Norton v. Norton, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 213, 332 S.E.2d 724 (1985).

                            In exercising its discretion in determining the best interest of the child in a relocation case, factors appropriately considered by the trial court include but are not limited to: the advantages of the relocation in terms of its capacity to improve the
                            life of the child; the motives of the custodial parent in seeking the move; the likelihood that the custodial parent will comply with visitation orders when he or she is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of
                            North Carolina; the integrity of the noncustodial parent in resisting the relocation; and the likelihood that a realistic visitation schedule can be arranged which will preserve and foster the parental relationship with the
                            noncustodial parent. Ramirez-Barker v. Barker, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 418 S.E.2d 675 (1992).

                            Although a mother voluntarily dismissed her domestic violence complaint at the time a memorandum of judgment was entered regarding custody, a trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the claim when the father filed a motion for modification
                            of custody, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7</a></cite>, because "acts of domestic violence between the parties" was one of the factors the trial

         Insufficient Findings as to Child's Best Interests.
        </b> - Trial court's conclusion for a father to be granted primary physical custody and the mother to be granted secondary physical custody was remanded because the findings of fact did not explain why it was in the
                            best interests of the children for the father to be granted primary physical custody; the custody order merely recognized the existence of disputes and identified evidence from both parties that could bear upon those disputes
                            without resolving the disputes. Hinson v. Hinson, - N.C. App. - , 836 S.E.2d 309 (2019).

                            Evaluation of Parties' Fitness. - The trial court, in deciding cases involving the custody of children, may be called upon to evaluate the emotional stability and fitness of the parties. In making such an evaluation, the court, sitting as the trier of
                            fact, may exercise its own reason and common sense, and use the knowledge acquired by its observation and experience in everyday life. O'Briant v.

                            modification of the custody order. Daniels v. Hatcher, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 481, 265 S.E.2d 429 (1980).

                            Wide Discretion Is Vested in the Trial Judge. - Custody cases often involve difficult decisions; however, it is necessary that the trial judge be given wide discretion in making his determination, for the trial judge has the opportunity to see the parties
                            in person and to hear the witnesses. Pruneau v. Sanders, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 214 S.E.2d 288, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 664</cite>, 216 S.E.2d 911 (1975).

                            The trial judge, having the opportunity to see and hear the parties and the witnesses, is vested with broad discretion in cases involving the custody of children.

                            Judge's Decision Will Not Be Upset Absent Abuse. - In determining child custody wide discretion is necessarily vested in the trial judge who has the opportunity to see the parties and hear the witnesses, and his decision ought not to be upset on appeal
                            absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. In re Mason, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 185 S.E.2d 433 (1971), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 495</cite>, 186 S.E.2d

                            In determining matters of child custody, the trial court is vested with wide discretion, and his decision should not be upset absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion. Hensley v. Hensley, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite>                            306, 204 S.E.2d 228 (1974).

                            What represents the welfare of the child is frequently a difficult determination and the trial court is in the best position to observe the parties and evaluate the evidence. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal if
                            the evidence supports the findings of fact and those findings form a valid basis for the conclusions of law and order. Wehlau v. Witek, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 596, 331 S.E.2d 223

                            If Evidence Supports Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. - Because the trial court has the opportunity to observe all the parties and evaluate evidence which sometimes appears differently in cold print, if the evidence supports the findings of fact
                            by the trial court and those findings of fact form a valid basis for the conclusions of law, the judgment entered will not be disturbed on appeal. Paschall v. Paschall, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite>                            120, 203 S.E.2d 337 (1974).

                            Even If There Is Evidence to the Contrary. - The scope of appellate review of a trial court's judgment awarding custody of children is well settled: The court's findings of fact are conclusive if supported by any competent evidence, and judgment supported
                            by such findings will be affirmed, even though there is evidence to the contrary, or even though some incompetent evidence may have been admitted. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite>                            616, 233 S.E.2d 677 (1977); O'Briant v. O'Briant, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C.

                            The court's findings in modifying a custody decree are conclusive if supported by competent evidence, even if there is evidence contra or incompetent evidence in the record. Best v. Best, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                            337, 344 S.E.2d 363 (1986), overruled on other grounds, Petersen v.

                            Good Faith Finding Required. - Determination of the trial court that it was not necessary to make a finding of bad faith in reduction of income where the party seeking support modification was the custodial parent was not supported by current case law,
                            nor was the trial court correct in concluding that when a custodial parent sought a change of child support based upon a reduction in income, that custodial parent had to request the court to make a finding of fact as to his
                            or her good faith. Fischell v. Rosenberg, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 368 S.E.2d 11 (1988).

                            Must Be Sufficient Evidence of Proscribed Intent. - A trial court's conclusion underlying imposition of the earnings capacity rule must be based upon evidence that the actions which reduced the party's income were not taken in good faith. There must be
                            sufficient evidence of the proscribed intent. Fischell v. Rosenberg, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 368 S.E.2d 11 (1988).

                            Error to Reduce Arrearage Absent Findings or Evidence. - Without the requisite, specific findings or evidence in the record on the child's needs and expenses, or on the relative abilities of the parties to provide support, the trial court erred in reducing
                            the child support arrearage. Brower v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 331 S.E.2d 170 (1985).

                            Modification Improper Without Sufficient Findings of Fact. - Without a finding of a substantial change of circumstances, a modification based solely on the ground that the defendant mother was over-protective was improper. Benedict v. Coe,

                            Court's Discretion To Permit Relocation. - Although most relocations will present both advantages and disadvantages for the child, when the disadvantages are outweighed by the advantages, as determined and weighed by the trial court, the trial court is
                            well within its discretion to permit the relocation. Ramirez-Barker v. Barker, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 418 S.E.2d 675 (1992).

                            Findings Held Sufficient. - Trial court did not err in modifying a Michigan custody order because the trial court's findings demonstrated that it considered factors beyond the parties' relative incomes and standards of living in determining whether there
                            had been a substantial change in circumstances affecting the children's welfare; the trial court addressed the level of involvement of the mother and father in the children's education and extra-curricular activities, the mother's
                            lack of full participation in the children's activities, the mother's missing four or five visits per year with her children, the father's disciplining the children by taking away their privileges, and the mother's not disciplining
                            them. Crenshaw v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 710 S.E.2d 227 (2011).

                            Findings Held Insufficient. - In an action seeking an increase in child support over the amount set forth in separation agreement, the order which contained no specific findings with respect to the actual past or present expenses incurred for the support
                            of the children was insufficient to support the court's conclusion that the reasonable needs of the children amounted to $2,800.00 per month. Holderness v. Holderness, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite>                            118, 370 S.E.2d 602 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Where the factors listed by the trial court as dispositive on the substantial change of circumstance requirement were oriented toward parental fitness, not adverse alterations of the children's welfare, and were bare observations of plaintiff's or defendant's
                            actions, not examples of how those actions adversely impacted the children, the findings, without more, did not meet the standard required to show circumstances must be so changed that the welfare of the child would be adversely
                            affected unless the custody provision was modified. Garrett v. Garrett, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 192, 464 S.E.2d 716 (1995).

                            Award of additional retroactive child support for private schooling was denied where the trial court's limited findings failed to set forth the existence of a "sudden emergency" so unusual or extraordinary as to require plaintiff to expend sums in excess
                            of defendant's existing support obligation, and the court's order contained no findings reflective of defendant's ability to pay during the period the emergency expenses were allegedly incurred. Biggs v. Greer,

                            While the record indicated that there may have been evidence to support the visitation decree, the trial court's sparse findings of fact did not support it; the findings, standing alone, were not sufficient to support the extension of physical, telephonic,

                            from the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines, the trial court did not make sufficient findings of fact regarding the reasonable needs of the children; the order only made findings regarding health insurance and the fact
                            that the children did not need private schooling. Beamer v. Beamer, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 610 S.E.2d 220 (2005).

                            When a father sought a modification of child support, remand was required because without a specific finding as to the father's income at the time of the hearing, the issue of whether his income had been involuntarily decreased could not be resolved.

                            Trial court impermissibly modified child custody without finding a substantial change in circumstances; despite re-captioning the contempt order as one modifying custody, the trial court denied both parties an opportunity to submit evidence or present
                            arguments regarding custody modification. In addition, the trial court made no findings of fact or conclusion of law regarding a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child, only a best interest

                            First Court to Acquire Jurisdiction Retains Jurisdiction. - Except as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.5ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.5(f)</a></cite>, the ordinary rule of civil procedure applies to this
                            section, namely, that the first court to acquire jurisdiction of a cause retains jurisdiction, to the exclusion of other courts. Thus, if a judgment involving the custody and the support of a minor child has been entered in
                            this State, the judge trying a subsequent action for absolute divorce may not interfere with the earlier judgment. Only the court of this State which entered the earlier judgment for custody and support of the minor child may
                            modify or vacate it, upon a motion in the cause and a showing of a change of circumstances. Tate v. Tate, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 681, 177 S.E.2d 455 (1970).

                            already been determined and one of the parties seeks a modification of the order establishing custody and support. In such a case, the court first obtaining jurisdiction retains jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts
                            and is the only proper court to bring an action for the modification of an order establishing custody and support. Tate v. Tate, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 681, 177 S.E.2d 455 (1970).

                            Failure to File Motion Did Not Divest Court of Jurisdiction. - Mother's failure to file a motion to modify the father's child support obligation did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to modify the Voluntary Support Agreement and Order under this
                            section, as the trial court was not divested of its continuing jurisdiction and the provision requiring such a motion was directory, not mandatory. Catawba Cty. v. Loggins, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 83</cite>,

                            of another state, a plaintiff must show (1) jurisdiction and (2) changed circumstances. Hopkins v. Hopkins, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 162, 174 S.E.2d 103 (1970).

                            North Carolina Court Had Authority to Modify Florida Order. - While a Florida order granted custody to the grandmother pursuant to a procedure not found in North Carolina, once the trial court in North Carolina obtained jurisdiction, it had authority
                            to modify the Florida order pursuant to the statute, based upon findings of substantial change in circumstances and that modification would be in the child's best interest; the terms of the Florida order had to be considered,

                            Reduction of Support Without Notice and Hearing Unconstitutional. - In an action seeking enforcement of the provisions of a separation agreement relating to child support, reduction of the child support payments without a proper proceeding and notice
                            and opportunity to be heard deprived plaintiff of her constitutional rights under the due process provisions of the State and federal constitutions. Mann v. Mann, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite>                            587, 291 S.E.2d 794 (1982).

                            Reliance on Previous Adjudication Order Sufficient. - Trial court's finding of fact and conclusions of law that, based on a previous adjudication order, the order granting the father exclusive custody of the children was in the best interests of the children
                            was sufficient to support the modification pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7</a></cite>. In re A.S., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                            139, 641 S.E.2d 400 (2007).

                            Valid Custody Order May Not Be Collaterally Modified. - A valid order awarding custody of the child of the marriage is conclusive upon the parties and may not be modified collaterally by a petition praying that the child's custody be awarded to petitioner
                            during a certain period. Robbins v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 635</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 671 (1966).

                        <p>
                            Modification of child support would be vacated and remanded where it was part of an equitable distribution judgment and thus appeared to have been decided and entered at the same time as the equitable distribution, rather than after the equitable distribution
                            as required by subsection (f) of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20" target="_self">G.S. 50-20</a></cite>. Dorton v. Dorton, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 667, 336 S.E.2d 415 (1985).

                            Proceeding Where Divorce Was Awarded Outside State. - When the parents were divorced outside this State, either parent may have the question of custody as between them determined in a special proceeding. In re Sauls,

                        <p>
                            Standing of County in Modification Action. - Where plaintiff mother, who received public assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program, assigned to county her right to receive any support on behalf of her children, the county, by
                            virtue of the assignment pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.110.html#t110a09s110-137" target="_blank">G.S. 110-137</a></cite>, had an interest in the order for the support
                            of plaintiff's children. Therefore, under subsection (a) of this section, the county had standing to make a motion in an action between plaintiff mother and defendant father to modify a child support order to require that the
                            support be paid to the county. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 260 S.E.2d 812 (1979).

                            Premature Request for Modification. - Plaintiff's request that trial court alter provisions in incorporated separation agreement for modification of child support payments and payments for wife's separate maintenance after July, 1990, was properly denied
                            as premature where the date in question had not yet occurred. Theokas v. Theokas, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 389 S.E.2d 278 (1990).

                            Proper procedure to follow when a supported child reaches majority is to apply to the trial court for relief under this section. Tilley v. Tilley, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 581, 227 S.E.2d 640 (1976).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A husband had no authority to unilaterally attempt his own modification of child support payments upon one of his children reaching the age of 18, and being no longer a "minor" under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048A.html#t48Aa01s48A-2" target="_blank">G.S. 48A-2</a></cite>,
                            even though the support order directed the husband to pay support for "his two minor children. . . ." The proper procedure for the husband to follow would have been to apply to the trial court for relief pursuant to this section.

                            Procedure and Contents of Order for Retrospective Increase. - An order for retrospective increase of an existing child support order must set out a conclusion of law that there was a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare
                            of the child occasioned by a sudden emergency so as to warrant such an increase. The court's conclusion of law must be sustained by specific factual findings based upon competent evidence, reflecting the actual amount disbursed
                            by a party within three years or less of the date of filing of the current motion, towards reasonably necessary expenditures made on behalf of the child. The findings also must reflect the ability to pay of the parent subject
                            to the motion during the period for which increased support is sought. Biggs v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 524 S.E.2d 577 (2000).

                            Court Not Required to Weigh Children's Needs Against Obligor's Ability to Pay Absent Request by Obligor. - Grant of motion to modify obligor's child support was proper, because, inter alia, there had been a substantial change in circumstances in that
                            it had been more than three years since the calculation of the obligor's child support obligation and the current obligations calculation was greater than 15 % of the prior obligation calculation, and trial court made findings
                            concerning the obligor's earning capacity, but was not required to weigh the children's needs against the obligor's ability to pay the amount of support where the obligor did not request a deviation requiring the trial court
                            to make such findings. Head v. Mosier, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 328, 677 S.E.2d 191 (2009).

                        <p>
                            Arbitration. - While, in the absence of court proceedings, parties may settle their disputes by arbitration, once the issues are brought into court, the court may not delegate its duty to resolve those issues to arbitration. Crutchley v. Crutchley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 518</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 793 (1982).

                        <p>
                            Where the only issue before the trial court was the custody of plaintiff's and defendant's son and there was no motion to modify the child support, the trial court was without authority to issue an order modifying an earlier consent order setting child
                            support. Royall v. Sawyer, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 880, 463 S.E.2d 578 (1995).

                            fees to the mother pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.6" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.6</a></cite>, because the trial court specifically found as a fact that the mother was a party acting in good faith to obtain
                            reasonable support for her daughter, that the mother lacked sufficient means to pay her attorney fees, and that the father refused to provide support which was reasonable under the circumstances. Mason v. Erwin, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite>                            284, 579 S.E.2d 120 (2003).

         Waiver of Issue on Appeal.
        </b> - Because a mother asserted inconsistent legal positions on whether a substantial change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the children had occurred before the trial court and the court of appeals, she
                            waived that argument on appeal; the trial court did not err in concluding that a substantial change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the children had occurred. Hinson v. Hinson, - N.C. App. - , 836 S.E.2d 309 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Appeal. - Where an initial custody order awarded custody of a child to the paternal grandmother and the mother's motion to modify custody was denied, the appellate court could not consider the mother's challenge to the initial custody order because the
                            mother's notice of appeal from the denial of the motion to modify made no reference to the initial order and did not properly present the underlying judgment for review. Warner v. Brickhouse,
                            <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 445, 658 S.E.2d 313 (2008).

                        <p>
                            Appellate Jurisdiction. - Appellate court had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a denial of child support modification because: (1) an order continuing an existing order until legally interdependent custody issues could be heard was interlocutory,
                            as, without knowing the custody arrangement, a trial court could not find which child support worksheet to use, or whether to deviate from the guidelines; (2) the order did not resolve the custody issue; and (3) allowing an
                            appeal would lead to an unnecessary appeal. Gray v. Peele, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 761 S.E.2d 739 (2014).

                        Termination of Obligation to Support. - Since the enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48A</a></cite> in 1971, the decisions of the court and the Supreme Court have concluded
                        that the father's legal obligation to support his child ceases when the child reaches the age of 18, provided that it is not shown that the child is insolvent, unmarried, and physically or mentally incapable of earning a livelihood.
                        Nolan v. Nolan, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 202 S.E.2d 344, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 234</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 24 (1974).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the absence of an enforceable contract otherwise obligating a parent, North Carolina courts have no authority to order child support for a child who has attained the age of majority, unless the child has not completed secondary schooling, or, pursuant
                        to this section, the child is mentally or physically incapable of self-support. Bridges v. Bridges, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 355 S.E.2d 230 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Continuance of Obligation. - Ordinarily the law presumes that when a child reaches the age of 21 years (now 18 years) he will be capable of maintaining himself, and in such case the obligation of the father to provide support terminates. But where this
                        presumption is rebutted by the fact of mental or physical incapacity, it no longer obtains, and the obligation of the father continues. Speck v. Speck, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 296, 168 S.E.2d
                        672 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Father Held Not Obligated to Support Mentally Retarded Son Beyond Twentieth Birthday. - Where petitioner mother moved the court to require respondent father to continue to pay child support for their mentally retarded son beyond his twentieth birthday
                        and court ordered respondent to pay $600.00 per month continuing ongoing child support without regard to the child's chronological age in light of the plain and definite meaning of the section, the trial court erred and respondent
                        was not obligated to support his son beyond his twentieth birthday. Yates v. Dowless, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 787, 379 S.E.2d 79, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 703</cite>, 386 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Defendant's Obligation Abrogated by Amendment of Section. - Where defendant's obligation, set out in a consent judgment, to continue supporting his disabled child beyond her minority had been abrogated by the 1979 amendment of this section, which eliminated
                        the requirement compelling parents to continue supporting their disabled children beyond their minority, and he had not contracted to continue the payments apart from that obligation, an order requiring defendant to continue supporting
                        the child had no legal basis. Jackson v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 574, 402 S.E.2d 869 (1991).

                        Failure of Action for Support for College Education to State Claim for Relief. - A daughter, over 18 years of age, who graduated from high school and who brought an action against her father to obtain support for her college education, failed to state
                        a claim for relief, since North Carolina courts do not have authority to order child support for children who have reached their majority. Appelbe v. Appelbe, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 197,

                        District court has concurrent jurisdiction with the clerk of superior court with respect to custody of disabled adult children because the district court obtains jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.8" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.8</a></cite>                        to determine custody only when the disabled adult child at issue has not been declared incompetent and had a guardian appointed; while the superior court clerk retains jurisdiction over all guardianship matters under N.C.

                        Contempt. - Orders finding a father in contempt for a failure to pay child support were vacated because (1) an agency presented no evidence other than the amount of child support arrears or past public assistance owed, while the father presented substantial
                        evidence of an inability to pay, including the father's medical condition and minimal living expenses and lack of income, (2) the orders' findings did not support a conclusion that the father willfully refused to pay or had the
                        ability to pay civil contempt purge payments, (3) nothing showed the father was working at the time of trial, nor was this found, and (4) the trial court did not address how much, if any, regular income the father had or the father's
                        subsistence living expenses. Cty. of Durham ex rel. Wilson v. Burnette, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 17, 821 S.E.2d 840 (2018), aff'd, 824 S.E.2d 397, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 209 (2019).

                        Failure to Notify of Change in Address. - Mailing of a notice of registration to a father's last known address by first-class mail was sufficient to notify the father of a foreign child support order because the notice of filing and the certificate of

                        Modification When One of Several Children Reaches Age 18. - While child support obligations ordered by a court terminate upon the child reaching age 18, unless the child is otherwise emancipated prior to reaching age 18 or the trial court in its discretion
                        continues to enforce the payment obligation after the child reaches age 18 and while the child is in primary or secondary school, when one of two or more minor children for whom support is ordered reaches age 18, and when the support
                        ordered to be paid is not allocated as to each individual child, the supporting parent has no authority to unilaterally modify the amount of the child support payment. The supporting parent must apply to the trial court for modification.

                        Cases holding that where one of two minor children reaches the age of 18, a trial court may retroactively modify child support arrearages when equitable considerations exist which would create an injustice if modification is not allowed, were decided
                        before this section became effective on October 1, 1987. Under this statute, if the supporting party is not disabled or incapacitated as provided by subdivision (a)(2), a past due, vested child support payment is subject to divestment
                        only as provided by law, and if, but only if, a written motion is filed, and due notice is given to all parties before the payment is due. Craig v. Craig, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 615,

                        Oral agreement to modify child support payments would not justify noncompliance with the statute, and an obligor parent would still be required to apply to the court before altering his payments. Van Nynatten v. Van Nynatten,
                        <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 438 S.E.2d 417 (1993).

                        Equitable Estoppel Did Not Bar Claim for Past Support. - Even assuming that on some set of facts equitable estoppel might properly bar a claim for child support arrears, it was inapplicable where husband, seeking to rely on equitable estoppel could not
                        show that, in good faith reliance on the conduct of his ex-wife, he had changed his position for the worse; the only change made in his position was the retention to his benefit of money owed for the support of his children. Griffin

                        Mother did not establish that she relied to her detriment on the parties' agreement to reduce child support; since the support order was not judicially modified, the separation agreement remained in full force and effect. Baker v. Showalter,

                        Full Faith and Credit - Where the only issue was arrearages, a North Carolina trial court erred in failing to give full faith and credit to an Oregon child support order; the trial court's duty was to enforce the Oregon order until a subsequent North
                        Carolina order was entered, and then to enforce a father's child support arrearages under both orders. New Hanover County ex rel. Mannthey v. Kilbourne, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 578

                        Where defendant made no motion for modification of a foreign support order, the North Carolina trial court was without authority to modify, in any way for any reason, past due child support payments; and defendant was not entitled to credit for any sums
                        given directly to the child outside of the foreign support order. Pieper v. Pieper, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 722, 425 S.E.2d 435 (1993).

                    <p>
                        Modification Not Retroactive. - Where plaintiff filed her motion to modify the child support payments on March 27, 1991 and the trial court entered an order on February 18, 1993 increasing defendant's child support obligation from $800 per month to $1,230
                        per month effective April 1, 1991, the trial court noted that on the date this order was entered, the effective date of the time the payments were to begin had passed and ordered defendant to pay $9,890 to the Clerk of Superior
                        Court representing the increase in child support payments for the months of April, 1991 through February, 1993; because April, 1991 was subsequent to the March 27, 1991 filing of the plaintiff's motion, the trial court's order
                        was not a retroactive modification. Mackins v. Mackins, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 442 S.E.2d 352, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 694</cite>, 448 S.E.2d 527 (1994).

                    <p>
                        Evidence of Emergency Situation. - A child support payment may not be retroactively increased without evidence of some emergency situation that required the expenditure of sums in excess of the amount of child support paid. Mackins v. Mackins,

        Arrearage Payment Improper.
       </b> - Trial court abused its discretion by ordering the father to pay $24,400 arrears at the rate of $100 per month where it failed to consider the purpose of child support, the welfare of the minor children, and the father's
                        ability to pay. Moreover, the father's voluntary payments were not a proper factor for consideration, and there was no basis in the law for punishing the mother for waiting for a year and two months to file a motion to force the

                            Status of Spouses Presents Mixed Questions of Law and Fact. - Determination of what constitutes a "dependent spouse" and what constitutes a "supporting spouse" requires an application of principles of statutory law to facts and involves mixed questions
                            of law and fact. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971).

                            To Be Determined by Trial Judge. - The issues of who is a "dependent spouse" and who is a "supporting spouse," within the meaning of this section, should be decided by the trial judge. Bennett v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite>                            680, 211 S.E.2d 835 (1975).

                        <p>
                            Defendant was not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of supporting and dependent spouse status, since issues of who is a dependent spouse and who is a supporting spouse are mixed questions of law and fact which can best be determined by the trial judge
                            when he sets the amount of permanent alimony. Vandiver v. Vandiver, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 274 S.E.2d 243, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 734</cite>, 280 S.E.2d

                            A supporting spouse is by definition married to a dependent spouse. Therefore, a determination that one spouse is a supporting spouse is a determination that the other is a dependent spouse and vice versa. Galloway v. Galloway,

                            Procedure Where Grounds for Alimony Are Asserted Simultaneously as Grounds for Divorce. - While it is true that the determination of dependency properly rests with the trial judge, and not with the jury, where the grounds asserted for alimony are asserted
                            simultaneously as grounds for divorce, the right to alimony depends on the legal entitlement to divorce, regardless of financial dependency. The ordinary and correct procedure in such cases, therefore, is to allow the jury
                            to render its verdict on the "fault" issues of divorce, and then and only then to move to a bench hearing on dependency and the proper amount, if any, of alimony. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite>                            405, 322 S.E.2d 427 (1984).

                        <p>
                            Consent Judgment Awarding Medical Expenses. - With the consent of the parties, the trial court, which has general jurisdiction of all domestic matters, could properly enter consent judgment, providing for payment of wife's medical payments, even though
                            it contained a provision which was outside of the pleadings. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 337 S.E.2d 190 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 375</cite>,
                            342 S.E.2d 893 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under consent judgment in which the court found as a fact that there were no claims for support or alimony pending between the parties and ordered plaintiff to pay all necessary and reasonable medical expenses incurred by defendant, parties did not intend
                            for medical expenses to constitute alimony payments; thus, the trial court erred in entering judgment ex meru motu declaring portions of consent judgment null and void and unenforceable ab initio and in striking them. Davis

                        <p>
                            As to meaning of "alimony," see Rogers v. Vines, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. 293</cite> (1846); Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 418</cite> (1885).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subdivision (1) Contemplates "Permanent Alimony". - While the word "permanent" is not included in the definition of "alimony" in subdivision (1) of this section, the definition obviously contemplates what is commonly referred to as "permanent alimony."
                            Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 174</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 849 (1980).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Intent to Include Lump Sum Awards. - The legislature clearly intended to include lump sum awards as well as periodic support in the statutory definition of alimony. McCall v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite>                            390, 285 S.E.2d 335, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 301</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 703 (1982).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial judge may award alimony in a lump payment or monthly payments. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 183 S.E.2d 428 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Or May Combine Forms of Payment. - The fact that a trial judge used a combination of both a lump sum payment and a continuing monthly payment for alimony does not constitute an abuse of discretion. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite>                            390, 183 S.E.2d 428 (1971).

                        <p>
                            An award of alimony for specified period only is indubitably alimony in gross or "lump sum alimony." Whitesell v. Whitesell, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 297 S.E.2d 172 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 583</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Award of Alimony Upheld. - Where the record revealed sufficient substantial evidence to permit a jury to find (1) that plaintiff was a "supporting spouse" and defendant was a "dependent spouse" as defined in this section, and (2) that plaintiff had abandoned
                            defendant and willfully failed to provide her with necessary subsistence according to his means and conditions, so as to render her condition intolerable and her life burdensome, these permissible findings would support an
                            award of alimony. Garner v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 178 S.E.2d 94 (1970).

                            The right of a wife to subsistence pending trial and to attorneys' fees was derived from the common law. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 183 S.E.2d 278 (1971).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Purpose of Pendente Lite Awards. - The remedy of subsistence and counsel fees pendente lite is intended to enable the wife to maintain herself according to her station in life and employ counsel to meet her husband at trial upon substantially equal terms.
                            Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 183 S.E.2d 278 (1971).

                            Amount of subsistence and counsel fees pendente lite is within the discretion of the court, but this discretion is limited by the factual conditions. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 183 S.E.2d

                            Pendente Lite Order Cannot Set Up Savings Account. - A pendente lite order is intended to go no further than provide subsistence and counsel fees pending the litigation. It cannot set up a savings account in favor of the plaintiff. Such is not the purpose
                            and it cannot be made the effect of an order. Yearwood v. Yearwood, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 254</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 95 (1975).

                            But Must Be Unable to Maintain Accustomed Standard of Living. - The legislative intent in the use of the phrase "actually substantially dependent" in subdivision (4) of this section is clear. This term implies that the spouse seeking alimony must have
                            actual dependence on the other in order to maintain standard of living in the manner to which that spouse had become accustomed during the last several years prior to separation. Thus, to qualify as a "dependent spouse" under
                            subdivision (3) of this section, one must be actually without the means of providing for his or her accustomed standard of living. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 174</cite>,
                            261 S.E.2d 849 (1980); Knott v. Knott, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 279 S.E.2d 72 (1981).

                            The term "accustomed standard of living of the parties" in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.5ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.5(a)</a></cite> completes the contemplated legislative meaning of "maintenance and support"
                            in subdivision (3) of this section. The latter phrase clearly means more than a level of mere economic survival. Plainly it contemplates the economic standard established by the marital partnership for the family unit during
                            the years in which the marital contract was intact. It anticipates that alimony, to the extent it can possibly do so, shall sustain that standard of living for the dependent spouse to which the parties together became accustomed.

                            When One Is a Dependent Spouse. - The dependency of the spouse asserting the claim may be established by proof that such spouse is either (a) actually substantially dependent upon the other spouse for his or her maintenance and support, or (b) substantially

                            Determination that one is a "dependent spouse" within the meaning of subdivision (3) of this section is a consequence of two or more related propositions taken as premises, one being the fact that the relationship of spouse exists, and the other consisting
                            of at least the finding that one of the two alternatives in subdivision (3) is a fact. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971); Presson v. Presson,

                            To find that one is a dependent spouse the trial court must make findings of fact sufficient to show (1) that a marital relationship between the parties exists; (2) either (a) that the spouse is actually substantially dependent upon the other spouse for
                            his or her maintenance and support, or (b) that the spouse is substantially in need of maintenance and support from the other spouse; and (3) that the supporting spouse is capable of making the payments required. Little v.

                            In determining whether one qualifies as a dependent spouse under subdivision (3) of this section, as well as in determining the amount of alimony to be awarded, the courts must consider the factors enumerated in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.5" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.5</a></cite>,
                            the section for determining the amount of alimony. These factors include the estates, earnings, earning capacity, condition, and accustomed standard of living of the parties, and other facts of the particular case. Beaman v.

                            To properly find a spouse dependent the court need only find that the spouse's reasonable monthly expenses exceed her monthly income and that the party has no other means with which to meet those expenses. Beaman v. Beaman,

                            Lack of Capacity or Reasonable Opportunity May Render Spouse Dependent. - A wife is actually substantially dependent upon her husband for her maintenance and support or in substantial need of support by him if she is incapable of adequately providing
                            for herself or is capable of adequately providing for herself but does not have a reasonable opportunity to do so. Galloway v. Galloway, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 253 S.E.2d

                            Where the trial court in an action for alimony pendente lite and permanent alimony found that plaintiff wife had been gainfully employed prior to her marriage to defendant and was "able-bodied, intelligent and capable to find employment," this finding
                            was not sufficient to support the trial court's conclusion that plaintiff was not a dependent spouse within the meaning of subdivision (3) of this section, as it did not include a finding that the plaintiff had a reasonable
                            opportunity but did not adequately support herself. Galloway v. Galloway, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 253 S.E.2d 41 (1979).

                            Accustomed Standard of Living Is Determinative. - It is not necessary that a spouse be reduced to penury to be considered dependent; the accustomed standard of living is the proper measure. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite>                            405, 322 S.E.2d 427 (1984).

                            For a spouse to be "actually substantially dependent", he or she must have actual dependence on the other in order to maintain the standard of living to which he or she became accustomed during the last several years prior to the spouses' separation.
                            To determine whether such actual dependence exists, the trial court must evaluate the parties' incomes and expenses measured by the standard of living of the family as a unit. Talent v. Talent,
                            <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 334 S.E.2d 256 (1985).

                        <p>
                            "Actually substantially dependent" means that the spouse seeking alimony must be actually dependent upon the other in order to maintain a standard of living in the manner to which that spouse had become accustomed during the last several years prior to
                            separation. Patterson v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 343 S.E.2d 595 (1986); Lamb v. Lamb, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 541, 406 S.E.2d 622 (1991).

                            A spouse is "actually substantially dependent" if he or she is without the means to provide for his or her accustomed standard of living. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 349 S.E.2d 397 (1986).

                        <p>
                            The term "actually substantially dependent," as used in the first portion of the definition in subdivision (3), means that the spouse seeking alimony must have actual dependence on the other in order to maintain the standard of living in the manner to
                            which that spouse became accustomed during the last several years prior to separation; thus to qualify as a dependent spouse under that portion of subdivision (3), the spouse seeking alimony must be actually without means for
                            providing for his or her accustomed standard of living. Caldwell v. Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 225, 356 S.E.2d 821, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 791</cite>,

                            Absent Actual Dependence, Issue Is Substantial Need of Maintenance. - If the court determines that one spouse is not actually dependent on the other for such support, the court must then determine if one spouse is "substantially in need of maintenance
                            and support" from the other, i.e., whether one spouse would be unable to maintain his or her accustomed standard of living, established prior to separation, without financial contribution from the other. In doing so, the court
                            must determine and consider the following: (1) The standard of living, socially and economically, to which the parties as a family unit became accustomed during the several years prior to their separation; (2) the present earnings,
                            prospective earning capacity, and any other condition, such as health, of each spouse at the time of the hearing; (3) whether the spouse seeking alimony has a demonstrated need for financial contribution from the other spouse
                            in order to maintain the parties' accustomed standard of living, taking into consideration the spouse's reasonable expenses in light of that standard of living; and (4) the financial worth or "estate" of both spouses. The court
                            must also consider fault and other facts of the particular case such as the length of the marriage and the contribution made by each spouse to the financial status of the family over the years. Talent v. Talent,
                            <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 334 S.E.2d 256 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Even if a spouse is not actually substantially dependent, he or she is nevertheless a dependent spouse under the second part of the definition of subdivision (3) of this section if, considering the parties' earnings, earning capacity, estates, and other
                            factors, the spouse seeking alimony demonstrates the need for financial contribution from the other spouse to maintain his or her accustomed standard of living. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite>                            228, 349 S.E.2d 397 (1986).

                            The test of being "substantially in need" refers to something less than being "actually substantially dependent." The analysis under this test is much more extensive and requires detailed and specific findings by the trial court. Patterson v. Patterson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 343 S.E.2d 595 (1986).

                            And Even Spouse Who Is Not "Actually Substantially Dependent" May Be Substantially in Need. - Even where a spouse is not "actually substantially dependent," the spouse may be a dependent spouse under the second part of subdivision (3) of this section
                            if he or she is substantially in need of maintenance and support, the meaning of which is determined by construing this statute in pari materia with the terms of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.5" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.5</a></cite>.
                            Lamb v. Lamb, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 541, 406 S.E.2d 622 (1991).

                            The phrase "substantially in need of" requires the spouse seeking alimony to establish that he or she would be unable to maintain his or her accustomed standard of living (established prior to separation) without financial contribution from the other.
                            Patterson v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 343 S.E.2d 595 (1986).

                            Maintenance of Accustomed Standard of Living by Borrowing. - The fact that a spouse can maintain his or her accustomed standard of living, by whatever means, pending the outcome of alimony litigation, does not determine the dependent spouse-supporting
                            spouse issue. A finding that a spouse was forced to borrow substantial funds in order to maintain her accustomed standard of living would ordinarily lead to the conclusion that she was a dependent spouse. Long v. Long,
                            <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 322 S.E.2d 427 (1984).

                            Whether Spouse Is "Dependent" or "Supporting" Must Be Based on Findings. - The conclusions made by the court as to whether a spouse is "dependent" or "supporting" must be based on findings of fact sufficiently specific to indicate that the court properly
                            considered the factors. In the absence of such findings, appellate courts cannot appropriately determine whether the order of the trial court is adequately supported by competent evidence, and therefore such an order must be
                            vacated and the case remanded for necessary findings. It is not enough that there is evidence in the record from which such findings could have been made because it is for the trial court, and not the appellate court, to determine
                            what facts are established by the evidence. Talent v. Talent, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 334 S.E.2d 256 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Findings that plaintiff wife worked and had a separate income did not preclude the trial court from determining that plaintiff was a dependent spouse and that defendant was a supporting spouse, where there was plenary evidence to show that wife was substantially
                            dependent upon defendant and in substantial need of his support. Radford v. Radford, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 569, 172 S.E.2d 897 (1970).

                            A finding that the wife is unemployed and that she has no income is not sufficient, where the sparse record does not foreclose the possibilities suggested in subdivision (3) of this section that the wife may be dependent upon and supported by someone
                            other than her husband or that she may not need any support at all. Manning v. Manning, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 201 S.E.2d 46 (1973).

                            Burden of proving dependency is upon the spouse asserting the claim for alimony or alimony pendente lite. Loflin v. Loflin, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 212 S.E.2d 403 (1975).

                        <p>
                            This section looks first to the ability of the spouses to maintain the standard of living to which they have become accustomed during the last years of the marriage. The burden on the applicant for alimony is to show the accustomed standard of living
                            and lack of means to maintain that standard. Only then does the ability of the other spouse to pay become significant. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 322 S.E.2d 427

                            The trial court must evaluate the parties' income and expenses measured by the standard of living of the family as a unit in order to determine if a spouse is "actually substantially dependent."

                            Discretion of Trial Court. - Once a trial court determines that a spouse is dependent and is entitled to alimony, its award will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion. Phillips v. Phillips,

                            Spouse Not Dependent. - Where there was no showing that plaintiff had a substantial need for support from defendant or to maintain plaintiff's accustomed station in life, she was in no sense a dependent spouse within the meaning of subdivision (3) of
                            this section. Lemons v. Lemons, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 303, 206 S.E.2d 327 (1974).

                            Trial court's conclusion that plaintiff wife was the "dependent spouse" entitled to support was not supported by findings of fact where the court found that defendant husband's income was "very significantly lower than same [had] been in the past" and
                            also that plaintiff was "unable to continue to maintain her accustomed station in life," but there was no finding or evidence that defendant deliberately depress his income in an effort to avoid his obligations, and it was
                            apparent that the trial court disregarded defendant's own inability to maintain the station in life to which he was formerly accustomed in its determination of dependency. Taylor v. Taylor,

                            Findings of fact supported by competent evidence of record fully supported the trial judge's conclusion that plaintiff was no longer a "dependent spouse", which conclusion supported his order terminating defendant's spousal support obligations, as only
                            a "dependent spouse" is entitled to alimony. Marks v. Marks, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 447</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 859 (1986).

                            Where the uncontradicted evidence disclosed that the year before the parties separated, the plaintiff had an income of $18,339.97 and the defendant had an income of $20,475.11, and the year they separated, the plaintiff's income was $19,301.46 and the
                            defendant's income was $24,447.26, and that during the last year that they lived together, they maintained separate bank accounts and divided household expenses, evidence did not support the ultimate finding that the plaintiff
                            was substantially and materially dependent upon the defendant for her support and maintenance, and the trial court erred in awarding the plaintiff alimony. Caldwell v. Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite>                            225, 356 S.E.2d 821, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 791</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 72 (1987).

                            Trial court did not err by finding wife's pleadings were insufficient on their face and dismissing her action for alimony pendente lite; plaintiff asserted in her complaint that she was a "dependent spouse," but the only support she offered for this conclusion
                            was evidence of her husband's salary and she did not present any evidence that she needed assistance to subsist during the prosecution or defense of the suit. Shook v.

                            Spouse Held Dependent. - Where defendant had not been regularly employed for 18 or 19 years prior to the separation and was completely supported by her husband, and her time was devoted to housework and rearing her children, it was clear from this evidence
                            that plaintiff was a dependent spouse within the purview of subdivision (3) of this section. Hudson v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 204 S.E.2d 697 (1974).

                        <p>
                            Where the evidence was not such as to require the court to find that defendant was capable of earning far greater income than she currently earned and showed that for the last five years of the parties' marriage defendant had earned insufficient income
                            to meet her reasonable needs, there was sufficient evidence to support the court's conclusion that defendant was a dependent spouse, and the court's findings that plaintiff 's net monthly income was $1,753 and that his reasonable
                            expenses were $1,242 were sufficient to support the conclusion that plaintiff was a supporting spouse. Beaman v. Beaman, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 717, 336 S.E.2d 129 (1985).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where plaintiff's budget of $2800 per month was both reasonable and commensurate with the standard of living which the couple maintained prior to the date of the separation, plaintiff had no income producing assets, but earned a net income of $1353 per
                            month, and defendant's gross income was nearly four times that of plaintiff, these findings supported trial court's determination that plaintiff was a dependent spouse and that defendant was a supporting spouse. Ellinwood v.

                            "Supporting Spouse" Defined. - A "supporting spouse" is a spouse, whether husband or wife, upon whom the other spouse is actually substantially dependent or from whom such other spouse is substantially in need of maintenance and support. A spouse meets
                            the definition if he or she qualifies under either test, which essentially is the same as that applied for "dependent spouse." The primary issue is not the supporting spouse's ability to pay, but whether the spouse seeking
                            alimony is a dependent spouse. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 322 S.E.2d 427 (1984).

                            Determination that one is a "supporting spouse" within the meaning of subdivision (4) of this section is a consequence of two or more related propositions taken as premises, one being that the relationship of spouse exists, and the other consisting of
                            the finding that one of the three (now two) alternatives in subdivision (4) is a fact. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971).

                    the issues involved in her suit. See Hodges v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 122</cite> (1880). In 1919, an amendment was added whereby the wife might apply for an allowance for her subsistence during the pendency of her main
                    action. See Laws 1919, c. 24.

                        Postseparation support, like alimony pendente lite, is intended to be only temporary and ceases when an award of alimony is either allowed or denied by the trial court. Wells v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite>                        401, 512 S.E.2d 468 (1999).

                        Termination of Postseparation Support. - Although the General Assembly may have intended postseparation support to be a temporary measure, the statutory definition of postseparation support provides for only three possible termination dates, the death
                        of either spouse or the remarriage of the receiving spouse. Marsh v. Marsh, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 663, 525 S.E.2d 476 (2000).

                        Postseparation Support After Divorce. - Postseparation support may continue despite a judgment of divorce if the postseparation support order does not specify a termination date and there is no court order awarding or denying alimony. Marsh v. Marsh,
                        <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 663, 525 S.E.2d 476 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in refusing to award the wife post-separation support pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1</a></cite>A(4) as a result of the wife's misconduct pursuant to

                        was sufficient, as it found that, while the husband was a supporting spouse, the wife forceably removed the husband from the house on two occasions under false domestic violence complaints and engaged in other improper behavior.

                        Postseparation Support Replaced Alimony Pendente Lite. - Postseparation support (PSS) effectively replaced alimony pendente lite and must in general operate under the same principle that entitlement findings by the trial court during a PSS hearing are
                        not final and binding at subsequent proceedings, since to treat PSS otherwise would deter many dependent spouses from seeking needed support for fear they would be bound by a ruling based on incomplete evidence. Wells v. Wells,
                        <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 401, 512 S.E.2d 468 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Postseparation Support. - Postseparation support is only intended to be temporary and ceases when an award of alimony is either allowed or denied by the trial court, and therefore is interlocutory and not appealable. Rowe v. Rowe,
                        <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 507 S.E.2d 317 (1998).

                    <p>
                        Trial court was not required to find a change of circumstances in entering an alimony order in a divorce case because at the time of the hearing, the only order in effect was a postseparation support order; the alimony award thus did not "modify" a prior
                        alimony order, but rather terminated an existing temporary postseparation support. Langdon v. Langdon, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 644 S.E.2d 600 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the trial court failed to make factual findings as to the parties' financial needs, accustomed standard of living, separate and marital debt obligations, and the expenses reasonably necessary to support each of them, its post-separation support
                        and alimony awards to the husband under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a), (b), and (c) were reversed. Crocker v. Crocker, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite>                        165, 660 S.E.2d 212 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in its calculation of a wife's income because it calculated her average net income even though there was no evidence in the record to suggest that she was depressing her income; if the trial included post-separation support (PSS) the
                        wife received from the husband, that would also constitute error, because (PSS), which eventually terminated upon the occurrence of specified events, was not permanent income. Carpenter v. Carpenter,
                        <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 781 S.E.2d 828 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Dependent Spouse. - Where the trial court found that the ex-husband had a net monthly income of approximately $5,400 and reasonable monthly expenses in the amount of $4,200, yielding a surplus of $1,200, and the ex-wife's reasonable needs exceeded her
                        income by $1,400, there was no abuse of discretion in finding the ex-wife was a dependent spouse and the ex-husband was a supporting spouse and awarding the ex-wife $1,200 per month in alimony. Rhew v. Felton,
                        <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 631 S.E.2d 859, appeal dismissed, review denied, 636 S.E.2d 810 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Evidence supported the finding that the wife was a dependent spouse and the husband was a supporting spouse pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1</a></cite>A, where the findings of
                        fact demonstrated that, during the marriage and at the time of the hearing, the wife had an income-expenses deficit of $627.00 per month and the husband had an income-expense surplus. Helms v. Helms, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite>                        19, 661 S.E.2d 906 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 681</cite>, 670 S.E.2d 233 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in granting a wife's motion to dismiss a husband's alimony claim on the grounds that he failed to reply to the wife's counterclaims because the allegations set forth in the wife's counterclaims, and reiterated in a finding of fact in
                        the trial court's order, were merely denials in affirmative form of the allegations of the complaint, and the trial court erred in deeming admitted the allegations in the wife's counterclaim that the husband was not a dependent
                        spouse and that he was not a supporting spouse; a plaintiff is not required to re-allege those allegations in a complaint that have been "denied in the affirmative" by way of a counterclaim by a defendant. Crowley v. Crowley,
                        <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 691 S.E.2d 727 (2010), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 324</cite>, 700 S.E.2d 749, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 591 (2010).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err by determining a wife was not a "dependent spouse" for purposes of alimony, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1</a></cite>A(2) and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a),
                        because there was a surplus left to the wife each month, after deducting all of the wife's expenses from her net monthly income; the wife's "change in lifestyles" argument in support of alimony was rejected because the wife's previous
                        standard of living was "artificially inflated" by a massive infusion of debt. Bodie v. Bodie, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 727 S.E.2d 11 (2012).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was not error to find a wife was a dependent spouse and a husband was a supporting spouse, for post-separation support, because the court sufficiently found the parties' incomes and marital living standard. Collins v. Collins,
                        <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 696, 778 S.E.2d 854 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in concluding that a wife was not a dependent spouse because it failed to determine which, if any, of the wife's expenditures were reasonable in light of her accustomed standard of living during the parties' marriage and to engage in
                        the necessary comparison of those reasonable expenses to a correct calculation of her income. Carpenter v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 781 S.E.2d 828 (2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the trial court heard both the alimony claim and the equitable distribution claims simultaneously, it had to determine the final equitable distribution prior to determining alimony; presuming the record supported the wife's contention that the husband
                        was a supporting spouse, the trial court had to determine whether the husband was a supporting spouse if it concludes on remand that the wife was a dependent spouse. Carpenter v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite>                        1, 781 S.E.2d 828 (2016).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Date of Separation. - Trial court did not err in finding a husband and wife were not separated at the time of the wife's marital misconduct, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1</a></cite>A(3)(a),
                        thereby precluding an award of alimony to the wife under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a), because even though there was some physical separation of the parties after a choking
                        incident involving the parties' son, neither party expressed to the other they wanted to separate and the husband continued to maintain all of his belongings at the marital residence; although the phrase "the date of separation"
                        as used in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a) was not defined, the phrase "separate and apart" as used in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-6" target="_self">G.S. 50-6</a></cite>                        meant there had to be a physical separation and an intention on the part of at least one of the parties to cease matrimonial cohabitation. Romulus v. Romulus, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 715 S.E.2d 308 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Finding of Marital Misconduct as Related to Alimony. - Where trial court specifically found, while addressing the alimony issue, that despite the marital misconduct of the wife, she should be given credit for her career sacrifices that no doubt helped
                        the husband succeed in his military goals, the trial court thereby fully addressed the question of the wife's misconduct as it related to alimony. Cunningham v. Cunningham, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite>                        550, 615 S.E.2d 675 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Even though a husband admitted to marital misconduct, in the form of breaking his wife's arm, and physically and verbally abusing the parties' minor children, a trial court properly determined the wife was not entitled to alimony under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a) because the wife had engaged in uncondoned illicit sexual behavior with another man, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1</a></cite>A(3)(a),
                        including sexual intercourse or sexual acts, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa7As14-27.1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-27.1(4)</a></cite>.

                        If a wife had to show a lack of adequate provocation for a husband's indignities, for alimony purposes, any failure to satisfy this requirement did not warrant reversal of an alimony award because (1) the husband did not raise the issue below, (2) the
                        husband did not show provocation, and (3) the trial court's findings demonstrated that the wife did not provoke the husband's abuse. Dechkovskaia v. Dechkovskaia, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite>                        350, 754 S.E.2d 831 (2014), review denied, 758 S.E.2d 870, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 436 (2014).

                        Competent evidence showed a husband subjected a wife to indignities because a guardian ad litem report, to which the husband did not object for alimony purposes, demonstrated such indignities. Dechkovskaia v. Dechkovskaia,
                        <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 754 S.E.2d 831 (2014), review denied, 758 S.E.2d 870, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 436 (2014).

                        Trial court properly denied a wife's request for post-separation support based on marital misconduct because the wife abandoned the husband by discontinuing the marital cohabitation without just cause or excuse, leaving the marital home, depositing the
                        husband's belongings at their son's house, and telling the husband that she had found someone else and did not want him anymore, and the husband's failure to object did not constitute consent. Sorey v. Sorey,

                        Husband's motion to dismiss a wife's claim that he had engaged in "marital misconduct" was not properly presented by his appeal; where an unsuccessful motion to dismiss is grounded on an alleged insufficiency of the facts to state a claim for relief,
                        and the case proceeds to judgment on the merits, the unsuccessful movant cannot on an appeal from the final judgment seek review of the denial of the motion to dismiss.

                        Evidence supported the trial court's findings of fact regarding indignities, and it properly did not make any findings regarding condonation of the indignities because the husband did not present any evidence that the wife ever had sufficient knowledge
                        of his actions to condone them; when the wife became aware of husband's actions she objected and asked him to stop, but he continued his behavior surreptitiously. Gilmartin v.

                        Sufficiency of Findings by the Trial Court. - Reversal and remand of a trial court's order was appropriate because the court had to enter additional findings concerning the parties' expenses as the court's alimony order did not include any findings as
                        to the wife's expenses. Kabasan v. Kabasan, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 436, 810 S.E.2d 691 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Insurance. - Since a trial court may order a supporting spouse to make homeowner's and automobile insurance payments on behalf of a dependent spouse, even though such payments are not explicitly authorized under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1</a></cite>A(a)

                        Description of Property Met Requirements. - Trial court's findings included a description of the real property owned by the parties and their personal savings; contrary to the husband's claim, the findings met the requirements of

                            Lack of Grounds. - The plain and definite meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.11" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.11</a></cite> is that when a jury or trial judge finds that none of the grounds on which a spouse
                            alleges entitlement to permanent alimony pursuant to G.S. 50-15.2 exists, the trial court, in its discretion, may order recoupment of any alimony pendente lite paid by the supporting spouse.

                            Effect of Voluntary Dismissal with Prejudice. - Defendant wife's voluntary dismissal with prejudice of her suit for permanent alimony based on adultery and abandonment amounted to a concession that none of the grounds entitling her to permanent alimony
                            existed and resulted in a final judgment on the merits with res judicata implications; the case would therefor be remanded for a hearing to consider whether husband should recoup the alimony pendente lite paid. Riviere v. Riviere,

                            Procedure Where Grounds for Alimony Are Asserted Simultaneously as Grounds for Divorce. - While it is true that the determination of dependency properly rests with the trial judge, and not with the jury, where the grounds asserted for alimony are asserted
                            simultaneously as grounds for divorce, the right to alimony depends on the legal entitlement to divorce, regardless of financial dependency. The ordinary and correct procedure in such cases, therefore, is to allow the jury
                            to render its verdict on the "fault" issues of divorce, and then and only then to move to a bench hearing on dependency and the proper amount, if any, of alimony. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite>                            405, 322 S.E.2d 427 (1984).

                            Equitable Distribution Decided Before Permanent Alimony. - When both permanent alimony and equitable distribution are requested, the equitable distribution should be decided first.

                            Identification of Support Payments. - Whether support payments are in fact alimony does not depend on whether order refers to it as "alimony" but instead on whether support payments constitute "reciprocal consideration" for property settlement provision
                            of order. Hayes v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 394 S.E.2d 675 (1990).

                            An alimony award should follow equitable distribution, duly taking into account the division of the marital property and the resulting estates of the parties. Patterson v.

                            To be entitled to alimony, a spouse must not only have one of the grounds set forth in this section, he or she must also be a "dependent spouse." Talent v. Talent, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 334 S.E.2d 256

                            Only Dependent Spouse Is Entitled to Alimony or Alimony Pendente Lite. - Only a dependent spouse is entitled to alimony in North Carolina. Fink v. Fink, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 462 S.E.2d 844 (1995).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The statutory policy behind the requirement that only a "dependent spouse" is entitled to alimony is to protect a nonsupporting spouse from serious economic harm by making payments to a spouse who does not need support. Fact that defendant husband agreed
                            to pay monthly alimony was proof that he needed no further protection. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 245 S.E.2d 94 (1978).

                        <p>
                            For a spouse to be "actually substantially dependent" upon the other spouse, he or she must have actual dependence on the other in order to maintain the standard of living to which he or she became accustomed during the last several years prior to the
                            spouses' separation. To determine whether such actual dependence exists, the trial court must evaluate the parties' incomes and expenses measured by the standard of living of the family as a unit. Talent v. Talent,
                            <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 334 S.E.2d 256 (1985).

                            Conclusions as to "Dependent" or "Supporting" Status Must Be Based on Findings. - The conclusions made by the court as to whether a spouse is "dependent" or "supporting" must be based on findings of fact sufficiently specific to indicate that the court
                            properly considered the factors. In the absence of such findings, appellate courts cannot appropriately determine whether the order of the trial court is adequately supported by competent evidence, and therefore such an order
                            must be vacated and the case remanded for necessary findings. It is not enough that there is evidence in the record from which such findings could have been made because it is for the trial court, and not the appellate court,
                            to determine what facts are established by the evidence. Talent v. Talent, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 334 S.E.2d 256 (1985).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Absent Actual Dependence, Issue Is Substantial Need of Maintenance. - If the court determines that one spouse is not actually dependent on the other for such support, the court must then determine if one spouse is "substantially in need of maintenance
                            and support" from the other, i.e., whether one spouse would be unable to maintain his or her accustomed standard of living, established prior to separation, without financial contribution from the other. In doing so, the court
                            must determine and consider the following: (1) The standard of living, socially and economically, to which the parties as a family unit became accustomed during the several years prior to their separation; (2) the present earnings,
                            prospective earning capacity, and any other condition, such as health, of each spouse at the time of the hearing; (3) whether the spouse seeking alimony has a demonstrated need for financial contribution from the other spouse
                            in order to maintain the parties' accustomed standard of living, taking into consideration the spouse's reasonable expenses in light of that standard of living; and (4) the financial worth or "estate" of both spouses. The court
                            must also consider fault and other facts of the particular case such as the length of the marriage and the contribution made by each spouse to the financial status of the family over the years. Talent v. Talent,
                            <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 334 S.E.2d 256 (1985).

                            Effect of Consent Judgment on Dependency Requirement. - A finding of dependency is not required where judgments ordering payment of alimony are entered by consent. Allison v. Allison, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite>                            622, 277 S.E.2d 551, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 543</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 660 (1981).

                        <p>
                            "Supporting Spouse" Defined. - A "supporting spouse" is a spouse, whether husband or wife, upon whom the other spouse is actually substantially dependent or from whom such other spouse is substantially in need of maintenance and support. A spouse meets
                            the definition if he or she qualifies under either test, which essentially is the same as that applied for "dependent spouse." The primary issue is not the supporting spouse's ability to pay, but whether the spouse seeking
                            alimony is a dependent spouse. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 322 S.E.2d 427 (1984).

         Enforcement of Duty of Support.
        </b> - The law imposes a continuing legal duty upon a husband to support his wife. Such duty is enforceable in a variety of ways: through criminal sanctions imposed for willful abandonment coupled with nonsupport, and
                            through civil decrees granting alimony, alimony pendente lite, or alimony without divorce on the basis of misconduct or failure to support. Gray v. Snyder, 704 F.2d 709 (4th Cir. 1983).

         Attempt to Limit Duty of Support.
        </b> - Husband's duty of support is considered to be so fraught with a public interest that any contractual undertaking between a husband and wife who are living together and not contemplating imminent separation, which

                            An order of alimony without divorce and child support is temporary in nature, and if future circumstances justify a change, defendant is at liberty to seek relief in the trial court by motion in the cause. Fonvielle v. Fonvielle,

                            In a wife's action for alimony without divorce and for child support, the Court of Appeals will not disturb an order of the trial court requiring the husband to make substantial payments to the wife for alimony and for support of the minor children, notwithstanding

                            Effect of Reconciliation or Death of Party. - Alimony is in its nature a provision for a wife (now spouse) separated from her husband (spouse) and it cannot continue after reconciliation or the death of either party. Rogers v. Vines,

                            condition, so as to render her condition intolerable and her life burdensome, these permissible findings would support an award of alimony. Garner v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 178 S.E.2d 94 (1970).

                            In suits for alimony, the order granting alimony must contain one of the 10 grounds for alimony listed in this section as a conclusion of law. Findings of fact to support that conclusion must be made, and usually the finding or findings of fact necessary
                            will involve the actions of the supporting spouse. Steele v. Steele, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 244 S.E.2d 466 (1978).

                            respect to the accustomed standard of living during the marriage and, instead, simply made findings regarding the separate "estates" of the parties during the marriage; as the point in evaluating the parties' accustomed standard
                            of living was to consider the pooling of resources that marriage allowed, the trial court's findings were insufficient. Rice v. Rice, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 487, 584 S.E.2d 317 (2003).

                            the accustomed standard of living and lack of means to maintain that standard. Only then does the ability of the other spouse to pay become significant. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite>                            405, 322 S.E.2d 427 (1984).

                            To determine whether the dependent spouse was entitled to alimony and, if so, in what amount, the trial judge was required to weigh evidence of adultery by the supporting spouse as well as evidence of indignities offered by both the supporting and the

                            Three Distinct Elements Must Be Proven. - It has been held that one spouse abandons the other, within the meaning of this statute, where he or she brings their cohabitation to an end without justification, without the consent of the other spouse and without
                            intent of renewing it. This definition establishes three distinct elements which must be proven by the dependent spouse to entitle her to alimony on the basis of abandonment. Murray v. Murray,

                            Case-by-Case Determination. - Since there is no all-inclusive definition as to what will justify abandonment, each case must be determined in large measure upon its own circumstances.

                            "Constructive Abandonment". - One spouse may abandon the other without physically leaving the home. In that event, the physical departure of the other spouse from the home is not an abandonment by that spouse. The constructive abandonment by the defaulting
                            spouse may consist of either affirmative acts of cruelty or of a willful failure, as by a willful failure to provide adequate support. Panhorst v. Panhorst, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 664</cite>,
                            178 S.E.2d 387 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is no willful failure, and thus no constructive abandonment, where the defect of which the departing spouse complains is due to the illness or physical disability of the remaining spouse and his or her consequent inability to act. Panhorst v. Panhorst,
                            <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 664</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 387 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Constructive abandonment may be shown by mental or physical cruelty or willful failure of the defaulting spouse to fulfill obligations of the marriage. Ellinwood v. Ellinwood, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 119,

                        <p>
                            Proof of constructive abandonment may not be based on evidence of actions after the parties separated. Ellinwood v. Ellinwood, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 362 S.E.2d 584 (1987).

                            Abandonment Requires That Separation Be Done Willfully. - A contention that abandonment imports willfulness is an exercise in semantics. To the contrary, abandonment requires that the separation or withdrawal be done willfully and without just cause or
                            provocation. Mode v. Mode, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 174 S.E.2d 30 (1970).

                        <p>
                            The causes leading to the abandonment are relevant and proper subjects for inquiry in an action for alimony without divorce based upon the husband's abandonment. Mode v. Mode, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 174

                            When Spouse Is Justified in Leaving. - Ordinarily the withdrawing spouse is not justified in leaving the other unless the conduct of the latter is such as would likely render it impossible for the withdrawing spouse to continue the marital relation with
                            safety, health, and self-respect. Patton v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 247, 337 S.E.2d 607 (1985), rev'd in part on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 404</cite>,

                            Maintenance of Nuisance May Be Adequate Provocation for Subsequent Abandonment. - The maintenance of numbers of dogs and cats, constituting a nuisance to the plaintiff, may be adequate provocation on the part of the defendant for the subsequent abandonment
                            of the defendant by the plaintiff. Therrell v. Therrell, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 321, 198 S.E.2d 776 (1973).

                            Providing of Support Does Not Negative Abandonment. - The husband's willful failure to provide adequate support for his wife may be evidence of his abandonment of her, but the mere fact that he provides adequate support for her does not in itself negative
                            abandonment as that term is used in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-7" target="_self">G.S. 50-7(1)</a></cite>. Richardson v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 538</cite>, 151 S.E.2d

                            A wife is entitled to her husband's society and the protection of his name and home in cohabitation. The permanent denial of these rights may be aggravated by leaving her destitute or may be mitigated by a liberal provision for her support, but if the
                            cohabitation is brought to an end without justification, without the consent of the wife and without the intention of renewing it, the matrimonial offense of desertion is complete. Richardson v. Richardson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 538</cite>, 151 S.E.2d 12 (1966), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>.

                            A husband may be deemed to have abandoned his wife within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-7" target="_self">G.S. 50-7(1)</a></cite>, and thus be liable for alimony, notwithstanding the fact that, after
                            cohabitation is brought to an end, he voluntarily provides her with adequate support. Whether his withdrawal from the home, followed by such support, constitutes an abandonment which is ground for suit by the wife for divorce
                            from bed and board, and therefore ground for suit by her for alimony without divorce, depends upon whether his withdrawal from the home was justified by the conduct of the wife. Schloss v. Schloss, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 266</cite>,
                            160 S.E.2d 5 (1968), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>.

                            Voluntary abandonment of husband by wife without legal justification will not entitle her to alimony in her suit for divorce from bed and board. McManus v. McManus, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 740</cite>, 133 S.E. 9 (1926).

                            A wife who has abandoned her husband without just cause or who, by her wrongful conduct, has forced him to leave home, has no right to alimony. Parker v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 176</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 174 (1964).

                            Husband May Prove as Defense That Wife Separated Herself from Him. - In an action by a wife for alimony without divorce, this section does not preclude the husband, who has left the home, from proving as a defense that it was actually the wife who separated
                            herself from him though she did not leave the home. Panhorst v. Panhorst, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 664</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 387 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the pleadings place in issue the crucial question of whether the husband has separated himself from the wife, there is nothing in the language or meaning of the statute which precludes the husband from proving as a defense that in point of fact
                            and in legal contemplation it was the wife who separated herself from the husband. Caddell v. Caddell, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 686</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 923 (1953).

                        <p>
                            Where in his answer defendant alleged that he separated himself from his wife at her bidding after an altercation to avoid continual abuse, nagging and assaults by plaintiff, and that he had provided plaintiff and their children with a furnished house,
                            paid bills for necessaries and given them cash weekly, and had theretofore furnished them with necessary subsistence in accordance with his means in life, the answer raised issues of fact determinative of the right to the relief
                            sought, which issues had to be submitted to the jury, and the granting of plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings was error. Masten v. Masten, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 24</cite>, 3

                            Consent to Departure Not Shown. - Where the evidence at most disclosed a marital relationship that was sometimes rocky and a sexual relationship which, in the husband's estimation, left something to be desired, and the trial court's findings, based upon
                            competent evidence, were that throughout the marriage the wife was a capable homemaker and good mother, that the couple enjoyed recreational activities with family and mutual friends, and that when problems arose in the relationship,
                            the wife sought counseling for the couple, the wife met her burden of proof for lack of justification for the husband's departure; and the fact that the wife had, in effect, given husband an ultimatum to either faithfully commit
                            to the marriage or to "make a clean break" did not mean that as a legal matter she consented to the termination of their cohabitation. Patton v.

                            Cruelty Causing Wife to Leave Home. - When the husband by cruel treatment renders the life of the wife intolerable or puts her in such fear for her safety that she is compelled to leave the home, the abandonment is his, and is sufficient ground for alimony
                            without divorce. Eggleston v. Eggleston, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 668</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 243 (1948).

                            Plaintiff May Rely on Cumulative Effect of Many Years of Mistreatment. - In an action for alimony without divorce, the plaintiff has the right to rely on the cumulative effect of many years of mistreatment by the husband, and her testimony cannot be limited
                            to events which occurred immediately prior to the alleged abandonment. Mode v. Mode, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 174 S.E.2d 30 (1970).

                            Allegations on Ground of Abandonment. - The plaintiff in an action for alimony without divorce on the ground of abandonment is not required to allege the acts and conduct relied upon as the basis of the action with that degree of particularity as is required
                            when the cause of action is based on such indignities to the person as to render her condition intolerable and her life burdensome. Richardson v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite>                            99, 165 S.E.2d 678 (1969).

                            The fundamental characteristic of indignities is that it must consist of a course of conduct or continued treatment which renders the condition of the injured party intolerable and life burdensome. The indignities must be repeated and persisted in over
                            a period of time. Traywick v. Traywick, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 221 S.E.2d 85 (1976).

                            What Constitutes Indignities Depends upon Circumstances. - The acts of a husband which will constitute such indignities to the person of his wife as to render her condition intolerable and her life burdensome largely depend upon the facts and circumstances
                            in each particular case. And such facts and circumstances are for the jury to pass upon, unaffected by any temporary order entered for subsistence and attorneys' fees. Barwick v. Barwick, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 109</cite>,

                            In cases involving alimony without divorce on the grounds that the supporting spouse has offered such indignities to the dependent spouse as to render his or her condition intolerable and his or her life burdensome, the Supreme Court has not set an undeviating
                            rule as to what constitutes such indignities, but leaves it to the courts to deal with each particular case and to determine it upon its own peculiar circumstances. Presson v. Presson, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite>                            109, 182 S.E.2d 614 (1971).

                        <p>
                            While husband often neglected his wife while participating in rescue squad activities, and on occasion called her names in public, thus contributing to his wife's suspicions and irritation, his conduct was not such as to cause her condition to become
                            intolerable and her life burdensome. Furthermore, the husband did not abandon his wife, but left the marital residence for "just cause" (wife's criticism and accusations). Therefore, the wife was not entitled to alimony as
                            a matter of law. Puett v. Puett, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 331 S.E.2d 287 (1985).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the wife is compelled to leave the home of the husband because he offers such indignities to her person as to render her condition intolerable and her life burdensome, his acts constitute in law an abandonment of the wife by the husband, and allegations
                            to this effect are sufficient to state a cause of action for alimony without divorce. Barwick v. Barwick, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 109</cite>, 44 S.E.2d 597 (1947).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A wife is not always entitled to alimony when her husband "threatens" her, however mildly, on several occasions. Traywick v. Traywick, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 221 S.E.2d 85 (1976).

                            Sexual cohabitation after acts of cruelty cannot be considered as condonation in the sense in which it would be after an act of adultery. The effort to endure unkind treatment as long as possible is commendable; and it is obviously a just rule that the
                            patient endurance by one spouse of the continuing ill treatment of the other should never be allowed to weaken his or her right to relief under subdivision (7) of this section. Privette v. Privette,

                            Complaint Merely Alleging Cruelty and Indignities Fails to Give Fair Notice. - Where the complaint merely alleges that the defendant treated the plaintiff cruelly and offered indignities to her person but does not refer to any transactions, occurrences
                            or series of transactions or occurrences intended to be proved, nor mention any specific act of cruelty or indignity committed by the defendant, the alleged cruelty and alleged indignities may consist of nothing more than occasional
                            nagging of the plaintiff or pounding on a table. Such a complaint does not give defendant fair notice of plaintiff's claim. Manning v. Manning, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 201

                        Separation Required for Claim of Postseparation Support. - Trial court correctly dismissed a wife's claim for spousal support based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, in order to maintain a claim for postseparation support under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.2" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.2</a></cite>A, the parties had to be separated, and the record showed that the parties were still married and living in the marital residence with their minor

                        Income Calculation. - Although a trial court, in determining alimony, properly considered a wife's present employment income, in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.2" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.2</a></cite>A(b),
                        and not the wife's expected decrease in pay, the trial court erroneously included the wife's tax refund in the calculation of her regular income. Williamson v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 719 S.E.2d

                        Summary judgment was appropriate where a premarital agreement signed by the parties irrefutably barred the wife's claims for postseparation support, alimony and equitable distribution; the language in the subject agreement - drafted by the wife's attorney
                        - was sufficiently "express" to constitute a valid and enforceable waiver of the wife's claims for postseparation support pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.2" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.2</a></cite>A

                        was sufficient, as it found that, while the husband was a supporting spouse, the wife forceably removed the husband from the house on two occasions under false domestic violence complaints and engaged in other improper behavior.

                        Trial court erred in denying a wife's request for postseparation support because the court made no factual findings supporting the court's reasons. Nicks v. Nicks, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 487, 774 S.E.2d 365

                        Order Supported by Evidence. - Order of postseparation support was supported by evidence that the husband's income from interest, dividends, capital gains, and partnerships averaged $622,136 per year. Squires v. Squires,
                        <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 631 S.E.2d 156 (2006).

                    <p>
                        It was not error to find a wife was a dependent spouse and a husband was a supporting spouse, for post-separation support, because the court sufficiently found the parties' incomes and marital living standard. Collins v. Collins,
                        <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 696, 778 S.E.2d 854 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Contempt. - Findings of fact and conclusion of law in a civil contempt order were insufficient. The trial court had failed to make findings regarding <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005A.html#t5Aa02s5A-21ol1a1" target="_blank">G.S. 5A-21(a)(1)</a></cite>                        and (2); there were no findings regarding defendant's present ability to pay postseparation support; and the statement that the support order was interlocutory was not a conclusion of law. Thompson v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite>                        515, 735 S.E.2d 214 (2012).

                    <p>
                        When the trial court ordered defendant to either pay plaintiff $400 or serve thirty days in jail for willfully refusing to pay postseparation support to plaintiff, the action was for defendant's failure to comply with the trial court's previous order,
                        and it was evident that the trial court was exercising its contempt power to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order. Therefore, this was a contempt order, and it was civil contempt. Thompson

                        Support Denied When Spouse Discontinued Cohabitation Without Just Cause. - Trial court properly denied a wife's request for post-separation support based on marital misconduct because the wife abandoned the husband by discontinuing the marital cohabitation
                        without just cause or excuse, leaving the marital home, depositing the husband's belongings at their son's house, and telling the husband that she had found someone else and did not want him anymore, and the husband's failure to
                        object did not constitute consent. Sorey v. Sorey, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 682, 757 S.E.2d 518 (2014).

                        Abuse of Discretion. - Former husband failed to show that a trial court abused its discretion by including the husband's Federal Employees Retirement Savings benefits in its post-separation support order and later distributing a portion of those benefits
                        to the wife. Kabasan v. Kabasan, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 436, 810 S.E.2d 691 (2018).

                    Editor's Note. - It was formerly held that alimony pendente lite could not be awarded in the absence of a statute conferring this power. Wilson v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 377</cite> (1837); Reeves v. Reeves, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 348</cite>                    (1880). In 1852, the legislature passed an act authorizing the courts, upon a petition for divorce and alimony, to decree the petitioner a sum sufficient for her support during the pendency of the suit. See Everton v. Everton,
                    <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. 202</cite> (1857). In Medlin v. Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 529</cite>, 95 S.E. 857 (1918), the court overruled the former doctrine mentioned above, and stated that the courts possessed the
                    right to grant alimony pendente lite by virtue of the common law, the practice having come down from the English ecclesiastical courts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The effect of this holding was to make the statute remedial in its nature, affirmative in its terms and cumulative in its effect, not abrogating the common law existent on the subject nor withdrawing from the court any powers already possessed in administering
                    its principles. Medlin v. Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 529</cite>, 95 S.E. 857 (1918), overruling Reeves v. Reeves, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 348</cite> (1880), on this point.

                    Session Laws 1995, c. 319, which repealed this section, in section 12 provides that the act applies to civil motions filed on or after that date, and shall not apply to pending litigation, or to future motions in the cause seeking to modify orders or

                            to plaintiff in her action for alimony without divorce were unconstitutional as depriving him of a property right without trial by jury was untenable, since he was under the duty to support plaintiff until the adjudication
                            of issues relieving him of that duty, and since such allowance by the court did not form any part of the ultimate relief sought nor affect the final rights of the parties. Peele v. Peele, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 298</cite>,

                            Right to Alimony Pending Trial Is Grounded on Common Law. - The right of a defendant wife to an allowance for her subsistence pending trial and for counsel fees in a suit for absolute divorce by her husband was not derived from former G.S. 50-15 or 50-16,
                            but was grounded on the common law. Branon v. Branon, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 77</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 209 (1957).

                            Allowance as a Legal Right. - Generally, excluding statutory grounds for denial, allowance of support to an indigent wife (dependent spouse) while prosecuting a meritorious suit against her husband (supporting spouse) under this section is so strongly
                            entrenched in practice as to be considered an established legal right. Butler v. Butler, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 594</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 745 (1946); Yow v. Yow, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 79</cite>,

                            Purpose of alimony pendente lite is to give a dependent spouse immediate support and allow her to maintain her action. Giving supporting spouse credit for equitable distribution purposes for various payments made as part of alimony pendente lite would
                            defeat the purpose of alimony pendente lite by penalizing the dependent spouse in the final distribution of the marital assets. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 367

                            When the wife (dependent spouse) is the defendant she has a right to claim alimony pendente lite. Webber v. Webber, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. 572</cite> (1878); Barker v. Barker, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 316</cite>,
                            48 S.E. 733 (1904).

                        <p>
                            Since the decision to the contrary in Reeves v. Reeves, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 348</cite> (1980), is expressly abrogated in Medlin v. Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 529</cite>, 95 S.E. 857 (1918), the wife (dependent
                            spouse) may be allowed alimony pending the action and counsel fees in a suit against her for divorce, even though she seeks no affirmative relief and merely endeavors to defeat her husband's (supporting spouse's) case. It follows,
                            therefore, that in an action by the husband for an absolute divorce, the wife may deny the validity of the cause of action alleged by the husband, or plead an affirmative defense to it, and obtain upon a proper showing in either
                            event allowances from the estate or earnings of the husband for her support during the pendency of the action and for counsel fees for her attorneys. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 383</cite>, 75 S.E.2d
                            109 (1953).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the husband (supporting spouse) sues the wife (dependent spouse) for an absolute divorce, the wife may plead a cause of action for divorce from bed and board as a cross-action, and obtain upon a proper showing allowances from the estate or earnings
                            of her husband for her support during the pendency of the action and for counsel fees for her attorneys. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 383</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 109 (1953).

                        <p>
                            And this is true although she may be concluded by the judgment against her in her former and independent action for divorce a mensa under the provisions of the statute. Medlin v. Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 529</cite>,
                            95 S.E. 857 (1918).

                            Lapse of seven years from the time of the separation does not bar a cross-action for divorce a mensa on the ground of constructive abandonment or application for alimony pendente lite, either by laches or any statute of limitation. Nall v. Nall,
                            <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 598</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 737 (1948).

                            Purpose of support pendente lite is to provide for the reasonable and proper support of the wife (dependent spouse) in an emergency situation, pending the final determination of her rights. Schloss v. Schloss, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 266</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The purpose of alimony pendente lite is to provide the dependent spouse with reasonable living expenses during the pendency of litigation. Roberts v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 226 S.E.2d 400 (1976).

                        <p>
                            The purpose of temporary alimony is to enable the dependent spouse to maintain herself according to her accustomed station in life pending the final determination of the issues. Gardner v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite>                            334, 252 S.E.2d 867 (1979).

                            So That She May Maintain Her Action. - The granting of alimony pendente lite is given by statute for the very purpose that the wife (dependent spouse) have immediate support and be able to maintain her action. It is a matter of urgency. Williams v. Williams,
                            <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 48</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 227 (1964); Brady v. Brady, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 299</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 13 (1968).

                            And to Place Her on a More Equal Footing. - The purpose of the speedy proceedings for alimony pendente lite is to give the dependent spouse subsistence and counsel fees pending trial of the action on its merits. This result places the dependent spouse
                            on a more nearly equal footing with the supporting spouse for purposes of preparing for and prosecuting the dependent spouse's claim. Black v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 403,

                            The remedy established for the subsistence of the wife (dependent spouse) pending the trial and final determination of the issues involved and for her counsel fees is intended to enable her to maintain herself according to her station in life and to have
                            sufficient funds to employ adequate counsel to meet her husband (supporting spouse) at the trial upon substantially equal terms. Fogartie v. Fogartie, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 188</cite>, 72

                            While Affording Some Protection to Supporting Spouse. - The purpose of former G.S. 50-15 was to afford the wife (dependent spouse) present pecuniary relief pending the progress of the action, and to afford the husband (supporting spouse) some measure
                            of protection in a motion so important, which was made and to be determined before the merits of the controversy were ascertained and the rights of the parties settled regularly by final judgment. Morris v. Morris,

                            Purpose Is Not to Determine Rights. - The purpose of a hearing for alimony pendente lite is to give the dependent spouse reasonable subsistence pending trial and without delay. It is not to determine property rights or finally determine what alimony the
                            dependent spouse may receive if she wins her case on the merits. Harrell v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 758</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 728 (1961); Kohler v. Kohler, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite>                            339, 204 S.E.2d 177 (1974).

                            Nor to Establish Savings Account for Dependent Spouse. - The purpose of alimony pendente lite is to provide for the reasonable support of the dependent spouse pending final determination of her rights, and not to establish a savings account for her. Gardner
                            v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 252 S.E.2d 867 (1979).

                            A pendente lite order is intended to go no further than provide subsistence and counsel fees pending the litigation. It cannot set up a savings account in favor of the plaintiff. Sguros v. Sguros, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 408</cite>,

                            Order Does Not Determine Final or Ultimate Rights of the Parties. - Order granting or denying subsistence pendente lite, with or without counsel fees, whether or not containing findings of fact, is not a final determination of and does not affect the
                            final rights of the parties. Schloss v. Schloss, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 266</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 5 (1968).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the facts are investigated and findings are made as a guide to the court in making temporary allowances, they do not affect the ultimate rights of the parties at the final hearing. Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 121</cite>,

                            The final merits of the action are not before the trial judge upon a pendente lite hearing. Therefore, upon a pendente lite hearing, the trial judge may not determine the ultimate property rights of the parties. Black v. Black,
                            <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 226 S.E.2d 858, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 775</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 31 (1976).

                            Determination of rights to a joint savings account is a matter for final hearing on all the merits, and not for hearing on alimony pendente lite. Roberts v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 226 S.E.2d

                            No Present Right to Disbursement of Eminent Domain Deposit for Land Owned by Entirety. - A wife separated from her husband and seeking alimony pendente lite had no present right to disbursement of money deposited by the State Highway Commission (now Board
                            of Transportation) as a credit against just compensation for land owned by the wife and her husband as tenants by entirety. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Myers, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 258</cite>,

                            It was error to order defendant to pay monthly premiums on two life insurance policies in which the child was named as primary beneficiary, because such payments provided nothing to meet the immediate needs of the child pending hearing of the case on
                            its merits. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 180 S.E.2d 374 (1971).

                            Allowance for Children. - Where in passing upon a motion of plaintiff in her action for divorce a mensa for alimony, etc., pendente lite, if the trial judge has found facts sufficient upon the evidence, he may award the custody of the minor children,
                            who have been removed by the defendant from the State, to the plaintiff, with an additional allowance for them from the time they may be placed in her custody. Jones v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 279</cite>,

                            Effect of Reconciliation and Resumption of Marital Relations. - Where an order for alimony pendente lite has been rendered, but subsequent thereto there is a reconciliation and a resumption of marital relations in the home, the necessity for alimony ceases,
                            and a judge has no power to reactivate the order for alimony pendente lite. However, the original cause is still pending and upon a subsequent separation and need for subsistence for the wife, the courts are open for whatever
                            relief may be justified by the situation then existing. Hester v. Hester, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 97</cite>, 79 S.E.2d 248 (1953).

                            Prerequisites for Obtaining Alimony Pendente Lite. - In order to obtain alimony pendente lite, the applicant must be (1) a dependent spouse, (2) entitled to the relief demanded in the action, and (3) without sufficient means whereon to subsist during
                            the prosecution or defense of the suit and to defray the necessary expenses thereof. Hogue v. Hogue, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C.

                            This section establishes the requirements for an award of alimony pendente lite. In the first place, the applicant must be a dependent spouse. Once it is established that the applicant is a dependent spouse it must appear that such spouse: (1) Prima facie,
                            is entitled to the relief demanded in the action, i.e., absolute divorce, divorce from bed and board, annulment, or alimony without divorce; and (2) Does not have sufficient means whereon to subsist during the prosecution or
                            defense of the suit and to defray the necessary expenses thereof. Cabe v. Cabe, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 201 S.E.2d 203 (1973).

                        <p>
                            To obtain alimony pendente lite, the dependent spouse must show, among other things, that he or she is entitled to the relief demanded by such spouse in the action in which the application for alimony pendente lite is made, and that he or she has not
                            sufficient means whereon to subsist during the prosecution or defense of the suit and to defray the necessary expenses thereof. Fore v. Fore, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 226, 189 S.E.2d

                            In order for a spouse to be entitled to alimony pendente lite under this section, the trial court must make findings of fact to show three requirements: (1) the existence of a marital relationship; (2) that the spouse is either (a) actually or substantially
                            dependent upon the other spouse for maintenance and support, or (b) is substantially in need of maintenance and support from the other spouse; and (3) that the supporting spouse is capable of making the required payments. Hampton

                            of an award of counsel fees the following: (1) The spouse is entitled to the relief demanded; (2) The spouse is a dependent spouse; and (3) The dependent spouse has not sufficient means whereon to subsist during the prosecution

                            Income of Dependent Spouse Must Be Insufficient for Support and Expenses of Suit. - A married woman (dependent spouse) is entitled to alimony pendente lite from husband's (supporting spouse's) estate when the income from her separate estate is not sufficient
                            for her support and to defray the necessary expenses in prosecuting her suit. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 70</cite> (1876).

                            Spouse with Ample Means Is Not Entitled to Allowance. - The right of alimony pendente lite is predicated upon the justice of affording the wife (dependent spouse) sufficient means to cope with her husband (supporting spouse) in presenting their case before
                            the court, and a finding, supported by evidence, that wife has earnings and means of support equal to that of her husband sustains the court's order denying her motion for alimony pendente lite. Oliver v. Oliver,
                            <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 299</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 549 (1941).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where wife (spouse) has a monthly income substantially larger than her husband's (spouse's), the requirements of subsection (a)(2) of this section are not made to appear, and it is error to award alimony pendente lite and counsel fees pendente lite. Davis
                            v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 180 S.E.2d 374 (1971).

                        <p>
                            But mere fact that wife (dependent spouse) has property or means of her own does not prohibit an award of alimony pendente lite. Strother v. Strother, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 223 S.E.2d 838 (1976); Robbins
                            v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 259 S.E.2d 353 (1979).

                        <p>
                            Nor Relieve Supporting Spouse of Duty. - The fact that the wife has separate property of her own does not relieve the husband of his duty to maintain for his wife the standard of living to which she has become accustomed. Gardner v. Gardner,

                        <p>
                            The clear and unambiguous language of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.4" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.4</a></cite> require that to receive attorneys' fees in an alimony case it must be determined that
                            (1) the spouse is entitled to the relief demanded; (2) the spouse is a dependent spouse; and (3) the dependent spouse has not sufficient means whereon to subsist during the prosecution of the suit and to defray the necessary
                            expenses thereof. All three of these determinations must be made in order to support an award of attorneys' fees. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 265 S.E.2d 626 (1980).

                        <p>
                            No Allowance Where Dependent Spouse Has No Case. - Discretion in allowance of support to a wife (dependent spouse), while suing her husband (supporting spouse) is confined to consideration of necessities of the wife on the one hand and the means of the
                            husband on the other, but to warrant such allowance the court is expected to look into the merits of the action and would not be justified in allowing subsistence and counsel fees where the plaintiff, in law, has no case. Garner

                            Court Must Look to Merits to Determine If Case for Relief Has Been Made. - In order to warrant the allowance of alimony pendente lite, the court must look to the merits of the action to determine if the petitioning party in law has made out a case entitling
                            her to the relief demanded. Therrell v. Therrell, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 321, 198 S.E.2d 776 (1973).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In passing on a motion for alimony pendente lite the judge is expected to look into the merits of the action and determine in his sound legal discretion, after considering the allegations of the complaint and the evidence of the respective parties, whether
                            or not the movant is entitled to the relief sought. Parker v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 176</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 174 (1964).

                            Complaint Must Allege Facts Constituting Cause of Action. - Alimony pendente lite and counsel fees should not be awarded unless the plaintiff alleges in her complaint facts sufficient to constitute a good cause of action. Ipock v. Ipock,
                            <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 387</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 283 (1951).

                            But Kind of Divorce Warranted by Petition Is Immaterial. - Upon an application for alimony pendente lite, it is unnecessary to decide whether the petition warrants a divorce a vinculo or only a divorce a mensa et thoro. Little v. Little,

                            Burden upon Dependent Spouse. - Upon the application of a dependent spouse for alimony pendente lite, the burden is upon her to establish (1) that she is entitled to relief in her action and, (2) that she does not have sufficient means whereon to subsist
                            during the prosecution of her claim or to defray the necessary expenses thereof. In re Mason, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 185 S.E.2d 433 (1971), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 495</cite>,

                            Mere Institution of Suit Is Not Enough. - A wife (dependent spouse) is not entitled to an order for support pendente lite merely because she has instituted an action and alleged grounds for divorce or alimony. Deal v. Deal,

                            In a wife's (dependent spouse's) action for an allowance pendente lite the husband (supporting spouse) is not precluded from asserting and proving as a defense to his wife's action and motion that she has separated herself from him or abandoned him. Deal

                            Separation by Mutual Agreement. - The court properly denied a wife's motion for an interim award of alimony pendente lite and counsel fees in her suit for alimony without divorce, where there were findings that (1) the plaintiff and her husband had separated
                            by mutual agreement, (2) the husband did not abandon the wife, and (3) the husband was guilty of no misconduct that would support an award of alimony. Harper v. Harper, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite>                            341, 176 S.E.2d 48 (1970).

                            Where in proceedings by wife to secure her subsistence and reasonable counsel fees under this section it was alleged that a separation agreement was procured by fraud, sufficiently pleaded, objection that the validity of the separation contract had to
                            be determined first in an independent action was untenable, as former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite> expressly provided that alimony could be granted
                            "pending the trial and final determination of the issues." Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 197</cite>, 148 S.E. 171 (1929).

                            relating to actions for alimony without divorce, were equally applicable to a motion for temporary alimony under former G.S. 50-15, pending the trial of an action for divorce from bed and board. Williams v. Williams,

                            Validity of Marriage. - Under Session Laws 1919, c. 24, it was not required that an issue involving the validity of the marriage be first determined before wife could sustain her civil action against her husband for an allowance for reasonable subsistence
                            and counsel fees pending trial and final determination of the issue relating to the validity of the marriage. Barbee v. Barbee, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 538</cite>, 122 S.E. 177 (1924).

                            Pleadings Held Insufficient. - Trial court did not err by finding wife's pleadings were insufficient on their face and dismissing her action for alimony and alimony pendente lite; plaintiff asserted in her complaint that she was a "dependent spouse,"
                            but the only support she offered for this conclusion was evidence of her husband's salary and she did not present any evidence that she needed assistance to subsist during the prosecution or defense of the suit. Shook v. Shook,

                            Order for Temporary Alimony Held Error. - Trial court erred in ordering husband to pay wife temporary alimony and counsel fees retroactively from Dec. 21, 1987, the date of the entry of the order, to Aug. 1, 1984, approximately one month after the date
                            the parties separated; wife's failure to claim alimony pendente lite and counsel fees at the time the parties separated demonstrated a total lack of need for an order of temporary alimony and counsel fees and the record vividly
                            disclosed that wife was able to support herself and employ counsel to protect her interest during the pendency of the action. Haywood v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 382

                            Award Upheld. - In an action by a wife for a divorce a mensa, where acts of cruelty were alleged as the ground of separation, and an estimate was made of the value of the defendant's estate, it was held that there was sufficient evidence to decree alimony
                            and fix the amount. Pain v. Pain, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 322</cite> (1879).

                        <p>
                            Allegations were held sufficient where acts were alleged which were well calculated to make wife's condition intolerable and her life burdensome and the bill set forth an estimate of the amount of the defendant's property. Gaylord v. Gaylord,

                            Where the complaint of wife seeking a divorce alleged facts which, if believed, entitled her to the relief demanded, and it was supplemented by an affidavit that the husband was trying to dispose of his property and had offered his land for sale with
                            the avowed purpose of leaving the State, and that the children were small and needed the mother's care, it was proper to grant an order for alimony pendente lite, and it was also competent for the court to award to the mother
                            the custody of the younger children. Scroggins v. Scroggins, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 319</cite> (1879).

                            Where the allegations in the complaint were not controverted, it was sufficient if the judge found that no answer was filed and adjudged alimony to be paid. Zimmerman v. Zimmerman, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 432</cite>,

                            Where, in husband's action for divorce on ground of adultery, wife filed an answer denying the charges and set up a cross-action for divorce from bed and board, the finding by the court that the wife denied the charge of adultery under oath, that the
                            court did not find that she was guilty of adultery, that the husband had abandoned her and that she was financially unable to defray the necessary and proper expenses of the action and was without means of support, and that
                            the husband was financially able to make the payments ordered, was sufficient to support the court's order of alimony pendente lite. Covington v. Covington, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 569</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Plaintiff was entitled to an order for subsistence pendente lite where the facts found by the judge showed that the defendant abandoned his wife, without any fault or provocation on her part, and without providing for her any maintenance and support.

                            Award Held Improper. - Where the finding that plaintiff wife was a "dependent spouse" amounted to a mere conclusion unsupported by a finding of fact, and where there were no findings upon which to conclude that wife was entitled to the relief demanded
                            under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the trial court erred in ordering alimony pendente lite and counsel fees. Kornegay v. Kornegay, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 751, 190 S.E.2d

                            The amount of the allowance to plaintiff for subsistence pendente lite and counsel fees is a matter for the trial judge. He has full power to act without the intervention of the jury, and his discretion in this respect is not reviewable, except in case
                            of an abuse of discretion. Fogartie v. Fogartie, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 188</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 226 (1952); Rowland v. Rowland, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 328</cite>, 116 S.E.2d 795 (1960);

                            Where attorneys' fees may be properly awarded, the amount of the award rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge and is reviewable on appeal only for abuse of discretion. Hudson v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 465</cite>,

                            But This Discretion Is Not Absolute and Unreviewable. - The allowance of support and counsel fees pendente lite in a suit for divorce or alimony without divorce is not an absolute discretion to be exercised at the pleasure of the court and unreviewable,
                            but is to be exercised within certain limits and with respect to factual conditions. Butler v. Butler, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 594</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 745 (1946); Garner v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 293</cite>,

                            Discretion in making allowances pendente lite is confined to consideration of the necessities of the wife on the one hand, and the means of the husband on the other. Brady v. Brady, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 299</cite>,

                            Mixed Questions of Law and Fact. - Determination of what constitutes a "dependent spouse" and what constitutes a "supporting spouse" requires an application of principles of statutory law to facts and therefore involves mixed questions of law and fact.
                            Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971).

                            Trial Judge Must Look into the Merits. - In considering a motion for alimony pendente lite, the court may not exercise an absolute and unreviewable discretion based solely upon the allegations of the complaint and the plaintiff's evidence offered in support
                            thereof, while refusing to hear the evidence of the defendant. The judge is expected to look into the merits of the action and determine, in his sound legal discretion, after considering the allegations of the complaint and
                            the evidence of the respective parties, whether or not the movant is entitled to the relief sought. Ipock v. Ipock, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 387</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 283 (1951); Parker v. Parker,

                        <p>
                            And Consider a Number of Factors. - While the amount of alimony pendente lite to be awarded rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge, the judge must take into consideration a number of factors, including the accustomed standard of living of
                            the parties and the estate of earnings of each party. Cornelison v. Cornelison, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 91, 266 S.E.2d 707 (1980).

                            And the Court Must Make Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Thereon. - In suits for alimony pendente lite, the grounds listed under this section are conclusions of law necessary to justify an order granting such alimony. The court, therefore, must
                            conclude as a matter of law that the party seeking alimony pendente lite (1) is the dependent spouse, (2) is a party in an action for absolute divorce, divorce from bed and board, annulment, or alimony without divorce and,
                            (3) from all the evidence presented pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.8ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.8(f)</a></cite>, (a) is entitled to the relief demanded in the action, and
                            (b) is shown to lack sufficient means whereon to subsist during the prosecution or defense of the suit. Specific facts which support such a conclusion must be found. Steele v. Steele, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                            601, 244 S.E.2d 466 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This section requires the trial judge to conclude as a matter of law that the spouse seeking alimony pendente lite is the dependent spouse within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1(3)</a></cite>;
                            that such spouse is a party in an action for absolute divorce, divorce from bed and board, annulment, or alimony without divorce; that such spouse is entitled to the relief demanded; and that such spouse is shown to lack sufficient
                            means whereon to subsist during the course of the litigation. Cornelison v. Cornelison, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 91, 266 S.E.2d 707 (1980).

                        <p>
                            It is necessary for the trial judge to make findings from which it can be determined, upon appellate review, that an award of alimony pendente lite is justified and appropriate in the case. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971); Travis v. Travis, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C.

                            Evidentiary or Subsidiary Facts Need Not Be Found. - In an action for alimony pendente lite the trial court is not required to find evidentiary or subsidiary facts. The court need only find the ultimate facts in issue. Orren v. Orren,
                            <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 212 S.E.2d 394 (1975).

                            But Findings of Ultimate Facts Must Be Made. - In making findings of fact under subsection (f) of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.8" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.8</a></cite> it is not necessary that the trial judge
                            make detailed findings as to each allegation and evidentiary fact presented. It is necessary that he find the ultimate facts sufficient to establish that the dependent spouse is entitled to an award of alimony pendente lite
                            under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. Blake v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 410, 170 S.E.2d 87 (1969); Robbins v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 259 S.E.2d 353 (1979).

                            Dependency Must Be Found. - Absent a finding of fact in the order of alimony pendente lite that the plaintiff was a dependent spouse, alimony pendente lite may not be awarded. Musten v. Musten, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                            618, 244 S.E.2d 699 (1978).

                            As Must Financial Need. - While it is not necessary in awarding alimony pendente lite on the basis of dependency for the trial judge to find that the wife (dependent spouse) would be unable to exist without support, it is necessary that the trial judge
                            find facts which establish that she is substantially in need of maintenance and support. Newsome v. Newsome, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 207 S.E.2d 355 (1974).

                            In order to recover counsel fees, this section requires a finding that plaintiff is unable to defray the expense of prosecuting the suit. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 302 S.E.2d 886 (1983).

                            Lack of Findings as to Dependent Spouse's Means Is Reversible Error. - Failure to make specific findings as to the sufficiency of dependent spouse's means of subsistence during the prosecution of her action and of defraying the necessary expenses thereof
                            constitutes reversible error. Mitchell v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 54, 182 S.E.2d 627 (1971).

                            Where the order appealed from is deficient in findings to establish that plaintiff is entitled to alimony pendente lite pursuant to this section, the award of counsel fees under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.4" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.4</a></cite>                            is also unsupported and must be reversed.

                            When Award Will Be Based on Capacity to Earn. - To base an award on capacity to earn rather than actual earnings, there should be a finding based on evidence that the husband (supporting spouse) was failing to exercise his capacity to earn because of
                            a disregard of his marital obligation to provide reasonable support for his wife (dependent spouse). Conrad v. Conrad, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 412</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 912 (1960); Robinson v.
                            Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 463, 179 S.E.2d 144 (1971).

                            An award of alimony pendente lite may not be based on the earning capacity of the supporting spouse in the absence of a finding that the defendant is failing to exercise his capacity to earn because of a disregard of his marital obligation to provide
                            reasonable support. Gobble v. Gobble, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 765, 242 S.E.2d 516 (1978).

                            Allowance When Supporting Spouse Denies Having Property. - Where the husband (supporting spouse) denies having any property, but admits that he is an able-bodied man, the court may order an allowance without inquiry into the value of his property. Muse

                            Allowance of Reasonable Amount. - In an action for alimony without divorce, upon issuance of summons and the filing of a verified complaint setting forth facts sufficient to entitle the complainant to the relief sought, the judge has power to require
                            the payment by the husband of a reasonable amount for the wife's subsistence and counsel fees pendente lite. Perkins v. Perkins, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 91</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 356 (1950).

                            Appeal as a Matter of Right. - An order requiring payment of alimony pendente lite and counsel fees affects a substantial right from which an appeal lies as a matter of right.

                            Reviewable Question of Law in Award of Attorneys' Fees. - The facts required by this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.4" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.4</a></cite> must be alleged and proved to support an order
                            for attorneys' fees. Whether these requirements have been met is a question of law that is reviewable on appeal. Hudson v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 465</cite>, 263 S.E.2d 719 (1980).

                            Denial of Attorneys' Fees Held Interlocutory. - Denial of attorneys' fees under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.4" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.4</a></cite> was not a final order of the trial court, where at the time
                            appellant's motion was filed there had been no determination that his client, defendant, was entitled to alimony pendente lite under this section, so that appellant was not yet entitled to attorneys' fees under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.4" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.4</a></cite>,
                            and as appellant could appeal the denial of his motion after final judgment, or could bring a separate lawsuit to collect his fees, no substantial right of appellant was affected by the Court of Appeals' failure to entertain
                            an interlocutory appeal on this issue. Howell v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 365 S.E.2d 181 (1988).

                            Weight of Evidence is for Trier of Facts. - While the sufficiency of the findings of fact to support the award is reviewable on appeal, the weight to be accorded the evidence is solely for the trier of the facts. Cornelison v. Cornelison,
                            <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 91, 266 S.E.2d 707 (1980).

                            Effect of Appeal. - When an order arising from a domestic case is appealed, the cause is taken out of the jurisdiction of the trial court and put into the jurisdiction of the appellate court. Pending the appeal, the trial judge is functus officio and
                            is without authority to act in the matter. Traywick v. Traywick, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 363, 229 S.E.2d 220 (1976).

                            Remand on Appeal. - The district court had jurisdiction to entertain a motion in the cause and to adjudge defendant guilty of contempt for failure to comply with order for alimony pendente lite after the judgment on the merits had been reversed on other

                        Entitlement. - In an action brought pursuant to Chapter 50 of the General Statutes, either party may move for alimony. The court shall award alimony to the dependent spouse upon a finding that one spouse is a dependent spouse, that the other spouse is
                        a supporting spouse, and that an award of alimony is equitable after considering all relevant factors, including those set out in subsection (b) of this section. If the court finds that the dependent spouse participated in an act
                        of illicit sexual behavior, as defined in G.S. 50-16.1A(3)a., during the marriage and prior to or on the date of separation, the court shall not award alimony. If the court finds that the supporting spouse participated in an act
                        of illicit sexual behavior, as defined in G.S. 50-16.1A(3)a., during the marriage and prior to or on the date of separation, then the court shall order that alimony be paid to a dependent spouse. If the court finds that the dependent
                        and the supporting spouse each participated in an act of illicit sexual behavior during the marriage and prior to or on the date of separation, then alimony shall be denied or awarded in the discretion of the court after consideration
                        of all of the circumstances. Any act of illicit sexual behavior by either party that has been condoned by the other party shall not be considered by the court.

                    The claim for alimony may be heard on the merits prior to the entry of a judgment for equitable distribution, and if awarded, the issues of amount and of whether a spouse is a dependent or supporting spouse may be reviewed by the court after the conclusion
                    of the equitable distribution claim.

                        Pleadings. - Trial court erred in granting a wife's motion to dismiss a husband's alimony claim on the grounds that he failed to reply to the wife's counterclaims because the allegations set forth in the wife's counterclaims, and reiterated in a finding
                        of fact in the trial court's order, were merely denials in affirmative form of the allegations of the complaint, and the trial court erred in deeming admitted the allegations in the wife's counterclaim that the husband was not
                        a dependent spouse and that he was not a supporting spouse; a plaintiff is not required to re-allege those allegations in a complaint that have been "denied in the affirmative" by way of a counterclaim by a defendant. Crowley v.
                        Crowley, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 691 S.E.2d 727 (2010), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 324</cite>, 700 S.E.2d 749, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 591 (2010).

                    <p>
                        Because there was no counterclaim for alimony in a wife's answer to a husband's complaint, but there were three specific counterclaims that incorporated by reference and re-alleged those portions of the answer that related to alimony, the wife did assert
                        counterclaims to which a reply would generally be required; however, a plaintiff's failure to file a reply re-asserting allegations already made in the complaint in response to averments in a defendant's counterclaim, which do
                        no more than present denials in affirmative form of the allegations of the complaint, does not amount to an admission pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,

                        "Dependent Spouse." - Trial court did not err by determining a wife was not a "dependent spouse" for purposes of alimony, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1</a></cite>A(2) and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a),
                        because there was a surplus left to the wife each month, after deducting all of the wife's expenses from her net monthly income; the wife's "change in lifestyles" argument in support of alimony was rejected because the wife's previous
                        standard of living was "artificially inflated" by a massive infusion of debt. Bodie v. Bodie, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 727 S.E.2d 11 (2012).

                        "New Action" Under Rule 41(a)(1). - An alimony claim made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and filed within one year of plaintiff's dismissal of her first claim (under repealed <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.6ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.6(a)</a></cite>)
                        failed to qualify as "a new action based on the same claim" under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 41(a)(1), because the claim for alimony under this section
                        was distinct from that set out by the repealed section in that it deferred to the court's discretion the decision of whether to award alimony where both the supporting and dependent spouse "each participated in an act of illicit
                        sexual behavior," whereas the old section foreclosed a dependent spouse from recovering. Brannock v. Brannock, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 635, 523 S.E.2d 110 (1999).

                        Amounts Paid Into Investments May Be Classified as Expenses. - The trial court did not abuse its discretion by characterizing the funds reflecting a marital pattern of savings as a reasonable expense where defendant was still employed and had a comfortable
                        and significantly higher income than plaintiff, who was not working, but the trial court's inclusion of this investment income amount as an expense for the plaintiff but not for the defendant did constitute an abuse of discretion.

                        It was error to award, as a component of alimony, a sum to enable a wife to accumulate savings because (1) this was not the purpose of alimony, and (2) a sum the parties contributed to savings on a monthly basis during the marriage was not found, and
                        (3) the court did not factor in the savings as a monthly expense of the wife in calculating the wife's reasonable monthly expenses. Collins v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 696, 778

        Accustomed Standard of Living.
       </b> - Certainly, there is no requirement that one spouse enjoy the same lifestyle as the other spouse's current lifestyle, but the trial court must consider the accustomed standard of living developed during the marriage
                        in determining one spouse's reasonable need for support. Myers v. Myers, - N.C. App. - , 837 S.E.2d 443 (2020).

                        Findings of Fact. - The findings of fact required to support the amount, duration, and manner of payment of an alimony award are sufficient if findings of fact have been made on the ultimate facts at issue in the case and the findings of fact show the
                        trial court properly applied the law in the case; however, the findings of fact need not set forth the weight given to the factors in subsection (b) by the trial court when determining the appropriate amount, duration, and manner
                        of payment, as the weight given the factors is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Friend-Novorska v. Novorska, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 545 S.E.2d 788 (2001), aff'd,

                        Remand was required where a trial court, while making sufficient ultimate findings of fact to support an award of permanent alimony, failed to state findings of fact as to the reasoning for the duration of the award and the manner of payment. Fitzgerald
                        v. Fitzgerald, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 414, 588 S.E.2d 517 (2003).

                    <p>
                        While the trial court's findings were sufficiently specific to indicate that the trial judge properly considered each of the statutory factors, the alimony award was improper because the trial court made no findings with respect to the wife's medical
                        benefits or potential income from her IRA, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(b)(4) although evidence of the sources of income was presented
                        at the hearing; without such findings, it was not known where the trial court properly considered the factor. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 238, 647 S.E.2d 481 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 171</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Trial court's findings of fact were more than sufficient to demonstrate the court's consideration of the statutory factors under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A because the court
                        considered: (1) the duration of the parties' marriage; (2) the status of the parties' minor children; (3) the parties' ages and education levels; (4) the parties' relative incomes and earning capacities; (5) the parties' expenses,
                        debts, and financial obligations; (6) the parties' standard of living; and (7) the marital misconduct of one of the parties. Hartsell v. Hartsell, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 65, 657 S.E.2d 724 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Because the trial court failed to make factual findings as to the parties' financial needs, accustomed standard of living, separate and marital debt obligations, and the expenses reasonably necessary to support each of them, its post-separation support
                        and alimony awards to the husband under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a), (b), and (c) were reversed. Crocker v. Crocker, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite>                        165, 660 S.E.2d 212 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Sufficient findings supported a trial court's award of retroactive alimony to a former wife because the court's findings regarding the amount, duration, and manner of payment were set out in its February 2012 order, while an April 2012 order simply awarded
                        the wife alimony for a time period that was inadvertently omitted from the February order, and reading the two orders together supported the entirety of the award; the statute authorized the trial court to award retroactive alimony.
                        Smallwood v. Smallwood, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 742 S.E.2d 814 (2013).

                    <p>
                        In its order awarding alimony, the trial court made findings of fact addressing all 16 statutory factors before concluding that the wife was entitled to an award of alimony lasting for two years; the trial court stated that it considered the wife's affair
                        and resulting disrespect for and mistreatment of the marriage in reaching its alimony decision, and this finding was sufficient to explain the trial court's reasoning in awarding alimony for only two years, plus the trial court
                        made other findings that could also support its decision, which was affirmed. Ellis v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 767 S.E.2d 413 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Alimony award erred because the trial court's findings of fact were limited to the parties' incomes and expenses in various prior years, instead of considering all competent evidence of all statutory factors. Collins v. Collins,
                        <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 696, 778 S.E.2d 854 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court acted within its discretion in calculating a husband's total reasonable needs and expenses based on the record evidence because its specific findings as to the total expenses were attached and incorporated by reference as an exhibit, which
                        detailed and confirmed the total expenses. Burger v. Burger, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 790 S.E.2d 683 (2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reversal and remand of a trial court's order was appropriate because the court had to enter additional findings concerning the parties' expenses as the court's alimony order did not include any findings as to the wife's expenses. Kabasan v. Kabasan,
                        <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 436, 810 S.E.2d 691 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Finding of fact was simply a comparison of the relative assets and liabilities of the spouses as required the statute, and as there was competent evidence to support the finding, the husband's challenge was overruled. Rea v. Rea,
                        <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 822 S.E.2d 426 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Due to the incomplete transcript, the court of appeals could review the sufficiency of the evidence, because the order on appeal had findings of fact on some of the alimony factors, the court of appeals assumed they were supported by the evidence; since
                        findings for a particular factor were only required if evidence was presented on that factor, the court of appeals also had to assume the trial court made findings addressing all of the factors for which evidence was presented.

                    <p>

                        Trial court had to revisit its calculations of gross income and net income used to determine child support and alimony because it had to make additional findings to support its determination of a husband's business income, which was used to calculate
                        gross income and determine child support; the trial court also had to make additional findings to account for the husband's mandatory retirement deduction and his reasonable health insurance expenses in the calculation of his net
                        income. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826 S.E.2d 788 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Findings of fact were sufficient to meet statutory requirements; the trial court found defendant was not dependent on plaintiff for maintenance as she had substantial unearned income in the form of the life insurance proceeds, and the trial court relied
                        on the same findings the court used to distribute property as the court required consideration of similar factors. The trial court did not simply disqualify defendant from receiving alimony based solely on her ability to support
                        herself through estate depletion. Crago v. Crago, - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 700 (2019), review denied, 838 S.E.2d 181, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 166.

                        It was unclear how the trial court reached the court's amount of prospective alimony, and even based on the trial court's findings, it appeared the wife had greater reasonable needs than $ 1,200.00 per month and the husband had the ability to pay substantially
                        more; the only issue was the wife's reasonable needs based upon the accustomed standard of living established during the marriage, and the order of prospective alimony was vacated and remanded for additional findings. Myers v.

                        Actual findings by the trial court were insufficiently detailed or specific where, other than the parties' contributions to retirement and stock, the trial court made no findings regarding the parties' standard of living during the marriage and the parties'
                        respective living expenses since the separation. Rhew v. Rhew, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 531 S.E.2d 471 (2000).

                        Trial Court Must Determine Equitable Distribution Prior to Determining Alimony. - Since the trial court heard both the alimony claim and the equitable distribution claims simultaneously, it had to determine the final equitable distribution prior to determining
                        alimony; on remand, the trial court had to first determine the equitable distribution matters prior to considering the alimony issues since the distribution could potentially change the financial circumstances of the parties including
                        the need for or ability to pay alimony. Carpenter v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 781 S.E.2d 828 (2016).

                        Calculating Income. - There was no evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the husband would pick up additional business to offset established income losses of some $80,000 per year; thus, the court incorrectly determined the husband's income
                        for alimony purposes. Glass v. Glass, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 784, 509 S.E.2d 236 (1998).

                        Trial court erred in its calculation of a wife's income because it calculated her average net income even though there was no evidence in the record to suggest that she was depressing her income; if the trial court imputed income to the wife on the basis
                        of earning capacity, its calculation of her income would constitute error, and if it included post-separation support (PSS) the wife received from the husband, that would also constitute error, because (PSS) was not permanent income.

                        Trial court properly determined a wife's income in accordance with the record evidence because the wife had consistently received bonuses for the past four years; the wife based her most recent financial affidavit in part on her gross monthly income,
                        but she admitted that her bonus for that year totaled around $ 41,000. Burger v. Burger, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 790 S.E.2d 683 (2016).

                        Husband's ability to pay alimony was not sufficiently found because, rather than finding the husband's current income, the court based an alimony award on an average of the husband's income in two prior years. Green v. Green,

                        Because personal expenses were included as business deductions and accounted for in the business tax returns used to determine a husband's income from a business, the trial court did not err in excluding them from the living expenses; including the personal
                        expenses as separate living expenses after they were considered in determining income from the business would result in "double dipping." Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826

                        Trial court abused its discretion in failing to factor a husband's law enforcement officer (LEO) retirement into net income calculations and in believing it was voluntary because the LEO was a mandatory deduction from the husband's income, making that
                        portion of his income unavailable to him to pay towards alimony; the trial court should have accounted for the mandatory deduction it its calculation of the husband's net income. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite>                        735, 826 S.E.2d 788 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Because a deduction for a husband's law enforcement officer retirement was mandatory, and those funds were not available to the husband to pay alimony, the trial court's failure to account for the mandatory deduction was not supported by reason and amounted
                        to an abuse of discretion; at the very least, the trial court had to make further findings setting forth the reasons why the retirement was not factored into its calculations. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite>                        735, 826 S.E.2d 788 (2019).

                        Trial court's findings supported its decision to use prior years' income from a business in the calculation of gross income for the determinations of alimony and child support because the trial court questioned whether the husband's reported income accurately
                        represented his income from the business; the trial court found that the husband's reported income was not credible. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826 S.E.2d 788 (2019).

                        Trial court did not err in its award of alimony because its findings regarding the parties' income and expenses were supported by competent evidence; the trial court did not err in imputing minimum wage income to the husband, who had no eyesight in one

                        Findings as to Duration of Alimony Award. - Where an action was filed on 16 July 1993, pre-dating this section, and where the prior applicable version of the alimony provisions contained no requirement that there be findings relative to the duration of
                        any alimony award, the trial court did not err in mandating a lifetime award and making no other findings relative to the duration of the award. Bookholt v. Bookholt, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite>                        247, 523 S.E.2d 729 (1999).

                        Findings on Marital Misconduct. - The trial court properly considered postseparation expenditures by the wife for clothing totalling $23,520, but such evidence did not require a finding of marital misconduct by the wife, where the court found that both
                        parties spent excessively. Glass v. Glass, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 784, 509 S.E.2d 236 (1998).

                        The trial court was required to make specific findings as to the existence of marital misconduct, where the wife presented evidence that the husband communicated with other women during the marriage, met with one of them in an apartment, and hugged and

                        Trial judge held that plaintiff wife's conduct constituted marital misconduct without just cause or excuse, and that the wife caused defendant husband to suffer indignities so that an award of alimony would not be equitable pursuant to
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A. The judgment was reversed and remanded where the appellate court found the trial court simply adopted the husband's testimony without making

                        Statute clearly bars alimony for a dependent spouse who has engaged in uncondoned marital misconduct, and the wife's contention that the trial court could not consider her marital misconduct in determining her award of alimony because the husband condoned
                        the misconduct and sought to salvage his marriage was rejected; there is nothing in the statute to indicate that the trial court cannot consider a spouse's condoned marital misconduct in calculating its award of alimony to the
                        dependent spouse, as the trial court can consider acts of condoned marital misconduct as part of its determination of an award of alimony. Ellis v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 239,

                        Although the husband's overnight stays with another woman at the hotel were shortly after the parties separated, under the statute, nothing prevented a court from considering incidents of post date-of-separation marital misconduct as corroborating evidence
                        supporting other evidence that marital misconduct occurred during the marriage; therefore, there was competent evidence to support the finding of fact in this regard. Rea v. Rea, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite>                        421, 822 S.E.2d 426 (2018).

                        Alimony award had to be remanded because the award was based on a wife's income five to seven years before the order was entered, so insufficient facts regarding whether the wife lacked sufficient actual and current income to maintain the wife's standard
                        of living established during the marriage supported a conclusion that the wife was a dependent spouse. Collins v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 696, 778 S.E.2d 854 (2015).

                        Failure to State Grounds in Pleading. - Wife did not sufficiently plead her claim for alimony when her counterclaim for this relief only requested a certain monthly amount of alimony because she did not specify the grounds upon which she based her alimony
                        claim, so her husband was not put on notice of such grounds and could not defend against them, as required by G.S.1A-1-8(a)(1). Coleman v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 641 S.E.2d

                        Date of Separation. - Trial court did not err in finding a husband and wife were not separated at the time of the wife's marital misconduct, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1</a></cite>A(3)(a),
                        thereby precluding an award of alimony to the wife under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a), because even though there was some physical separation of the parties after a choking
                        incident involving the parties' son, neither party expressed to the other they wanted to separate and the husband continued to maintain all of his belongings at the marital residence; although the phrase "the date of separation"
                        as used in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a) was not defined, the phrase "separate and apart" as used in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-6" target="_self">G.S. 50-6</a></cite>                        meant there had to be a physical separation and an intention on the part of at least one of the parties to cease matrimonial cohabitation.

                        Cohabitation Defense. - Trial court, which awarded defendant alimony, acted under a misapprehension of the law when it rejected plaintiff's request to assert a cohabitation defense. Because the trial court acted under a misapprehension of the law, its
                        alimony order was subject to vacation. Orren v. Orren, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 480, 800 S.E.2d 472 (2017).

                        Summary judgment was appropriate where a premarital agreement signed by the parties irrefutably barred the wife's claims for postseparation support, alimony and equitable distribution; the language in the subject agreement - drafted by the wife's attorney
                        - was sufficiently "express" to constitute a valid and enforceable waiver of the wife's claims for postseparation support pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.2" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.2</a></cite>A

                        Standard of Living of the Spouses Established During the Marriage. - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.5" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.5</a></cite> clearly stated that the trial court is to consider the parties' "accustomed
                        standard of living," not the potential standard of living; therefore, a trial court properly concluded that divorcing parties' standard of living did not substantially increase when the husband became a partner in his accounting
                        firm, resulting in a net increase in salary of approximately $240.00 a month, a change from $6,487.52 to $6,732.73. (Decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.5" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.5</a></cite>.) Kelly

                        Raised Standard of Living. - Because it was unclear what amount each child used for his or her own needs, and what amount was used to supplement plaintiff's needs, which also hinged on a determination of the change in standard of living, the matter was
                        remanded for the court to determine if the dependent spouse had raised her standard of living, and whether the contributions by the adult children should be a means of supporting that increase. Dodson v. Dodson,

                        Reasonable Expenses. - Husband and eife established a lifestyle of caring for foster children; this economic choice was certainly worth at least the same consideration as golf and vacations, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by including
                        these expenses in the wife's needs. Rea v. Rea, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 822 S.E.2d 426 (2018).

                        her affidavit demonstrating that her total reasonable monthly expenses had increased 24 percent since the prior order, to $7,474 per month, was itself sufficient evidence of the change in circumstances, without requiring additional
                        supporting evidence. Parsons v. Parsons, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 752 S.E.2d 530 (2013).

                        Relative Financial Need And Reasonable Expenses. - Trial court must consider the relative needs of the spouses, and the term "relative" is an adjective describing needs of the spouses; the term "relative" is used simply to direct a comparison of the expenses
                        of the husband and the wife, and the court saw no reason the "relative financial need" of the wife had to differ from her "reasonable expenses." The trial court's calculation of the wife's need for alimony was clear. Rea v. Rea,
                        <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 822 S.E.2d 426 (2018).

                        Alimony Award Upheld. - An alimony award to the plaintiff wife of $600 per month for 30 months was upheld where (1) the wife received an unequal distribution of the marital property in her favor; (2) she was able to re-allocate her resources to meet her
                        reasonable needs without depleting her separate estate; (3) both of the parties had selected careers and been educated for their career plans prior to their marriage; (4) the parties lived beyond their means during the last four
                        years of their marriage; (5) subsequent to the parties' separation, the husband provided support to the wife which enabled her to obtain a full-time position at a university and to complete her training in order to meet her reasonable
                        economic needs; and (6) certain expenses would have to be cut and re-allocated by both parties in order to live within their means which was not the case during the last few years of their marriage. Friend-Novorska v. Novorska,

                        The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding alimony in the amount of $1,800.00 per month to plaintiff based in part on its consideration of defendant's financial benefits, such as health insurance, vehicle and reimbursed expenses received
                        through his company. Walker v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 414, 546 S.E.2d 625 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Because a husband's estate was substantially larger than a wife's estate, it would have been unfair to require the wife to further deplete her estate while allowing the husband to maintain his; because a modified alimony award required both parties to
                        deplete their estates to meet their living expenses, award was fair to both parties. Swain v. Swain, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 795, 635 S.E.2d 504 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 437</cite>,

                        Trial court was not required to find a change of circumstances in entering an alimony order in a divorce case because at the time of the hearing, the only order in effect was a postseparation support order, and the alimony award thus did not "modify"
                        a prior alimony order, but rather terminated an existing temporary postseparation support; because the wife failed to assign error to any of the trial court's findings of fact, they were binding on appeal, and absent a showing
                        that the trial court failed to make any finding as to a particular factor, the wife failed to demonstrate that the trial court's findings of fact were inadequate. Langdon v. Langdon, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite>                        471, 644 S.E.2d 600 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's alimony award to a wife was not an abuse of discretion because the husband's marital misconduct was shown, but the award had to be reconsidered in light of the required reconsideration of a related equitable distribution award. Dechkovskaia

                        Trial court did not err in awarding plaintiff 18 years of alimony, given in part that defendant engaged in martial misconduct, was always the sole means of support from the family and had a greater earning capacity than plaintiff, deliberately underreported
                        his income and filed false tax returns, and plaintiff was a dependent spouse in need of alimony and was functionally unemployable. Juhnn v. Juhnn, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 775 S.E.2d

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering a wife's current net monthly income in determining the alimony award because based on the evidence presented and consideration of the statutory factors, the trial court awarded the husband $ 1,750
                        per month in alimony; the wife's current net monthly income was $ 10,230, and her total monthly reasonable financial needs and expenses were $ 8,240. Burger v. Burger, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite>                        1, 790 S.E.2d 683 (2016).

                        Trial court's alimony award was affirmed because it made findings of fact regarding many of the factors; the trial court concluded that the award of alimony was equitable considering all relevant factors, and the relevant factors supported alimony in
                        the amount designated and for the designated duration. Gilmartin v. Gilmartin, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 822 S.E.2d 771 (2018), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 291</cite>,

                        Husband's motion to dismiss a wife's claim that he had engaged in "marital misconduct" was not properly presented by his appeal; where an unsuccessful motion to dismiss is grounded on an alleged insufficiency of the facts to state a claim for relief,

                        Failure to Consider Change in Circumstances. - While it made sufficient findings to support its determinations that the ex-wife was a dependent spouse, because the trial court abused its discretion by not considering alleged changes of circumstances occurring
                        after the first hearing before entering a lump sum retroactive alimony award, the appellate court had to vacate the lump sum award. Rhew v. Felton, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 631 S.E.2d

                        Where the trial court found that the ex-husband had a net monthly income of approximately $5,400 and reasonable monthly expenses in the amount of $4,200, yielding a surplus of $1,200, and the ex-wife's reasonable needs exceeded her income by $1,400, there
                        was no abuse of discretion in finding the ex-wife was a dependent spouse and the ex-husband was a supporting spouse and awarding the ex-wife $1,200 per month in alimony. Rhew v. Felton, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite>                        475, 631 S.E.2d 859, appeal dismissed, review denied, 636 S.E.2d 810 (2006).

                        Trial court did not simply recite that it had considered this list of factors; it made findings of fact regarding the relevant factors and properly set the duration of the alimony; there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court granting 10.5 years

                        a trial court was not allowed to reconsider a spouse's dependent spouse status, as that was adjudicated at initial alimony hearing; alimony could have been reduced to zero, but that did not result in loss of dependent spouse status.

                        Trial court abused its discretion in not accounting for a husband's portion of health insurance premium in calculating his net income because it should have considered the husband's portion of the health insurance premium as a reasonable living expense,
                        just as it did with the wife's health insurance expense. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826 S.E.2d 788 (2019).

                        Bankruptcy. - Even if a trial court erred by failing to find that a wife was a dependent spouse, the wife was still not entitled to an award of alimony, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A(a),
                        because the husband was in bankruptcy and unable to make alimony payments; thus, the wife lacked the "ability to collect" any sums that were awarded in alimony. Bodie v. Bodie, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 727
                        S.E.2d 11 (2012).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by making reductions to husband's monthly expenses because it found that he could reasonably lower his monthly living expenses by almost $1,500 by reducing his $134 telephone bill to $100, canceling his $55 cable
                        television subscription, reducing his $650 food expense to $400.00, reducing his $100 clothing expense to $50, stopping his $60 allowance to the children since he would be paying child support, reducing his $207 gift and special
                        occasion expense to $104, reducing his vacation and recreation expense from $450 to $100, and reducing his $60 grooming and hygiene expense to $20; additionally, the trial court found that the husband's $150 furniture payment would
                        soon end and his $400 credit card payments were a duplication of other expenses. Cunningham v. Cunningham, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 615 S.E.2d 675 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Consider Earning Capacity Not Erroneous. - Trial court properly declined to consider the husband's earning capacity when ruling on the wife's request for alimony because there was no evidence that the husband, a doctor, was intentionally depressing
                        the husband's income or in any way acting in bad faith; the trial court found that the husband's reduction in income was attributable to the fact that the husband's patients were not happy with the husband's services and were choosing
                        other doctors. Megremis v. Megremis, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 633 S.E.2d 117 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Depletion of Husband's Estate Proper. - Trial court did not err in modifying the husband's alimony obligation back to the date of his motion to modify alimony based upon depletion of his estate because it correctly considered the comparison of the estates
                        of the parties, nor did it abuse its discretion by basing the alimony award on a combination of the husband's estate and his current income recognizing that his estate would be depleted to maintain the alimony obligation during
                        his time of unemployment, even in the absence of bad faith or imputation of income for purposes of alimony. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 821 S.E.2d 210 (2018).

        Reduction of Voluntary Retirement Contributions.
       </b> - Trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that the ex-husband would have to reduce his voluntary retirement contributions to provide alimony sufficient to meet the ex-wife's basic needs as the wife had
                        substantial medical issues and could not work, while the husband was in good health and earned a substantial income. Klaver v. Klaver, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Feb. 17, 2021).

                    <p>
                        Change of Circumstances Not Shown. - Alimony was properly not modified because upon review of the relevant factors, a substantial change in circumstances was not shown with respect to the husband's income, or as to both parties' expenses or other relevant
                        factors. Kelly v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 747 S.E.2d 268 (2013).

                        him, which in fact prejudiced plaintiff. Juhnn v. Juhnn, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 775 S.E.2d 310 (2015).

                            The remedy of subsistence and counsel fees pendente lite is intended to enable the wife to maintain herself according to her station in life and to employ counsel to meet her husband at trial upon substantially equal terms. Little v. Little,

                            The purpose of the allowance of counsel fees pendente lite is to enable the wife (dependent spouse), as litigant, to meet the husband (supporting spouse), as litigant, on substantially even terms by making it possible for her to employ adequate counsel.

                            No Fees Awarded For Pro Bono Counsel. - Where the wife received pro bono counsel during the alimony proceedings, she was not entitled to an award of counsel fees under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.4" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.4</a></cite>,
                            as counsel fees referred only to fees paid by the wife to counsel for services rendered, and no such payment was made; the purpose of the statute was to even the playing field for a dependent spouse seeking alimony, and since
                            pro bono services were rendered there were no costs to shift. Patronelli v. Patronelli, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 320, 623 S.E.2d 322 (2006).

                            Appellate court did not err in affirming the trial court's ruling that denied the wife's request for an award of attorney fees in a divorce case where the wife was represented on a pro bono basis by her counsel through the Volunteer Lawyers Program; an
                            award of attorney fees, under the plain language of the relevant statute, would have to benefit and such an award under the circumstances could not do so because she was not obligated to pay counsel fees. Patronelli v. Patronelli,

                            contract in the equitable distribution proceeding, the parties must execute a separate agreement to provide for a fee in the divorce action that is not contingent upon the securing of the divorce. In re Cooper,

                            In an action for alimony and counsel fees pendente lite and for alimony without divorce, plaintiff, on the day set for hearing of the motion for alimony and counsel fees pendente lite, filed "certificate and affidavit" stating that there had been a reconciliation
                            between plaintiff and defendant and that plaintiff "withdraws and renounces the complaint" and "takes a voluntary nonsuit . . . and prays the court to dismiss" the action as of nonsuit. Plaintiff's attorneys filed petition
                            for counsel fees against defendant, and defendant's attorney filed plaintiff's "certificate and affidavit" as an affidavit in support of defendant's resistance to judgment allowing counsel fees against him. After the petition
                            was filed and after the court had announced its intention of allowing same, judgment as of nonsuit was tendered and signed by the court. It was held that at the time the petition for counsel fees was filed, the complaint was
                            still a part of the record and the action was still pending, and the petition amounted to a motion to have the court act upon the prayer as made by plaintiff in her complaint, and the action of the court in allowing counsel

                            she failed to act in good faith during the litigation, and as such, the trial court acted within its discretion when it denied her claim for attorneys' fees. Ellis v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite>                            239, 767 S.E.2d 413 (2014).

                            Decision Not Reviewable Absent Abuse or Error of Law. - Subsistence and counsel fees pendente lite are within the discretion of the court, and its decision is not reviewable except for abuse of discretion or for error of law. Griffith v. Griffith,

                            But Facts Required by Statute Must Be Alleged and Proved. - There is some language in Supreme Court decisions which leaves the impression that the allowance of counsel fees and subsistence pendente lite lies solely within the discretion of the trial judge,
                            and that such allowance is reviewable only upon a showing of an abuse of the judge's discretion. The correct rule is that the facts required by the statutes must be alleged and proved to support an order for subsistence pendente
                            lite. Guy v. Guy, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 343, 219 S.E.2d 291 (1975).

                            Elements to Be Considered. - In determining a pendente lite allowance of attorneys' fees, the nature and worth of the services, the magnitude of the task imposed, reasonable consideration for the defendant's condition and financial circumstances, and
                            many other considerations are involved. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 497</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 221 (1967).

                        <p>
                            When allowable, the amount of attorneys' fees in an action for alimony without divorce is within the sound discretion of the court below and is unappealable except for abuse of that discretion. The statute itself, however, contains some guides to the
                            exercise of that discretion, and practice has developed others. Within the rule of reasonableness the court must consider, along with other things, the condition and circumstances of the defendant. Stadiem v. Stadiem,

                        <p>
                            In making its determination of the proper amount of counsel fees which are to be awarded a dependent spouse as litigant or appellant, the trial court is under an obligation to conduct a broad inquiry, considering as relevant factors the nature and worth
                            of the services rendered, the magnitude of the task imposed upon counsel, and reasonable consideration for the parties' respective conditions and financial circumstances. Whedon v. Whedon,

                            Once attorneys' fees are authorized, a trial court must consider several factors in determining the amount of the award, including but not limited to each party's estate and ability to defray legal costs, the nature and scope of the legal services rendered
                            the dependent spouse, and the skill, time, and labor expended during such representation. Perkins v. Perkins, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 660, 355 S.E.2d 848, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 633</cite>,

                            Award Vacated. - Because the trial court's order denying alimony was vacated, and the case was remanded for additional findings as to whether a wife was entitled to alimony, that portion of the order denying the wife's claim for attorneys' fees was also
                            vacated. Carpenter v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 781 S.E.2d 828 (2016).

                            bonus." Even assuming such bonuses are allowed, as under federal practice, that should occur only in the rare case where the applicant specifically shows superior quality representation and exceptional success. Coastal Prod.

                            An award of attorneys' fees cannot be upheld where the court failed to make findings of fact upon which a determination of the reasonableness of the fees could be based, such as the nature and scope of the legal services rendered and the skill and time
                            required. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 267 S.E.2d 345 (1980).

                            Awards Held Erroneous for Lack of Findings. - The court erred in awarding plaintiff counsel fees pendente lite where no findings were made that plaintiff was entitled to the relief demanded, was a dependent spouse and had insufficient means whereon to
                            subsist during prosecution of the suit and to defray the necessary expenses thereof. Guy v. Guy, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 343, 219 S.E.2d 291 (1975).

                        <p>
                            The court erred in awarding counsel fees to the wife in a child support action where the court made no findings as to the wife's ability to pay or the reasonableness of the fees. Horner v. Horner, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite>                            334, 267 S.E.2d 65, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 89</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 297 (1980).

                        <p>
                            Factual findings on award of attorneys' fees were deficient as to child support where there was no finding that the supporting spouse refused to provide adequate support under circumstances existing at the time the action was initiated, and as to both
                            alimony and child support, where there were no factual findings upon which a determination of the reasonableness of the award could be based, other than the trial court's statement that the time expended was "reasonably necessary."

                        <p>
                            Because the trial court made no findings with regard to the wife's ability to subsist during prosecution of the suit or her ability to defray the necessary expenses of suit, its award of attorney fees in favor of the wife was improper. Swain v. Swain,

                            Remand for Findings. - Order awarding attorneys' fees which failed to satisfy requirement of findings as to the lawyer's skill, his hourly rate, its reasonableness in comparison with that of other lawyers, what he did, and the hours he spent was insufficient
                            and case would be remanded for appropriate findings as to attorneys' fees. Coleman v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 494, 328 S.E.2d 871 (1985).

                            The portion of an award denying attorney fees to the plaintiff wife was reversed and the matter was remanded where the trial court concluded that she was a dependent spouse, but did not make any findings regarding whether she was without sufficient means
                            to subsist during the prosecution of the suit and to defray the necessary expenses. Friend-Novorska v. Novorska, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 545 S.E.2d 788 (2001), aff'd,

                            Court's Findings Supported Denial of Attorney's Fees. - Trial court's findings that (1) a wife's income had increased from the date of separation until the date of the action, (2) the wife continued to live at the marital residence while the husband voluntarily
                            paid at least half of the monthly mortgage payments, (3) the husband paid the wife monthly post-separation support, and (4) the husband had previously paid $2,000 towards the wife's attorney's fees supported its conclusion
                            of law that the wife was able to subsist and defray the necessary expenses related to prosecuting the action and the denial of the wife's motion for attorney's fees. Friend-Novorska v. Novorska,

                        <p>
                            Findings Supported. - Order requiring a husband to pay a wife's attorney's fees was not an abuse of discretion because (1) the court properly relied on pleadings and the court record, including uncontested custody and support orders and a motion to continue,
                            (2) disparity of financial resources was not a required consideration, and (3) detailed findings supported the conclusion that the wife was a dependent spouse with insufficient means to defray litigation costs. Beasley v. Beasley,

                            Appeal as a Matter of Right. - An order requiring payment of alimony pendente lite and counsel fees affects a substantial right from which an appeal lies as a matter of right. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite>                            353, 183 S.E.2d 278 (1971).

                            When the statutory requirements have been met, the amount of an award of attorneys' fees is reviewable only for an abuse of discretion. Patton v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 247, 337 S.E.2d 607 (1985),

                        <p>
                            Fees Upheld. - Since the trial court found that the ex-wife was without sufficient means whereon to subsist during the prosecution of the action and to defray the necessary expenses of the action, the unchallenged findings were sufficient to support the
                            ex-wife's entitlement to attorney fees. Rhew v. Felton, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 631 S.E.2d 859, appeal dismissed, review denied, 636 S.E.2d 810 (2006).

                        <p>
                            Fees Reversed. - Although the wife would be required to deplete her estate to some extent in order to pay attorney's fees, and her estate was significantly smaller than the husband's, it was not unreasonable to expect her to pay $40,000 out of her $1.5
                            million estate to employ adequate counsel, and the trial court erred in awarding $40,000 in fees. Parsons v. Parsons, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 752 S.E.2d 530 (2013).

                            Order awarding attorney fees to a wife who was awarded alimony was reversed because the order was predicated upon a determination that the wife was a dependent spouse entitled to alimony, but the alimony award was reversed. Collins v. Collins,

                            Denial of Attorneys' Fees Held Interlocutory. - Denial of attorneys' fees under this section was not a final order of the trial court, where at the time appellant's motion was filed there had been no determination that his client, defendant, was entitled
                            to alimony pendente lite under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>, so that appellant was not yet entitled to attorneys' fees under this section, and
                            as appellant could appeal the denial of his motion after final judgment, or could bring a separate lawsuit to collect fees, no substantial right of appellant was affected by the Court of Appeals' failure to entertain an interlocutory

                            The issues of who is a dependent spouse and who is a supporting spouse present mixed questions of law and fact which can best be determined by the trial judge when he sets the amount of permanent alimony. Clarke v. Clarke,

                            Guidelines for determining whether a spouse is "dependent" or "supporting" must be based upon factual findings sufficiently specific to indicate that the trial judge properly considered the statutory factors and the rules which evolved from case law.
                            Otherwise, an appellate court cannot review the amount of alimony awarded to determine whether the trial judge abused his discretion. Quick v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 446</cite>, 290

                            Reduction of Alimony. - The amount of alimony to be awarded lies in the sound discretion of the trial judge. In the absence of abuse of that discretion, the award will not be disturbed. The same should be true for reduced alimony. Self v. Self,

                            To determine whether the dependent spouse was entitled to alimony and, if so, in what amount, the trial judge was required to weigh evidence of adultery by the supporting spouse as well as evidence of indignities offered by both the supporting and the
                            dependent spouse. Baker v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 792, 404 S.E.2d 20 (1991).

                            well as in determining the amount of alimony to be awarded, the courts must consider the factors enumerated in this section for determining the amount of alimony. These factors include the estates, earnings, earning capacity,
                            condition, and accustomed standard of living of the parties, and other facts of the particular case. Beaman v. Beaman, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 717, 336 S.E.2d 129 (1985).

                            The term "accustomed standard of living of the parties" in subsection (a) of this section completes the contemplated legislative meaning of "maintenance and support" in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.1(3)</a></cite>.
                            The latter phrase clearly means more than a level of mere economic survival. Plainly it contemplates the economic standard established by the marital partnership for the family unit during the years in which the marital contract
                            was intact. It anticipates that alimony, to the extent it can possibly do so, shall sustain that standard of living for the dependent spouse to which the parties together became accustomed. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 174</cite>,

                            Findings of Fact. - In the case of both alimony and alimony pendente lite, the order concerning the amount must be supported by a conclusion of law that such amount is necessary under the circumstances. This conclusion of law, in turn, must be supported
                            by specific findings of fact as to the estates, earnings, earning capacity, condition, and accustomed standard of living of the parties, as well as other relevant factors. Steele v. Steele,

                        <p>
                            The trial judge must at least make findings sufficiently specific to indicate proper consideration of each of the factors established by subsection (a) of this section for a determination of an alimony award. Spencer v. Spencer,

                            In determining the amount of alimony to be awarded, the trial judge must comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 52, i.e., he must find facts

                            Rule 52 requires specific findings of ultimate facts established by the evidence which determine the issues involved and are essential to support the conclusions of law.

                        <p>
                            To make a valid order for alimony, the trial court must make detailed findings concerning the following: (1) The estates of the parties; (2) the earnings of the parties; (3) the earning capacity of the parties; (4) the condition of the parties; and (5)
                            the accustomed standard of living of the parties. Skamarak v. Skamarak, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 343 S.E.2d 559 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Former husband's motion to modify alimony was properly denied because the trial court's finding that his income had not substantially decreased was supported by evidence that his income went through normal variations and fluctuations and that his average
                            annual income was more than his average income during the time period prior to the alimony order. Kelly v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 747 S.E.2d 268 (2013).

                            Failure of the trial court to make any findings as to the parties' expenses, accustomed standard of living, or plaintiff's financial obligations in awarding alimony constituted reversible error.

                            Conclusions of Law. - This section requires a conclusion of law that "circumstances render necessary" a designated amount of alimony, while case law requires conclusions of law that the supporting spouse is able to pay the designated amount and that the
                            amount is fair and just to all parties. Quick v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 446</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 653 (1982); Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 302 S.E.2d

                            In determining the needs of a dependent spouse, all of the circumstances of the parties should be taken into consideration, including the property, earnings, earning capacity, condition and accustomed standard of living of the parties. Sprinkle v. Sprinkle,

                            An order awarding alimony payments to a dependent spouse and support payments to a minor child must be founded upon proper consideration of the estates, earnings, earning capacity, conditions, accustomed standard of living of the parties or child, and
                            other facts of the particular case. Williamson v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 669, 202 S.E.2d 489 (1974).

                            Custodial Spouse's Caregiving Obligations. - While North Carolina's alimony statute does not contain express language which specifically allows consideration of the custodial spouse's caregiving obligations to the minor children, this consideration is
                            nonetheless consistent with the " 'overriding principle' " of " 'fairness' " which guides the determination of alimony, as well as the statutory provision contemplating regard of "other facts of the particular case." Fink v.

                            Needs and Capacity Must Be Considered. - While the court must consider the needs of the spouse seeking alimony in the context of the family unit's accustomed standard of living, it also must determine that the supporting spouse has the financial capacity
                            to provide the support needed therefor. Whedon v. Whedon, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 294 S.E.2d 29, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 752</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 764 (1982).

                            Parties' Assertions Need Not Be Taken at Face Value. - Determination of what constitutes reasonable needs and expenses of a party in an alimony action is within the discretion of the trial judge, and he is not required to accept at face value the assertion
                            of living expenses offered by the litigants themselves. Whedon v. Whedon, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 294 S.E.2d 29, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 752</cite>, 295

                            Ordinarily husband's (supporting spouse's) ability to pay is determined by his income at the time the award is made if the husband is honestly engaged in a business to which he is properly adapted and is in fact seeking to operate his business profitably.

                            If husband (supporting spouse) is honestly and in good faith engaged in a business to which he is properly adapted, and is making a good faith effort to earn a reasonable income, the award should be based on the amount which he is earning when the award
                            is made. Robinson v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 463, 179 S.E.2d 144 (1971).

                        <p>
                            The award should be based on the amount which defendant is earning when alimony is sought and the award made, if the husband (supporting spouse) is honestly engaged in a business to which he is properly adapted and is in fact seeking to operate his business
                            profitably. Conrad v. Conrad, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 412</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 912 (1960); Broughton v. Broughton, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 778, 294 S.E.2d 772, cert. denied,

                            Unless the court finds that a supporting spouse is deliberately depressing his income in disregard of his marital obligation to provide reasonable support, and applies the "capacity to earn"rule, a supporting spouse's ability to pay alimony is ordinarily
                            determined by his income at the time the award is made. Whedon v. Whedon, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 294 S.E.2d 29, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 752</cite>, 295

                            The granting of a support allowance and the amount thereof does not necessarily depend upon the earnings of the husband (supporting spouse), and one who is able-bodied and capable of earning may be ordered to pay subsistence. Robinson v. Robinson,

                            Capacity to earn may be the basis of an award if it is based upon a proper finding that the husband (supporting spouse) is deliberately depressing his income or indulging himself in excessive spending because of a disregard of his marital obligation to
                            provide reasonable support for wife (dependent spouse) and children. Beall v. Beall, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 669</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 407 (1976); Broughton v.

                        <p>
                            To base an award on capacity to earn rather than actual earnings, there should be a finding based on evidence that husband (supporting spouse) is failing to exercise his capacity to earn because of a disregard of his marital obligation to provide reasonable
                            support for wife (dependent spouse) and children. Robinson v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 463, 179 S.E.2d 144 (1971).

                        <p>
                            While an award of alimony may be based upon the supporting spouse's ability to earn as distinguished from his actual income, the rule seems to be applied only when it appears from the record that there has been a deliberate attempt on the part of the
                            supporting spouse to avoid financial family responsibilities by refusing to seek or to accept gainful employment; by willfully refusing to secure or take a job; by deliberately not applying himself to business; by intentionally
                            depressing income to an artificial low; or by intentionally leaving employment to go into another business. Bowes v. Bowes, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 163</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 40 (1975).

                            Unless the supporting spouse is deliberately depressing his or her income or indulging in excessive spending because of a disregard of the marital obligation to provide support for the dependent spouse, the ability of the supporting spouse to pay is ordinarily
                            determined by his or her income at the time the award is made. If the supporting spouse is deliberately depressing income or engaged in excessive spending, then capacity to earn, instead of actual income, may be the basis of
                            the award. Quick v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 446</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 653 (1982).

                            The court must consider the estate and earnings of both husband and wife in arriving at the sum which is just and proper for the husband (supporting spouse) to pay the wife (dependent spouse), either as temporary or permanent alimony; it is a question
                            of fairness and justice to both. Sayland v. Sayland, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 378</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 218 (1966); Beall v. Beall, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 669</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 407 (1976);

                            The primary purpose for considering the parties' estates is to assist the court in determining the parties' earnings and earning capacities. Ordinarily, the parties will not be required to deplete their estates to pay alimony or to meet personal expenses.

                            Standard of Living Determinations. - Although the court did not make any detailed findings as to the couple's accustomed standard of living, where the findings which it made allowed the court to determine the couple's accustomed standard of living, a
                            specific finding regarding the standard of living was not necessary. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 367 S.E.2d 408 (1988).

                            in all cases to make findings of fact on the question of the dependent spouse's earning capacity. Upchurch v. Upchurch, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 658, 239 S.E.2d 701 (1977), cert.

                            Finding on Earning Capacities Not Required Where Evidence Is Insufficient. - Although the spouses' earning capacities is a factor for the court to consider under this section, there is no requirement that the court make a specific finding of fact where
                            there is not sufficient evidence of the parties' earning capacities. Beaman v. Beaman, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 717, 336 S.E.2d 129 (1985).

                            Where husband (supporting spouse) has substantial income as compared to the limited income of wife (dependent spouse), the court is required by subsection (a) of this section to award the wife such alimony as will allow her to live as the wife of a man

                            Finding on Income of Supporting Spouse. - Although a proper finding pertaining to the income of the supporting spouse must be based on present, as opposed to past, income, there is no rule that requires a specific finding as to the income of the supporting

                            Determination of Gross Income Was Proper. - There was no error where judge determined husband's monthly gross income from February 1986 through January 1987 by subtracting the expenses of husband's business from its deposits and dividing the sum by 12;
                            the figures pertaining to deposits and expenses were furnished by husband's own testimony and by his own exhibits, and the judge also made a finding as to husband's indebtedness in areas unrelated to his business. Adams v.

                            this evidence, the lack of a specific finding on this matter did not constitute reversible error. Beaman v. Beaman, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 717, 336 S.E.2d 129 (1985).

                            Dependent Spouse of Wealthy Man Is Entitled to Live as Such. - When the evidence shows a substantial estate in the supporting spouse, and the dependent spouse is entitled to alimony, subsection (a) of this section requires the court to enter an order
                            for alimony which will enable the dependent spouse to live as the wife of a man with such an estate is entitled to live. Quick v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 280 S.E.2d

                            Trial court's finding in an alimony action that all of the items in a budget submitted by defendant wife were not "needed or necessary" items did not show that the court applied an improper standard in determining the amount of alimony for the wife of
                            a wealthy man, since it was clear that the court considered what expenses were necessary to maintain the standard of living of a woman who was married to a man of substantial means rather than what was necessary to maintain
                            bare subsistence. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 123</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 58 (1980).

                            Income tax consequences are among factors properly considered in awarding alimony under subsection (a) of this section, and they should be given appropriate importance in determining the amount of alimony required to meet the reasonable needs of the dependent
                            spouse. Whedon v. Whedon, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 294 S.E.2d 29, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 752</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 764 (1982).

                        <p>
                            While it is true that the express language of subsection (a) of this section does not include the income tax consequences of an award of alimony as a factor to be weighed in the balance in determining the proper amount of the award, such would be a proper
                            consideration in making that determination. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 123</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 58 (1980).

                            Tax Consequences Cannot Be Disregarded. - Consideration of the tax consequences is not preeminent in determining an alimony award, since it is but one consideration among the many to be weighed by the trial court. However, to disregard the effect of taxation
                            on such an award would be to flirt with an unrealistic, and potentially unjust, result. Perkins v. Perkins, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 660, 355 S.E.2d 848 (1987).

                            should fix a definite dollar amount for defendant husband to expend for this purpose. Kearns v. Kearns, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 170 S.E.2d 132 (1969), overruled on other grounds,

                            his wife (dependent spouse). Kearns v. Kearns, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 170 S.E.2d 132 (1969), overruled on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 285

                            Change in Financial Need or Dependency. - On a motion to modify or terminate an order of alimony, it is appropriate for the trial court to consider whether the dependent spouse's financial need or dependency has changed, as it relates to the factors listed
                            in this section. Cunningham v. Cunningham, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 430</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 403 (1997).

                        <p>
                            Conclusion Not Supported by Findings. - The trial court's conclusion that plaintiff-wife was the dependent spouse entitled to support was not supported by the findings of fact where the court found that defendant husband's income "is very significantly
                            lower than same has been in the past" and that "plaintiff is unable to continue to maintain her accustomed station in life"; there was no finding or evidence that defendant deliberately depressed his income in an effort to
                            avoid his obligations; and it was apparent that the trial court disregarded defendant's own inability to maintain the station in life to which he was formerly accustomed in its determination of dependency. Taylor v. Taylor,
                            <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 265 S.E.2d 626 (1980).

                            A conclusion of law that there has been a substantial change of circumstances based only on income is inadequate and in error. Self v. Self, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 377 S.E.2d 800 (1989).

                            Findings Held Insufficient to Support Award. - Where the trial court made certain findings as to the estate, income and expenses of plaintiff, but failed to make sufficient findings as to the estate, earnings, income and expenses of defendant, the trial
                            court did not find sufficient facts to support its award of alimony. Eudy v. Eudy, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 211 S.E.2d 536, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 71</cite>,

                            The trial court's failure to make any findings regarding plaintiff's reasonable current financial needs and expenses and the ratio of those needs and expenses to her income constituted error. Self v. Self, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite>                            323, 377 S.E.2d 800 (1989).

                            Modifying Court May Make Independent and Additional Findings. - Modification of an alimony award requires consideration of this section's standards, but this mandate does not limit a modifying court to only those findings of fact made by the court which
                            entered the original alimony order or that the modifying court cannot make additional and independent findings of fact under this section as to the parties' health and financial needs existing at the time of the original alimony
                            order based on evidence presented at the modification hearing. Self v. Self, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 377 S.E.2d 800 (1989).

                            Alimony Held Excessive. - Alimony payments of $230.00 every four weeks, which was slightly more than three times the cost of the wife's actual subsistence in a State mental hospital at a cost of $75.00 a month, even including the cost of guardianship,
                            exceeded "reasonable subsistence." Sayland v. Sayland, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 378</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 218 (1966).

                            Evidence of Financial Status of Corporation Controlled by Supporting Spouse. - In an action seeking permanent alimony, evidence of the financial status of a corporation in which defendant supporting spouse owned more than 96% of the stock was relevant
                            and competent in determining the size of his estate for the purpose of setting the amount of alimony to which plaintiff was entitled. Quick v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 248,

                            Failure to Separate Out Business Expenses. - "Alimony" means payment for the support and maintenance of a spouse; it does not mean payment for the support and maintenance of a spouse's business ventures. Therefore, the court erred in failing to determine
                            and to consider the extent to which defendant's business expenses as an artist duplicated her personal expenses. Beaman v. Beaman, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 717, 336 S.E.2d 129 (1985).

                            Admission by Supporting Spouse. - Testimony of husband testified that he was an able-bodied man and had the ability to provide ample support set at rest his ability to support his wife at the same level that she had become accustomed to during the marriage,
                            since proof is not required for that which has been judicially admitted. Ahern v. Ahern, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 728, 306 S.E.2d 140 (1983).

                        <p>
                            Pleading Held Insufficient. - Trial court did not err by finding wife's pleadings were insufficient on their face and dismissing her action for alimony and alimony pendente lite; plaintiff asserted in her complaint that she was a "dependent spouse," but
                            the only support she offered for this conclusion was evidence of her husband's salary and she did not present any evidence that she needed assistance to subsist during the prosecution or defense of the suit. Shook v. Shook,

                            Statutory Requirements Must Be Followed. - In determining the amount of alimony and child support to be awarded, the trial judge must follow the requirements of this section. The amount is a reasonable subsistence, to be determined by the trial judge
                            in the exercise of a judicial discretion from the evidence before him. Beall v. Beall, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 669</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 407 (1976); Quick v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 446</cite>,

                            The amount to be awarded is a question of fairness to the parties, and, so long as the court has properly taken into consideration the factors enumerated by statute, the award will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Gardner v. Gardner,

                            While the factors which are delineated in this section must be considered by the judge in determining the amount of alimony to be awarded in a given case, his determination of the proper amount may not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of
                            abuse of discretion. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 123</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 58 (1980); Payne v. Payne, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 132, 270 S.E.2d 546 (1980).

                            Proper Exercise of Discretion Is Question of Law. - Proper exercise of the trial judge's authority in granting alimony, alimony pendente lite, or counsel fees is a question of law, reviewable on appeal. Rickert v. Rickert,

                            Conclusion Not Disturbed on Appeal Where Supported, Despite Contradictions. - Although plaintiff's testimony on cross-examination tended to contradict her assertion that her illness was incapacitating, the trial court considered this evidence and concluded
                            that the plaintiff's medical condition prevented her from undertaking any meaningful employment and that she was unable to work and earn income to defray her own expenses; this conclusion was supported by the testimony of the
                            plaintiff, and despite contradictions, it would not be disturbed on appeal. Brandt v. Brandt, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 374 S.E.2d 663 (1988), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 429</cite>,

                            Effect of Dependent Spouse's Conduct on Right to Alimony. - The legislature has seen fit to leave the question of whether indignities committed by a wife (dependent spouse) prior to separation should absolutely bar her right to alimony arising out of
                            her husband's (supporting spouse's) adultery, or merely reduce the amount, for resolution by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion on a case-by-case basis.

                            Subsection (a) is similar in language and import to prior law. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420 (1971).

                            Court Must Make Findings If Adultery Is Pleaded. - When adultery is pleaded in bar of a demand for alimony or alimony pendente lite, an award or allowance of alimony pendente lite will not be sustained in the absence of a finding of fact on the issue
                            of adultery in favor of the party seeking such an award. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420 (1971).

                            In a wife's action for alimony without divorce in which defendant's answer sets up the defense of adultery, it is error for the court to order temporary alimony to plaintiff without finding the facts with respect to the plea of adultery. Williams v. Williams,
                            <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 660</cite>, 55 S.E.2d 195 (1949).

                            Evidence of Adultery. - While authority for blood-grouping tests is limited to an issue of paternity, in a case in which the issue is raised the results of the tests, if they exclude defendant as the father of a child admittedly born during the subsistence
                            of the marriage, would also be evidence of adultery. Wright v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 159</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 317 (1972).

                            Effect of Post-Divorce Sexual Activity. - This section is not an expression of legislative intent that post-divorce indiscriminate sexual activity by a former wife should bar her right to continue to receive alimony from her former husband. Stallings
                            v. Stallings, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 244 S.E.2d 494, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 648</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 249 (1978).

                            There is no statute that allows the court to modify an award of alimony solely because of post-marital fornication. Stallings v. Stallings, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 244 S.E.2d 494, cert. denied,

                            What Constitutes "Separation Agreement". - To be a "separation agreement," there must be an agreement to separate or to live separately and apart. Robuck v. Robuck, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 201 S.E.2d
                            557 (1974).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Gross income," as used in a separation agreement under which the husband agreed that after three years he would pay alimony in an amount equivalent to 30% of his gross income, included the gain realized from the sale of property. Heater v. Heater,
                            <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 587, 302 S.E.2d 891 (1983).

                        <p>
                            The jurisdiction of the court is not barred by a prior separation agreement between the parties. Garner v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 293</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 46 (1967), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But Unimpeached Deed of Separation May Bar Alimony. - A wife who, in a valid deed of separation, has released her husband from his support obligation is remitted to her rights under the agreement, and as long as the deed of separation stands unimpeached,
                            the court is without power to award her alimony and counsel fees. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 48</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 227 (1964).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wife sought a divorce a mensa and alimony, notwithstanding the provisions of a valid separation agreement which the husband had "fully performed," could not, after her husband had performed his part of the contract, obtain an award of alimony. Wilson
                            v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 40</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 240 (1964).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A deed of separation, approved by a consent judgment, could be pleaded as complete bar to the wife's application for alimony pendente lite and for reasonable counsel fees, as provided by former G.S. 50-15. Brown v. Brown,
                            <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 64</cite>, 169 S.E. 818 (1933).

                        <p>
                            However, resumption of marital relations rescinds deed of separation. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 48</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 227 (1964).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Agreement Did Not Waive Alimony Rights. - Defendant's execution of a separation agreement which stated that it was executed with "the express understanding" and "in full satisfaction of all obligations" did not constitute an express waiver of her alimony
                            rights within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.052.html#t52s52-10.1" target="_blank">G.S. 52-10.1</a></cite> or this section where the preamble to the agreement referred
                            to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20" target="_self">G.S. 50-20</a></cite>, an equitable distribution statute, thus excluding issues of spousal support. Napier v. Napier, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 364,

                        <p>
                            Discontinuance of Payments Under Separation Agreement. - Where, by an agreement for a separation between husband and wife, the former agreed to pay a certain monthly allowance, and the husband, after paying several installments, discontinued the payments,
                            he could not set up the agreement in bar of her action for support under this section, even though he discontinued the payments because she demanded that the allowance be increased. Cram v. Cram,
                            <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 288</cite>, 21 S.E. 197 (1895).

                            Election to Seek Alimony Rather Than Damages for Breach of Contract to Support. - When a wife, in an action for alimony without divorce, elects to seek alimony rather than damages for the breach of the contract to support her, she is only entitled to
                            such an award as would be proper if no contract had been signed. If there has been a partial performance, she must account for the net benefits, if any, which she may have received. Wilson v. Wilson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 40</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 240 (1964).

                            Attempt to Set Aside Settlement. - The eminence, experience, and character of counsel who represented the plaintiff in procuring a property settlement would bear directly on plaintiff's subsequent attempt to set it aside as fraudulent. Van Every v. Van
                            Every, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 506</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 603 (1965), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>.

                            where wife sued for alimony and support without divorce on grounds of specific acts of cruelty by husband and declared intention to sue for divorce in two years. Butler v. Butler, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 594</cite>,
                            39 S.E.2d 745 (1946).

                            Setting Out Separation Agreement in Record on Appeal. - Where defendant resisted his wife's application for alimony without divorce under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>,
                            upon the ground that there was still in effect a valid contract of separation which they had both executed, and appealed from an adverse decision of the trial judge hearing the matter, the record on appeal should have set out
                            the written contract of separation so that the Supreme Court could determine whether it was reasonable, just and fair to the wife, and whether in taking her acknowledgment the officer had properly certified that it was not
                            unreasonable or injurious to her, as the statutes then required. Moore v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 332</cite>, 117 S.E. 12 (1923).

                            Post-Separation Failure to Provide Necessary Subsistence. - Absent a valid separation agreement waiving all alimony rights under subsection (b) of this section, post-separation failure to provide a dependent-spouse with necessary subsistence gives rise
                            to an action for alimony. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 410 S.E.2d 223 (1991), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 383</cite>, 417 S.E.2d 789 (1992).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Summary judgment was appropriate where a premarital agreement signed by the parties irrefutably barred the wife's claims for postseparation support, alimony and equitable distribution; the language in the subject agreement - drafted by the wife's attorney
                            - was sufficiently "express" to constitute a valid and enforceable waiver of the wife's claims for postseparation support pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.2" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.2</a></cite>A
                            and alimony pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>A. Stewart v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 236, 541 S.E.2d 209 (2000).

                        the court may order. The court may order the transfer of title to real property solely owned by the obligor in payment of lump-sum payments of alimony or postseparation support or in payment of arrearages of alimony or postseparation

                            of the wife (dependent spouse) is the limit of the court's authority. It cannot penalize defendant unless and until he refuses to comply with the court's direction. Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 416</cite>,

                            The court has no power to order a lump sum payment either to punish the supporting spouse or to divide his estate. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 265 S.E.2d 626 (1980).

                            The trial court had no power to order defendant husband to make a lump sum payment of $50,000.00 to plaintiff wife where it was apparent that the effect of the court's order would be to force defendant to liquidate, either by sale or mortgage, his only
                            remaining assets having any substantial value, not for the purpose of paying for the maintenance and support of defendant, but in order to effect a division of his estate with her. Taylor v. Taylor,

                            Trial court's creation of a trust consisting of certain real and personal property owned by the parties in order to secure the payment of alimony and child support was a proper exercise of its discretion in applying the provisions of
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.4ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.4(e)</a></cite> and of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, and would be affirmed. Weaver v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 634,

                            Corpus of Estate May Be Assigned to Secure Allowance. - The court is authorized to assign the corpus of the husband's (supporting spouse's) property to secure the allowance, and therefore it is immaterial to defendant whether the home place is taken and
                            rents and profits therefrom used to provide a suitable residence for the wife (dependent spouse) and children or whether they are granted the right of occupancy of the home place, and it being found that such arrangement is
                            most feasible and appropriate, the order will not be disturbed. Wright v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 693</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 555 (1940).

                            Alimony Pendente Lite May Be Decreed a Lien. - Where alimony pendente lite has been regularly granted to the wife in her action for divorce against her nonresident husband, who has abandoned her, the court may decree it a lien upon his lands described
                            in the complaint and situated here, and order the sale thereof for its payment; and it is not necessary that the defendant should have had notice of the wife's application therefor. Bailey v. Bailey,

                            supporting spouse to post a security bond to secure his compliance with a judgment requiring him to make monthly payments for support of his wife and children, where the court found that defendant no longer resided within the

                            of the decree, the fact that in a part of the land he has only a defeasible fee cannot prejudice him, and his exception on that ground cannot be sustained. Anderson v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 139</cite>,

                            Receiver May Collect Income and Sell Realty to Pay Alimony. - In a wife's (dependent spouse's) action for alimony without divorce, a receiver appointed therein to take possession of the husband's (supporting spouse's) property within the State may collect
                            the income from the husband's realty for the purpose of paying alimony awarded the wife in the action and may sell the husband's real estate if necessary to pay the alimony decreed. Lambeth v. Lambeth,

                            as provided in Article 6 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.053.html" target="_blank">Chapter 53</a></cite>, so as to produce an income sufficient to enable the receiver appointed to

                            Rents and Profits in Estate by Entireties Are Chargeable. - Where husband and wife own land by entireties, the rents and profits of the husband (supporting spouse) therein may be charged with the support of the wife (dependent spouse) and the minor children
                            of the marriage upon his abandonment of her, in an action for alimony without divorce, and for her counsel fees by Laws 1921, c. 123, in these proceedings; and to enforce an order allowing her alimony and attorneys' fees, according
                            to the statutes, a writ of possession may issue, to apply thereto the rents and profits as they shall accrue and become personalty; and an order for the sale of land conveying the fee simple title for the purpose of paying
                            the allowance is erroneous. Holton v. Holton, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 355</cite>, 119 S.E. 751 (1923); Porter v. Citizens Bank, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 573</cite>, 111 S.E.2d 904 (1960).

                            But Sale of Such Estate May Not Be Ordered. - The court does not have the power to order the sale of land held as tenants by the entireties to procure funds to pay alimony to the wife (dependent spouse) or to pay her counsel fees. Porter v. Citizens Bank,
                            <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 573</cite>, 111 S.E.2d 904 (1960).

                            Although the rents and profits therefrom and the actual possession thereof may be made available for the support of the wife (dependent spouse), the court does not have the power to order the sale of land owned by husband and wife as tenants by the entirety

                            Possession of Real or Personal Property as Alimony. - There is no requirement that alimony be denominated as such for it to be a valid award of alimony. Furthermore, possession of real or personal property, including the marital home, is one form of alimony
                            provided by statute. Minor v. Minor, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 318 S.E.2d 865, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 495</cite>, 322 S.E.2d 558 (1984).

                            these sections do not require it to do so. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 262 S.E.2d 659, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 123</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 58 (1980).

                            While a trial court has the authority to order payment of alimony by possession of real property under subsection (a) of this section, as well as the power to issue a writ of possession when necessary under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-17" target="_self">G.S. 50-17</a></cite>,
                            the pertinent statutory provisions do not require it to do so. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 123</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 58 (1980).

                            This section in no way renders it mandatory or incumbent upon the trial court to order any transfer of property as part of alimony. Spillers v. Spillers, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 261, 212 S.E.2d 676 (1975).

                            This section does not authorize the court to direct that alimony be paid by the transfer of title to real estate. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 592, 216 S.E.2d 737 (1975).

                            Subsections (b) and (c) of this section do not enlarge the authority given the trial judge in subsection (a). Rather, these subsections enable the court to order a transfer of title to real property to secure an award of alimony made under subsection
                            (a). Thus, the trial judge may order the transfer of title to real property, but only if it is necessary to insure the payment of alimony. Gilbert v. Gilbert, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite>                            160, 321 S.E.2d 455 (1984).

                            Power to Transfer Personalty Dependent on Alimony Power. - Although subsection (a) of this section clearly vests the court with power to order a transfer of personalty, that power does not exist independently of the court's power to order alimony for
                            the dependent spouse. This section contemplates such transfers only in terms of satisfaction of the obligation to support. Where the court was not ordering a transfer of property as payment of alimony, the statute was, therefore,
                            inapplicable. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 262 S.E.2d 659, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 123</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 58 (1980).

                            Court order requiring defendant to secure payment of temporary alimony by means of deed of trust did not give to plaintiff fixed or permanent interest as cestui que trust, or any right to the entire proceeds of foreclosure sale under deed of trust; the
                            order simply provided a means of securing payment of alimony, and the court was not required to find a change of circumstances as a basis for ordering the payment of a part of the proceeds of foreclosure sale to satisfy a judgment

                            Validity and Enforceability of Consent Judgment. - In an action for alimony without divorce, a judgment, entered by consent of the parties, which orders defendant to make alimony payments to his wife (dependent spouse), is valid and is enforceable against
                            the husband (supporting spouse) by attachment for contempt, notwithstanding the absence of allegations or findings that the separation was caused by the misconduct of the husband. Whitesides v. Whitesides,

                            Where consent judgment ordered that plaintiff pay alimony in a certain amount per month and that if either party willfully failed to comply with and perform the terms and conditions of the separation agreement, the court could hold the breaching party
                            in contempt of court, and the divorce decree ordered that the consent judgment should remain in effect according to the respective terms and conditions and applicable law, the judgment was actually an adjudication by the court
                            which was enforceable by contempt and subject to modification upon a change of conditions, rather than a contract approved by the court which could not be modified absent a consent of the parties. Britt v. Britt,

                            Divorce Actions Awarding Alimony Remain Open for Enforcement. - Divorce actions in which alimony is awarded are not ended merely by the rendition of judgment. Such actions are always open for motions in the cause for the enforcement of the order for alimony.

                            Alimony and Child Support Considered Together. - Although alimony and child support were normally subjects to be considered separately, there might be circumstances that would warrant considering them together. Such was true in the wife's case where she
                            sought and the trial court granted an increase in alimony because the original award attributed only half of some reasonable expenses to the wife because some expenses were attributed to the minor child, and those reasonable
                            expenses increased for the wife after the minor child turned 18-years-old and the child support award was terminated. Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 656 S.E.2d

                            An action is not ended by the rendition of a judgment, but is still pending until the judgment is satisfied for the purpose of motions affecting the judgment but not the merits of the original controversy, especially judgments allowing alimony with or
                            without divorce, and where the defendant makes a general appearance in the original action for subsistence without divorce in which judgment is duly rendered for plaintiff, the court acquires jurisdiction over defendant by
                            the proper service of notice of plaintiff's subsequent petition to recover past due installments, and defendant may not challenge the court's jurisdiction to hear plaintiff's motion and petition for such recovery by special
                            appearance. Barber v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 232</cite>, 4 S.E.2d 447 (1939).

                            Where the obligor under a judgment awarding alimony and child support is in arrears in the periodic payment of the alimony and child support, the court may, upon motion in the cause, judicially determine the amount then properly due and enter its final
                            judgment for the total then properly due, and execution may issue thereon. Lindsey v. Lindsey, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 237 S.E.2d 561 (1977).

                            Attachment Will Lie. - An attachment against the husband's (supporting spouse's) land will lie in favor of the wife (dependent spouse) abandoned by him, for a reasonable subsistence or allowance adjudged by the court, under the implied contract that he
                            support and maintain her, under the statute declaring and enforcing it and under the order of court; and attachment of the husband's land is a basis for the publication of summons. Walton v. Walton,

                            A proper order for reasonable subsistence and counsel fees pendente lite may be enforced against a nonresident or absconding husband (supporting spouse) by attachment against his property without notice, and in such case the court may also appoint a receiver
                            to collect the income from the husband's property. Perkins v. Perkins, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 91</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 356 (1950).

                            Writ of Possession. - To enforce an order allowing alimony and counsel fees pursuant to the provisions of this section, the court may issue a writ of possession pursuant to the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-17" target="_self">G.S. 50-17</a></cite>,
                            giving the wife (dependent spouse) possession of property held by her and her husband (supporting spouse) as tenants by the entireties, in order that she may apply the rents and profits therefrom, as they shall accrue and become
                            personalty, to the payment of alimony and counsel fees as fixed by the court. Porter v. Citizens Bank, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 573</cite>, 111 S.E.2d 904 (1960).

                            Priority of Claim. - The wife's (dependent spouse's) inchoate right to alimony makes her a creditor of her husband (supporting spouse) and is enforceable by attachment, in case of her abandonment, which puts everyone on notice of her claim and her priority
                            over other creditors of her husband. Walton v. Walton, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 73</cite>, 100 S.E. 176 (1919).

                        <p>
                            Where the wife (dependent spouse) has obtained an order for support from her husband (supporting spouse), which has been declared a lien on his property under this section, in order for her to intervene in an action in another jurisdiction and claim priority
                            over an attachment therein issued, it is necessary that she should show some valid service of process or waiver by her husband in an appropriate civil action against him. In this case it was questioned whether the lien of the
                            wife would in any event prevail as against the lien of a valid attachment first levied in another court of equal concurrent jurisdiction. Mitchell v. Talley, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 683</cite>,
                            109 S.E. 882 (1921).

                        <p>
                            An order was entered in a divorce cause to the effect that if a deed of trust on property held by the husband and wife by the entireties was foreclosed, the husband's share of the surplus should be secured for the payment of the alimony awarded. The deed
                            of trust was foreclosed and the trustee voluntarily paid in the office of the clerk the surplus realized in the sale. In an action on account instituted by a creditor of the husband prior to the sale, a warrant of attachment
                            was issued and the husband's share in the surplus attached on the date it was put in the hands of the clerk. It was held that there having been no attachment of the funds in the divorce action, nor the surplus placed in custodia
                            legis in that action, and the orders issued therein not constituting a lien in futuro upon such funds, the lien of the attaching creditor was superior to the rights of the wife therein. Porter v. Citizens Bank,
                            <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 573</cite>, 111 S.E.2d 904 (1960).

                            Unless Decree Constitutes Lien, Arrears Must Be Reduced to Judgment Before Execution. - A decree for periodic payments of alimony and support, in the absence of a provision in the decree itself which constitutes it a specific lien upon the property of
                            the obligor, is not enforceable by execution until the arrears are reduced to judgment by a judicial determination of the amount then due. This is so because the decree for alimony and support may be modified as circumstances
                            may justify. Lindsey v. Lindsey, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 237 S.E.2d 561 (1977).

                            Income from Trust Administered in State Is Subject to Execution. - In a wife's (dependent spouse's) action for divorce from bed and board and for permanent alimony, the husband's (supporting spouse's) income from a trust created in another jurisdiction
                            and administered by a trustee bank in this State is subject to execution to satisfy the judgment of the wife against the husband for alimony, child support and counsel fees. Swink v. Swink,

                            Garnishment of Wages. - Garnishment of defendant's wages for payment of alimony was not improper since defendant's future earnings were not garnished and since defendant was not entitled to a 60-day exemption because he could not show that his earnings
                            were necessary for the use of a family supported wholly or partly by his labor. Sturgill v. Sturgill, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 580, 272 S.E.2d 423 (1980).

                            to clear and substantial federal interests. Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 175, 292 S.E.2d 775, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 684</cite>, 300

                            decree or the agreement until he sought to defend his failure to comply with the judgment on grounds that it was void, he was estopped from questioning its validity and effect. Amick v. Amick,

                            Vested or Accrued Payments. - If under subsection (a), the court has ordered alimony in a single lump sum payment and this lump sum has not been paid, such alimony has vested or accrued and similarly, if under subsection (a), the court has ordered alimony
                            in periodic payments and payments have come due but have not been paid, these payments have also vested or accrued; in either case, the dependent spouse's remarriage would not terminate the ordered amounts that had vested or
                            accrued by virtue of being "due and payable." Potts v. Tutterow, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 97</cite>, 455 S.E.2d 156, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 364</cite>, 458 S.E.2d

                            remarriage terminated the monthly alimony obligations not yet due and payable, as they had not vested prior to remarriage. Potts v. Tutterow, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 97</cite>, 455 S.E.2d

                            With Willful Failure Punishable by Imprisonment. - A willful failure of husband (supporting spouse) to comply with court's order to pay to the wife (dependent spouse) the amount fixed by order of the court, having due regard to the situation of the parties,
                            the ability of the husband to pay, and the needs of the wife is a contempt, and can be punished as such by imprisonment, and is not within the constitutional inhibition against imprisonment for debt. Wilson v. Wilson,

                            Trial Court Has Jurisdiction to Enforce Alimony Order During Appeal. - Trial court did not lack authority to enter contempt order and initial show cause order against defendant where defendant had appealed original order for periodic alimony payments;
                            appeal did not remove jurisdiction of trial court under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-294" target="_blank">G.S. 1-294</a></cite> since this section dictates that

                            Agreement of Parties Incorporated in Judgment Is Enforceable by Contempt Proceedings. - Where, in wife's action for alimony and child support, the parties agreed to the terms of a judgment providing that husband would make specified monthly support payments,
                            and the judgment entered by the court ordered the husband to make the payments which he had agreed to make, the husband's obligation to make the support payments could be enforced by contempt proceedings. Parker v. Parker,

                            Contempt in Failure to Comply with Consent Judgment. - Under a consent judgment entered in an action by a husband against his wife where no pleadings were filed, providing for certain money payments in lieu of alimony by the husband to the wife and that
                            it should be more than a simple judgment for debt and as binding upon plaintiff as if rendered under this section, and also providing that, upon proper cause shown, it would subject husband to such penalties as the court might
                            require in case of contempt of its orders, the court could commit the plaintiff upon his failure to make the payments required. Edmundson v. Edmundson, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 181</cite>,

                            Although a judgment may be entered by consent, based on a written agreement, if such judgment orders and decrees that the husband shall pay certain sums as alimony for the support of his wife, a willful refusal to make the payments as directed therein
                            will subject the husband in a proper proceeding to attachment for contempt. Stancil v. Stancil, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 507</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 882 (1961).

                            One does not act "willfully" in failing to comply with a judgment if it has not been within his power to do so since the judgment was rendered. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                        <p>
                            The trial court must find as a fact that the defendant possessed the means to comply with orders of the court during the period when he was in default. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194

                        <p>
                            Where the court enters judgment as for civil contempt, the court must find not only failure to comply with the order but that the defendant presently possesses the means to comply. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Where the lower court had not found as a fact that defendant possessed the means to comply with the orders for payment of subsistence pendente lite at any time during the period when he was in default in such payments, the finding that defendant's failure
                            to make the payments of subsistence was deliberate and willful was not supported by the record, and the decree committing him to imprisonment for contempt would be set aside. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                        <p>
                            An order for a defendant's arrest for willful contempt of an earlier court order requiring him to make alimony payments would be remanded where there was no evidence to support a finding that defendant presently possessed the means to comply with the
                            alimony order. Earnhardt v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 213, 175 S.E.2d 744 (1970).

                        <p>
                            Evidence of Willful Noncompliance with Order. - The mere fact that a defendant ordered to pay a certain sum monthly for the necessary subsistence of his wife and child has a right to move at any time for modification of the order does not support the
                            conclusion that defendant's failure to comply with the order is willful. Smithwick v. Smithwick, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 503</cite>, 11 S.E.2d 455 (1940).

                        <p>
                            Findings Required to Support Judgment for Contempt. - In contempt proceedings for willful failure to comply with an order of court, it is required that the court find facts supporting the conclusion of willfulness, and findings of fact that defendant
                            had been ordered to pay a certain sum monthly for the necessary subsistence of his wife and child, and that defendant had failed to comply with the order, without findings as to the property possessed by defendant or his earning
                            capacity, will not support a judgment attaching defendant for contempt. Smithwick v. Smithwick, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 503</cite>, 11 S.E.2d 455 (1940).

                            Facts Found in Contempt Proceedings Not Reviewable Except upon Their Sufficiency. - In proceedings for contempt, the facts found by the judge are not reviewable except for the purpose of passing upon their sufficiency to warrant the judgment. Cox v. Cox,
                            <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                            Imprisonment Erroneous. - Where the trial judge found that the party was a healthy and able-bodied man for his age, and further found that he could pay at least a portion of the alimony, it was error to imprison him until he should pay the whole amount.

         Enforcement of Duty of Support.
        </b> - The law imposes a continuing legal duty upon a husband (supporting spouse) to support his wife (dependent spouse). Such duty is enforceable in a variety of ways: through criminal sanctions imposed for willful
                            abandonment coupled with nonsupport, and through civil decrees granting alimony, alimony pendente lite, or alimony without divorce on the basis of misconduct or failure to support. Gray v. Snyder, 704 F.2d 709 (4th Cir. 1983).

                            <b>
         Contractual Limitation on Duty of Support.
        </b> - Duty of support is considered to be so fraught with a public interest that any contractual undertaking between a husband and wife living together and not contemplating imminent separation which purports to quantify
                            or limit the duty is, under North Carolina law, void as against public policy. Gray v. Snyder, 704 F.2d 709 (4th Cir. 1983).

                        <p>
                            Jurisdiction over Alimony Proceedings. - The district court has jurisdiction over alimony proceedings and, indeed, the legislature has decreed that it is the only "proper" division for such a proceeding. Peoples v. Peoples,

                            Procedure Where Grounds for Alimony Are Asserted Simultaneously as Grounds for Divorce. - While it is true that the determination of dependency properly rests with the trial judge, and not with the jury, where the grounds asserted for alimony are asserted
                            simultaneously as grounds for divorce, the right to alimony depends on the legal entitlement to divorce, regardless of financial dependency. The ordinary and correct procedure in such cases, therefore, is to allow the jury
                            to render its verdict on the "fault" issues of divorce, and then and only then to move to a bench hearing on dependency and the proper amount, if any, of alimony. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite>                            405, 322 S.E.2d 427 (1984).

                            The term "application," as used in this section, means a motion in the cause, the procedure for which is governed by the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>.

                        <p>
                            The legislature intended the word "application," as used in subsections (b) and (d) of this section and in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 7(b)(1),

                            Application for Alimony or Alimony Pendente Lite in Divorce Action Need Not Be Contained in Pleadings. - Nothing in this section indicates that an application for either alimony or alimony pendente lite must be contained in the pleadings or an amendment
                            thereto in an action for absolute divorce. McCarley v. McCarley, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 109</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 490 (1976).

                            Burden on Applicant for Alimony. - This section looks first to the ability of the spouses to maintain the standard of living to which they have become accustomed during the last years of the marriage. The burden on the applicant for alimony is to show
                            the accustomed standard of living and lack of means to maintain that standard. Only then does the ability of the other spouse to pay become significant. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite>                            405, 322 S.E.2d 427 (1984).

                            Application Properly Served on Defendant's Attorney. - Where motion for alimony did not specify a date for a hearing, but was served, by depositing it in the mail, properly addressed to defendant's attorney, at least five days before an already scheduled
                            hearing, plaintiff properly proceeded to apply for alimony. McCarley v. McCarley, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 109</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 490 (1976).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Counterclaims. - The statutes dealing specifically with divorce actions do not prescribe a procedure for counterclaims different from that prescribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                            Rule 13(a). Gardner v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 172</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 399 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is no conflict between the statutes dealing with procedure in divorce actions and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 13(a).

                            Rule 13(a) superimposes an additional characteristic on certain kinds of counterclaims. Gardner v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 172</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 399 (1978).

                            Improper venue, in an action for alimony pendente lite and alimony without divorce, is subject to attack under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 12(b)(3).

                            Court Lacked Authority to Rule While Change of Venue Motion Was Pending. - When supporting spouse in apt time made a proper motion for change of venue under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                            Rule 12(b)(3), it became a matter of right, and the district court was without authority to proceed further in the cause until the motion to remove had been determined. Since the court lacked authority to make any ruling on
                            the merits while the motion to change venue was pending, it was error to enter an order granting alimony pendente lite and counsel fees. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 183 S.E.2d 278 (1971).

                            "Supporting Spouse" Defined. - A "supporting spouse" is a spouse, whether husband or wife, upon whom the other spouse is actually substantially dependent or from whom such other spouse is substantially in need of maintenance and support. A spouse meets
                            the definition if he or she qualifies under either test, which essentially is the same as that applied for "dependent spouse." The primary issue is not the supporting spouse's ability to pay, but whether the spouse seeking
                            alimony is a dependent spouse. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 322 S.E.2d 427 (1984).

                            Determination of what constitutes a "dependent spouse" and what constitutes a "supporting spouse" requires an application of principles of statutory law to facts and therefore involves mixed questions of law and fact. Peoples v. Peoples,

                            Accustomed Standard of Living Determinative. - It is not necessary that a spouse be reduced to penury to be considered dependent; the accustomed standard of living is the proper measure.

                            Vacation of Consent Judgments Without Making Specific Findings Held Error. - While a consent order for alimony or alimony pendente lite may be modified or vacated at any time upon motion and a showing of changed circumstances, where defendant husband
                            offered some evidence of changed circumstances but the trial court failed to comply with the statutory mandate as to the making of specific findings, and erroneously ruled that consent judgments were invalid for failure of
                            the court to make a finding of dependency, the cause would be remanded for a de novo hearing. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 245 S.E.2d 94 (1978).

                            Judgment as Judicial Separation for Purpose of G.S. 50-6. - A judgment in an action instituted under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite> decreeing that the husband had willfully
                            abandoned the wife and awarding her support and maintenance constituted a judicial separation which, two years (now one year) thereafter, would permit the husband to obtain an absolute divorce. Rouse v. Rouse, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 520</cite>,

                            outweigh its disadvantages. Crutchley v. Crutchley, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 518</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 793 (1982).

                            Determining Proper Amount of Counsel Fees. - The trial court is under an obligation to conduct a broad inquiry in making its determination of the proper amount of counsel fees which are to be awarded a dependent spouse as litigant, considering as relevant
                            factors the nature and worth of the services rendered, the magnitude of the task imposed upon counsel, and reasonable consideration for the parties' respective conditions and financial circumstances. Clark v. Clark,

                        <p>
                            It would be contrary to what the court perceives to be the intent of the legislature to require a dependent spouse to meet the expenses of litigation through the unreasonable depletion of her separate estate where her separate estate is considerably smaller
                            than that of the supporting spouse. Clark v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 123</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 58 (1980).

                            Findings of Fact Lacking. - Trial court erred in denying a wife's request for postseparation support because the court made no factual findings supporting the court's reasons.

                            Appellate Review. - The granting or denial of a motion for temporary alimony (pendente lite) is within the discretion of the trial judge and as such is normally not reviewable on appeal. However, the same may not be said about a dismissal of an action
                            for alimony without divorce. Holcomb v. Holcomb, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 172 S.E.2d 212 (1970).

                            Action for Alimony Not Abated by Prior Action of Husband for Absolute Divorce. - The prior institution of an action by the husband for an absolute divorce does not abate the wife's subsequent action for alimony without divorce, nor deprive the court of
                            power to award her alimony and counsel fees pendente lite therein. Reece v. Reece, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 321</cite>, 56 S.E.2d 641 (1949).

                            Action for Alimony Barred by Verdict in Divorce Action. - The doctrine of res judicata applies to divorce actions as well as other civil cases, and hence the fact that the wife has the alternate remedy of independent action or a cross-action to secure
                            alimony without divorce does not authorize her to bring an independent action based upon abandonment when the issue of abandonment has theretofore been determined adversely to her by verdict of the jury in the husband's action

                            for the plaintiff and the minor child of the marriage and for such other relief as may be just and proper, without prayer for divorce, the cause is an action for alimony without divorce. Brooks v. Brooks,

                            absolute or from bed and board, without disturbing the right of the wife to bring an independent action under the statute for alimony without divorce, the alternative procedure being permissive but not mandatory. Beeson v.

                            Notice of Intended Cross-Action Does Not Preclude Taking of Voluntary Nonsuit. - Plaintiff, in an action for absolute divorce, is entitled as a matter of right to take a voluntary nonsuit upon paying costs and alimony pendente lite to the date of motion,
                            notwithstanding he has had notice of defendant's intention to file a cross-action for alimony without divorce, and where the nonsuit has been taken, no action is pending in which defendant may amend her answer to assert such
                            cross-action. Scott v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 642</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 478 (1963).

                            Requirements of Complaint. - The complaint in an action for alimony without divorce must allege facts sufficient to constitute a good cause of action under the provision of the statute for the court to allow wife (dependent spouse) from the estate or
                            earnings of her husband (supporting spouse) a reasonable support and counsel fees, and when the wife alleges only that she has left her husband because he failed to fulfill his promise to supply certain conveniences, this is
                            insufficient. McManus v. McManus, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 740</cite>, 133 S.E. 9 (1926).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The plaintiff, in an action for alimony without divorce on the ground of abandonment, is not required to allege the acts and conduct relied upon as the basis of the action with that degree of particularity as is required when the cause of action is based
                            on such indignities to the person of plaintiff as to render her condition intolerable and life burdensome. Sguros v. Sguros, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 408</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 79 (1960).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In an action for alimony without divorce, allegations that the husband had been abusive and violent toward plaintiff and that she had been made to fear for her safety were insufficient, it being necessary that plaintiff allege specific acts of misconduct
                            on the part of the husband so that the court could determine whether his conduct was in fact such as constituted cause for divorce from bed and board, and that plaintiff also specify what, if anything, she did or said at the
                            time, in order that the court could determine whether she provoked the difficulty. Ollis v. Ollis, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 709</cite>, 86 S.E.2d 420 (1955).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The essential elements required to be alleged in an action for alimony without divorce are (1) separation of the husband (supporting spouse) from the wife (dependent spouse), and (2) his failure to provide her with necessary subsistence according to his
                            means and condition in life. Trull v. Trull, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 196</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 225 (1948); Bowling v. Bowling, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 527</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 228 (1960).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In an action for alimony without divorce, it suffices for wife (dependent spouse) to allege and prove (1) the existence of a valid marriage between the parties, and (2) that the husband (supporting spouse) has separated himself from the wife and failed
                            to provide her (and the children of the marriage) with necessary subsistence according to his means, or, instead of the latter, that the husband is a drunkard or spendthrift. Caddell v. Caddell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 686</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 923 (1953).

                        <p>
                            A wife's complaint states a cause of action for alimony without divorce under the statute if it alleges separation without providing subsistence, or alleges that the husband (supporting spouse) is a drunkard or spendthrift or is guilty of any misconduct
                            or acts that would be or constitute cause for divorce either absolute or from bed and board. Thurston v. Thurston, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 663</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 852 (1962).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To state a cause of action for alimony without divorce it is necessary to allege: (1) the marriage, (2) the separation of the husband (supporting spouse) from the wife (dependent spouse) and his failure to provide the wife and children of the marriage
                            reasonable subsistence, i.e., abandonment, or some conduct on the part of the husband constituting cause for divorce, either absolute or from bed and board, and (3) want of provocation on the part of the wife. Murphy v. Murphy,
                            <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 95</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 148 (1964).

                            Allegation That Acts of Husband Were Without Provocation - In General. - An allegation in an action for alimony without divorce that the separation of defendant from plaintiff wife was without fault or misconduct on her part was a sufficient allegation
                            that husband's acts were without provocation on her part. Trull v. Trull, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 196</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 225 (1948).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In an action for alimony without divorce, as in an action for divorce a mensa et thoro by the wife (dependent spouse), she must not only set out with some particularity the acts of cruelty upon the part of the husband (supporting spouse), but she must
                            also aver, and consequently offer proof, that such acts were without adequate provocation on her part. The omission of such allegations is fatal. Howell v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 62</cite>,
                            25 S.E.2d 169 (1943); Best v. Best, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 9</cite>, 44 S.E.2d 214 (1947); Ollis v. Ollis, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 709</cite>, 86 S.E.2d 420 (1955).

                        <p>
                            In an action by the wife (dependent spouse) for alimony without divorce on the ground of mistreatment constituting constructive abandonment, the absence of an allegation that defendant's misconduct was without adequate provocation is fatal. Barker v.
                            Barker, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 495</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 360 (1950).

                            Same - Where Adultery Is Charged. - Where a complaint alleges adultery and also sets forth acts of misconduct constituting a basis for divorce from bed and board, the failure of the complaint to allege that the misconduct was without adequate provocation
                            is not fatal, since such allegation is not necessary in an action for absolute divorce on the ground of adultery, and this ground, independently, is sufficient to sustain the action for alimony without divorce. Brooks v. Brooks,
                            <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 280</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 909 (1946).

                            Allegations Held Sufficient. - Allegations in an action for alimony without divorce to the effect that defendant constantly mistreated plaintiff and offered such indignities to her person as to endanger her health and safety and forced her to separate
                            herself from defendant, that defendant drank excessively and failed to provide for her support, and that plaintiff had at all times been a dutiful wife, were sufficient to state a cause of action for alimony without divorce,
                            and defendant's demurrer thereto was properly overruled. Bateman v. Bateman, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 659</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 909 (1950).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Allegation that defendant had become an habitual drunkard constituted a ground for divorce from bed and board, and hence was sufficient to support an action for alimony without divorce even though other insufficient allegations also appeared in the complaint.

                            Rule 38(b), since this section changes the procedure to be followed in actions for alimony without divorce from the divorce procedure set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-10" target="_self">G.S. 50-10</a></cite>                            to the procedure applicable to other civil actions.

                            Judge May Not Determine Facts upon Evidence Introduced at Another Trial. - The trial judge may not pass upon the issuable facts in proceedings for alimony without divorce upon evidence introduced before him theretofore upon a trial of the husband for
                            criminal abandonment, etc., of which he was acquitted, when the witnesses are present and ready to testify. Crews v. Crews, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 168</cite>, 95 S.E. 149 (1918), distinguishing

                            The only material facts at issue in the action for alimony without divorce are the questions of the existence of the marriage relation and whether the husband abandoned the wife. Skittletharpe v. Skittletharpe, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 72</cite>,

                            Finding of Facts by Judge. - In a wife's application for alimony without divorce, it was not required by former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite> that the judge hearing the matter
                            should find the facts as a basis for his judgment, as was required in proceedings for alimony pendente lite under former G.S. 50-15, although it was necessary that wife allege sufficient facts to constitute a good cause of
                            action thereunder. Price v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 640</cite>, 125 S.E. 264 (1924); Vincent v. Vincent, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 492</cite>, 137 S.E. 426 (1927).

                            Attack on Consent Judgment by Infant's Guardians. - Where the court in proceedings for alimony without divorce approves a consent judgment providing for the support and subsistence of the defendant's wife and child, the validity of such consent judgment
                            may be later attacked by the child's authorized guardians on the ground of irregularity and that it is not binding on the minor. In re Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 276</cite>, 173 S.E.

                            But a resident judge holding court in another district cannot hear a motion to reduce alimony pendente lite in a suit pending in the district in which he resides. Moore v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 371</cite>, 42

                            Effect of Suit for Divorce Instituted After Suit for Alimony. - Where, after the wife instituted a suit for alimony without divorce, in which action the question of the custody of the minor child of the marriage was not raised, the husband instituted
                            suit for absolute divorce, it was held that the 1953 amendment to former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite> did not affect the jurisdictional power of
                            the court to award subsistence for the mother and child pendente lite in her action. Barnwell v. Barnwell, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 565</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 916 (1955).

                        <p>
                            Necessity for Notice to Defendant. - An order entered in action for alimony without divorce requiring defendant to pay subsistence and counsel fees pendente lite is void when the order is entered without notice to defendant. Barnwell v. Barnwell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 565</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 916 (1955).

                            An order allowing alimony pendente lite without notice is void. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581 (1962).

                        <p>
                            The provision in former G.S. 50-15 requiring five days' notice applied only when the motion was heard out of term; and parties were fixed with notice of all motions or orders made during the term of the court. Coor v. Smith,
                            <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 430</cite>, 11 S.E. 1089 (1890); Zimmerman v. Zimmerman, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 432</cite>, 18 S.E. 334 (1893); Jones v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 279</cite>, 91 S.E. 960 (1917).

                            An order of court continuing the motion for alimony to a future term of court made in the presence of counsel for both parties was sufficient notice, under former G.S. 50-15, of such motion. Lea v. Lea, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 603</cite>,
                            10 S.E. 488 (1889).

                        <p>
                            When Notice Dispensed with. - An affidavit of the wife that husband had left the State the day after the filing of the complaint and that she had good reason to believe that he had left to defeat her claim for alimony, having been selling his property
                            for several months with that purpose in view, dispensed with the necessity of notice. Barker v. Barker, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 316</cite>, 48 S.E. 733 (1904).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the supporting spouse abandons the dependent spouse and leaves the State, notice of hearing on motion for alimony pendente lite is not required, nor is service on the supporting spouse's counsel of record required. Fungaroli v. Fungaroli,
                            <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 252 S.E.2d 849 (1979), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, 446 U.S. 930, 100 S. Ct. 2144, 64 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1980).

                        <p>
                            Specification of Time of Hearing. - The fact that a notice of a motion for alimony pendente lite, duly served upon the defendant, did not specify the time of hearing, did not invalidate the order allowing the same, it having been heard at a time of court
                            at which the cause stood regularly for trial. Zimmerman v. Zimmerman, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 432</cite>, 18 S.E. 334 (1893).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Whether the wife is entitled to alimony pendente lite is a question of law, upon the facts found, and is reviewable on appeal by either party. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 109</cite> (1883); Moore v. Moore,
                            <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 333</cite>, 41 S.E. 943 (1902); Barker v. Barker, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 316</cite>, 48 S.E. 733 (1904).

                        <p>
                            Jury Trial Not Required. - In respect of allowances for alimony and counsel fees pendente lite, the allowances pendente lite form no part of the ultimate relief sought and do not affect the final rights of the parties, and the power of the judge to make
                            them is constitutionally exercised without the intervention of the jury. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 120</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 306 (1967).
                        </p>

                            Pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, a supporting spouse is not entitled to a jury trial on the matter of alimony pendente lite. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Power of Court to Require Disclosure of Information. - The court has jurisdiction of the parties and has plenary power and authority to require the disclosure of any information which is within their knowledge or is available to them bearing upon a temporary
                            allowance. It is not necessary that the parties agree as to what the husband's income is. The findings of the court will not be disturbed if based on competent evidence. Harrell v. Harrell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 96</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 220 (1961).

                        <p>
                            Right of Defendant to Offer Evidence. - Where it affirmatively appeared that defendant was not permitted to offer evidence which was pertinent to the allegations of the complaint, exception thereto would be sustained. Parker v. Parker,
                            <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 176</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 174 (1964).

                        <p>
                            Discretion of Judge as to Form of Evidence. - The words "may be heard in or out of term, orally or upon affidavit, or either or both" in former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>                            gave the judge hearing the motion for alimony pendente lite the discretion to decide in what form he should receive the evidence in his efforts to ascertain the truth. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 140</cite>,
                            153 S.E.2d 854 (1967).

                        <p>
                            Judge Must Pass on Truth or Falsity of Evidence. - When the issue has been raised as to whether the husband has separated himself from the wife, it is not sufficient that the judge merely examine the evidence or testimony to see whether there is any evidence
                            to support plaintiff's charges or allegations which would operate as a prima facie showing. He must, by application of his sound judgment, pass upon its truth or falsity and find according to his conviction. Deal v. Deal,
                            <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 489</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 24 (1963).

                        <p>
                            And Must Make Findings of Fact. - The provision of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 52(a)(2) that the trial judge is not required to make findings
                            of fact unless requested to do so by a party does not abrogate the specific requirement of subsection (f) of this section that the trial judge shall make findings of fact upon an application for alimony pendente lite, since
                            the Rules of Civil Procedure are of general application and do not abrogate the requirements of a statute of more specificity. Hatcher v. Hatcher, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 562, 173 S.E.2d 33 (1970).

                            While the precise factual findings which must be made under subsection (f) of this section will vary depending upon the pleadings, evidence and circumstances of each case, the trial judge must make sufficient findings of the controverted material facts
                            at issue to show that the award of alimony pendente lite is justified and appropriate. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420 (1971); Presson v. Presson,

                            But Detailed Findings Are Not Required. - In making findings of fact under subsection (f) of this section, it is not necessary that the trial judge make detailed findings as to each allegation and evidentiary fact presented. It is only necessary that
                            he find the ultimate facts sufficient to establish that the dependent spouse is entitled to an award of alimony pendente lite under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.3ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.3(a)</a></cite>.

                            Findings Must Show That Award Is Justified. - The Court of Appeals does not interpret subsection (f) of this section to require the trial judge to make findings as to each allegation and evidentiary fact presented. However, it is necessary for the trial
                            judge to make findings from which it can be determined, upon appellate review, that an award of alimony pendente lite is justified and appropriate in the case. Hatcher v.

                            Finding of Fact as Narrative Statement of Ultimate Fact. - A finding of fact in an alimony pendente lite matter is a narrative statement by the trial judge of the ultimate fact at issue and need not include the evidentiary or subsidiary facts required
                            to prove the ultimate facts. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971); Sprinkle v. Sprinkle, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 175, 193 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            Findings that the defendant left the home on July 21, 1970, had abandoned the plaintiff, and had failed to provide adequate support for her were a narrative statement of some of the ultimate facts at issue, and were not conclusions. Peoples v. Peoples,
                            <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ultimate facts at issue in proceedings often differ, and thus a necessary finding of facts in one case may not be necessary in another case. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d
                            138 (1971).

                        <p>
                            The findings of fact in any given case should be "tailor-made" to settle the matters at issue between the parties. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971).

                            Present Requirement for Findings of Fact Is Departure from Previous Practice. - The present statutory requirement for findings of fact by the trial judge in pendente lite awards of alimony is a departure from the practice as it existed prior to October
                            1, 1967. Hatcher v. Hatcher, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 562, 173 S.E.2d 33 (1970); Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The requirement of subsection (f) of this section that facts be found to support an award of alimony is a new one imposed by Session Laws 1967, c. 1153, s. 2. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286,
                            183 S.E.2d 420 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The statutory requirement for findings of fact changes the prior rule that no findings of fact were necessary in alimony pendente lite matters unless adultery was charged against the wife. Rickert v. Rickert, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 373</cite>,
                            193 S.E.2d 79 (1972).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The distinction between the "finding of facts" and the "stating of conclusions" by the trial judge after he has heard the evidence in an alimony pendente lite matter is somewhat analogous to the distinction between a witness testifying as to a "fact"
                            and stating his "opinion." Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Facts are the basis for conclusions, and to call a "conclusion" a "finding of fact" does not make it one. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Facts found in an alimony pendente lite case must be determinative of all questions at issue. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138 (1971); Sprinkle v. Sprinkle, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite>                            175, 193 S.E.2d 468 (1972).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A failure to make a proper finding of fact in a matter at issue will result in prejudicial error, especially where the evidence is conflicting. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 179 S.E.2d 138
                            (1971); Sprinkle v. Sprinkle, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 175, 193 S.E.2d 468 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Award of permanent alimony ordinarily terminates an order for subsistence pendente lite or counsel fees. Rickert v. Rickert, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 373</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 79 (1972); Clark v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 123</cite>,

                            Where a pendente lite order by its express language was effective only "pending the trial of this action," it was in all respects superseded by the rendition of the final judgment. Clarke v. Clarke, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite>                            249, 267 S.E.2d 361 (1980).

                            Jurisdiction Under Long-Arm Statute. - This section provides only that an alimony order entered by a court of another jurisdiction may be modified by a court of this State "upon gaining jurisdiction over the person of both parties"; therefore, statutory
                            jurisdiction arises, if at all, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIIAa6As1-75.4" target="_blank">G.S. 1-75.4</a></cite>, the North Carolina "long-arm" statute. Schofield
                            v. Schofield, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 338 S.E.2d 132 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Money payments are "things of value" within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIIAa6As1-75.4" target="_blank">G.S. 1-75.4(5)</a></cite>d, the long-arm statute; thus, in an action brought
                            by resident husband against nonresident wife to have alimony obligation reduced or terminated, statutory jurisdiction existed. However, under the circumstances, defendant did not have sufficient minimum contacts with North
                            Carolina and her motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was improperly denied. Schofield v. Schofield, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 338 S.E.2d 132 (1986).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Alimony Award Held Fair to Both Wife and Husband. - Because a husband's estate was substantially larger than a wife's estate, it would have been unfair to require the wife to further deplete her estate while allowing the husband to maintain his; because
                            a modified alimony award required both parties to deplete their estates to meet their living expenses, award was fair to both parties. Swain v. Swain, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 795,
                            635 S.E.2d 504 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 437</cite>, 649 S.E.2d 897 (2007).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An order for payment of alimony is not a final judgment, since it may be modified upon application of either party; thus, an action for alimony would continue to be "pending" in the court of proper jurisdiction, which is now the district court. Peoples
                            v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 174 S.E.2d 2 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A final judgment could not be entered under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>, as the necessity of such provisions for the wife and children would cease if the parties resumed
                            the marriage relation, and could not properly be continued if the husband procured a divorce for the fault of the wife. Skittletharpe v. Skittletharpe, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 72</cite>, 40 S.E. 851 (1902); Hooper v.
                            Hooper, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 1</cite>, 80 S.E. 64 (1913); Crews v. Crews, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 168</cite>, 95 S.E. 149 (1918).

                        <p>
                            An order entered under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16" target="_self">G.S. 50-16</a></cite> was not a final determination and did not affect the final rights of the parties. Deal v. Deal, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 489</cite>,
                            131 S.E.2d 24 (1963).

                        <p>
                            And the allowance is subject to modification from time to time. Harrell v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 96</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 220 (1961).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The court may reopen and amend prior orders awarding subsistence to wife and children. Wright v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 693</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 555 (1940).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where, within the exercise of his sound discretion, the judge having jurisdiction has allowed the wife a reasonable subsistence, attorneys' fees, etc., in her proceedings for alimony without divorce, the order of allowance may be thereafter modified or
                            vacated as the statute provides upon application to the proper jurisdiction for the circumstances to be inquired into and the merits of the case determined. Anderson v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 139</cite>,
                            110 S.E. 863 (1922).

                        <p>
                            Modification of Alimony Improper Where Motion Only Sought Modification of Child Support. - Where, the only motion before the trial court was one for modification of child support, not alimony, and at no point in the proceedings did either party move for
                            modification of the alimony payments, order modifying alimony agreement would be reversed. Van Nynatten v. Van Nynatten, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 438 S.E.2d 417 (1993).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Upon a Showing of Changed Conditions. - An order for support is not final, and may be modified or set aside on a showing of changed conditions. Byers v. Byers, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 85</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 466 (1943).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An order for the payment of alimony is res judicata between the parties, but is not a final judgment, since the court has the power, upon application of either party, to modify the order for changed conditions of the parties. Barber v. Barber,
                            <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 422</cite>, 8 S.E.2d 204 (1940).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An award of subsistence for defendant and the children born of the marriage, decreed by a court in conjunction with a divorce a mensa et thoro, before the commencement of a proceeding by the wife for a divorce a vincula under the provisions of
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-6" target="_self">G.S. 50-6</a></cite>, which she obtained, can be increased in amount by the court in its discretion, on her motion in the action when and where subsistence was awarded,
                            when changed circumstances of the parties reasonably require it. Rayfield v. Rayfield, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 691</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 399 (1955).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A court may vacate or modify its prior award of either permanent or temporary alimony upon a showing of changed circumstances. Roberts v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 295, 248 S.E.2d 85 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although there is no requirement that the alimony be modified, upon a showing of changed circumstance, the trial court should consider, in its discretion, whether to modify the original decree of alimony. Cunningham v. Cunningham,
                            <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 771, 468 S.E.2d 466 (1996), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 430</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 403 (1997).

                        <p>
                            Changed Circumstances Relating to Factors in Original Determination of Alimony. - Only those changed circumstances that relate to the factors used in the original determination of the amount of alimony awarded are relevant to a request for modification.
                            Kowalick v. Kowalick, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 781, 501 S.E.2d 671 (1998).

                        <p>
                            Modification Referable to Date Petition Filed. - Orders which modify alimony or support payments effective as of the date of the petition, or subsequent thereto, but prior to the date of the order of modification, are not subject to the criticism that
                            they have retroactive effect which destroys vested rights. This is true because the modification and the whole proceeding in which it is made are referable to the date of the filing of the petition and any change effective
                            as of that date cannot be said to be retroactive. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 140</cite>, 435 S.E.2d 766 (1993).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in modifying the husband's alimony obligation back to the date of his motion to modify alimony based upon depletion of his estate because it correctly considered the comparison of the estates of the parties, nor did it abuse its
                            discretion by basing the alimony award on a combination of the husband's estate and his current income recognizing that his estate would be depleted to maintain the alimony obligation during his time of unemployment, even in
                            the absence of bad faith or imputation of income for purposes of alimony. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 821 S.E.2d 210 (2018).

                            Improper Finding That Wife Had Cohabited - Trial court erred in finding that a husband did not breach a separation agreement; trial court improperly found that the wife had cohabited pursuant to the terms of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.9ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.9(b)</a></cite>,
                            because the trial court failed to make adequate findings of fact as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 52(a)(1); therefore, the trial court
                            erred in finding that the husband was no longer obligated to pay alimony. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 588 S.E.2d 1 (2003).

                            Findings on Subjective Intent. - Trial court did not err by failing to make findings regarding the subjective intent of a former wife and the man she was dating because the trial court's findings addressing the "objective evidence" were sufficient to
                            support the conclusion that cohabitation did not occur, Smallwood v. Smallwood, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 742 S.E.2d 814 (2013).

                            Effect on Alimony of Contract Regarding Cohabitation. - Although the statute provides for termination of court-ordered alimony upon cohabitation by the dependent spouse, parties are free to enter into a contract providing otherwise. Bradshaw v. Bradshaw,

                            Support Payments Not Part of Integrated Agreement. - The opinion in Walters v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 381</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 338 (1983) did not change the law in North Carolina that property settlement provisions
                            of a separation agreement included in a consent decree are beyond the power of the judge to modify without the consent of both parties, nor did it change the law in North Carolina which prohibits the modification of support
                            provisions of an integrated property settlement agreement; however, since support payments not part of an integrated agreement are modifiable by law, Walters would allow such support provisions to be modified if included in
                            a court-ordered decree at the request of the parties. Hayes v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 394 S.E.2d 675 (1990).

                            But a New Order for Alimony After Final Divorce Is Not Authorized. - Although an order granting alimony may be modified, when a party has secured an absolute divorce, it is beyond the power of the court thereafter to enter a new order for alimony. Baugh

                            Either Party May Apply for Modification of Award of Alimony Pendente Lite. - The amounts allowed for reasonable subsistence and counsel fees upon application for alimony pendente lite are determined by the trial court in its discretion and are not reviewable,
                            although either party may apply for a modification before trial. Tiedemann v. Tiedemann, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 682</cite>, 169 S.E. 422 (1933).

                            Change of Dependent Spouse Status Not Contemplated. - Although dependent spouse status is not properly reconsidered on a motion for modification and a change in circumstances could result in a reduction of alimony to zero, such modification does not result
                            in the loss of dependent spouse status. Kowalick v. Kowalick, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 781, 501 S.E.2d 671 (1998).

                            Contempt Hearing May Not Be Transformed to Modification Hearing Without Notice. - The court, on its own motion and without notice to plaintiff, cannot transform a hearing for defendant to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for willful failure

                            Court order requiring defendant to secure payment of temporary alimony by means of a deed of trust did not give plaintiff fixed or permanent interest as cestui que trust, or any right to the entire proceeds of foreclosure sale under deed of trust; the
                            order simply provided a means of securing payment of alimony, and the court was not required to find a change of circumstances as a basis for ordering the payment of a part of the proceeds of foreclosure sale to satisfy a judgment
                            lien against defendant or to pay the fee of defendant's attorney. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 448, 213 S.E.2d 427 (1975).

                            Showing Necessary to Obtain Attorneys' Fees. - To be entitled to attorney fees it must be shown that they were necessary to enable the dependent spouse to litigate on substantially even terms by making it possible for her to employ counsel. The dependent
                            spouse must be unable to defray the necessary expenses of the litigation. Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 177</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 840 (1982).

                            In order to obtain an award of counsel fees in a proceeding seeking a modification of alimony subsequent to divorce, the party seeking the fees must show: (1) That he or she is a dependent spouse; (2) that he or she is entitled to the relief demanded
                            based upon all the evidence; and (3) that he or she has insufficient means to defray the expenses of the proceeding. Cecil v. Cecil, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 328 S.E.2d 899

                            Award of Counsel Fees Held Proper. - The former husband, by his own action in seeking to terminate his obligation to make further payments to plaintiff, forced the plaintiff to incur expenses for attorneys' fees simply to preserve rights which were already
                            hers as result of a decree originally entered prior to the divorce. The trial court had authority, in its sound discretion, to order defendant to pay plaintiff's reasonable counsel fees. Shore v. Shore,

                            Award of Attorneys' Fees Held Improper. - Attorneys' fees can properly be awarded in custody and child support cases upon adequate findings that the moving party acted in good faith and has insufficient means to defray the expense of the suit; thus, in
                            an action for child support, custody and alimony, where the court found that plaintiff did not have sufficient income and assets with which to pay her attorney, but made no finding as to plaintiff's good faith in bringing the
                            action, the award of attorneys' fees could not stand. Voshell v. Voshell, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 315 S.E.2d 763 (1984).

                            New Motion After Failure of Original. - Where a motion to reduce alimony pendente lite has been disallowed, another motion for the same purpose should not be heard unless a different state of facts is shown and a receipt exhibited for a reasonable proportion
                            of the allowance made at the former hearing. Moore v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 371</cite>, 42 S.E. 822 (1902).

                            Appeal of order terminating dependent spouse's right to receive temporary alimony was not premature, as the question of plaintiff's continued entitlement to the previously ordered alimony pendente lite until such time as her prayer for permanent alimony
                            could be heard affected a "substantial right" of the dependent spouse. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 355 S.E.2d 525, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 511</cite>,

                            The trial court's failure to make any findings regarding plaintiff's reasonable current financial needs and expenses and the ratio of those needs and expenses to her income constituted error.

                            Evidentiary Hearing Required. - Where a separation agreement did not contain explicit, unequivocal provisions on integration or nonintegration, an evidentiary hearing was required to determine the intent of the parties regarding whether the agreement
                            was separable or integrated. Hayes v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 394 S.E.2d 675 (1990).

                            Termination of Consent Order for Alimony Justified. - Defendant husband was entitled to have his alimony payments terminated pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.9ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.9(b)</a></cite>,
                            as trial court order directing that he continue to pay alimony was a consent order rather than an order of specific performance of his and plaintiff wife's separation agreement, and thus, allowed for termination because parties
                            agreed that statutory grounds for termination of alimony, that plaintiff was cohabiting with another man, existed, regardless of the separation agreement provisions.

                            a substantial change of circumstances warranting a modification of alimony based upon: (1) the former husband's financial situation having improved so that he was then able to pay the former wife's entire monthly financial
                            shortfall; and (2) the wife's overall financial situation had, in fact, worsened. Pierce v. Pierce, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 655 S.E.2d 863 (2008).

                            conduct of either party. Stallings v. Stallings, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 244 S.E.2d 494, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 648</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 249 (1978); Britt

                            There is no statute that allows the court to modify an award of alimony solely because of post-marital fornication. Stallings v. Stallings, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 244 S.E.2d 494, cert. denied,

                            Any Considerable Change in Health or Financial Condition Warrants Change of Decree. - Any considerable change in the health or financial condition of the parties will warrant an application for change or modification of an alimony decree. Sayland v. Sayland,
                            <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 378</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 218 (1966); Crosby v. Crosby, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 235</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 77 (1967).

                        <p>
                            But payment of alimony may not be avoided merely because it has become burdensome, or because the husband has remarried and voluntarily assumed additional obligations. Sayland v. Sayland, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 378</cite>,
                            148 S.E.2d 218 (1966); Crosby v. Crosby, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 235</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 77 (1967).

                            Reduction in Husband's Salary or Income. - The fact that the husband's salary or income has been reduced substantially does not automatically entitle him to a reduction in alimony or maintenance. If the husband is able to make the payments as originally
                            ordered, notwithstanding the reduction in his income, and the other facts of the case make it proper to continue the payments, the court may refuse to modify the decree.

                            Increase in Wife's Needs or Decrease in Estate. - An increase in the wife's needs, or a decrease in her separate estate, may warrant an increase in alimony. Sayland v. Sayland, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 378</cite>, 148
                            S.E.2d 218 (1966).

                            On a motion to modify or terminate an order of alimony, it is appropriate for the trial court to consider whether the dependent spouse's financial need, that is, dependency, as it relates to the factors in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.5" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.5</a></cite>,
                            has changed. Cunningham v. Cunningham, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 430</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 403 (1997).

                        <p>
                            Trial court could determine that the wife's circumstances had changed substantially when the wife and husband's minor child turned 18-years-old, and grant the wife's motion for an increase in alimony, because the original alimony award attributed some
                            expenses to the minor child, and the wife was forced to take on those expenses when the minor child turned 18-years-old. At the same time, the trial court could determine that the husband was not entitled to decrease the husband's
                            alimony payment, as the husband was still able to make the original alimony payments ordered despite a decrease in income. Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 656 S.E.2d

                            In a former wife's action to modify alimony and child support under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.9" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.9</a></cite> and G.S.50-16.3A(b), her affidavit demonstrating that her total reasonable
                            monthly expenses had increased 24 percent since the prior order, to $7,474 per month, was itself sufficient evidence of the change in circumstances, without requiring additional supporting evidence. Parsons v. Parsons,

                            Decrease in Wife's Needs. - A decrease in the wife's needs is a change in condition which may be properly considered in passing upon a husband's motion to reduce her allowance. Sayland v. Sayland, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 378</cite>,

                            Acquisition of Property or Increase in Its Value. - The fact that the wife has acquired a substantial amount of property, or that her property has increased in value, after entry of a decree for alimony or maintenance, is an important consideration in
                            determining whether and to what extent the decree should be modified. Sayland v. Sayland, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 378</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 218 (1966).

                            Effect of Change in Income. - A modification should be founded upon a change in the overall circumstances of the parties. A change in income alone says nothing about the total circumstances of a party. The significant inquiry is how that change in income
                            affects a supporting spouse's ability to pay or a dependent spouse's need for support. Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 646, 280 S.E.2d 182 (1981), rev'd on other grounds,

                            Increase in wife's income alone did not warrant the modification of the original alimony order that reduced the husband's monthly alimony payments to $0. Pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.9ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.9(a)</a></cite>,
                            the trial court was obligated to make findings of fact showing changes in circumstances regarding the wife's reasonable current needs and the husband's ability to pay.

                            Failure to Exercise Capacity to Earn. - A court may refuse to modify a support and/or alimony award on the grounds that the husband has failed to exercise his reasonable capacity to earn because of a disregard of his marital and parental obligations to
                            provide reasonable support for his wife and minor child. Wachacha v. Wachacha, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 248 S.E.2d 375 (1978).

                        <p>
                            The determination that a husband's change in circumstances has been voluntarily effected by him in disregard of his marital and parental obligations justifying imposition of the earnings capacity rule is a conclusion of law based on the factual findings
                            in the particular case. Wachacha v. Wachacha, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 248 S.E.2d 375 (1978).

                            Father was not entitled to reduction in child and post-separation support payments under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.9" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.9</a></cite>                            despite being fired from job; evidence indicated that the father's unemployment was voluntary and that the father disregarded marital and parental obligations, as the father was fired for engaging in several incidents of intentional
                            misconduct. Wolf v. Wolf, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 566 S.E.2d 516 (2002).

                            Change Must Be Substantial. - Not any change of circumstances will be sufficient to order modification of an alimony award; rather, the phrase is used as a term of art to mean a substantial change in conditions, upon which the moving party bears the burden
                            of proving that the present award is either inadequate or unduly burdensome. Britt v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 463, 271 S.E.2d 921 (1980).

                        <p>
                            The change in circumstances must be substantial, with a final decision based on a comparison of the facts existing at the time of the original order and the time when the modification is sought. Broughton v. Broughton,

                            Determining Whether Substantial Change Occurred. - The present overall circumstances of the parties must be compared with the circumstances existing at the time of the original award in order to determine if there has been a substantial change. Britt

                            Sufficiency of Allegations. - Allegations in a motion for modification to the effect that the then-current alimony payments were inadequate were sufficient to withstand defendant's motion to dismiss. Specific allegations as to the basis of such inadequacy
                            were not required. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 246 S.E.2d 591 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698 (1979).

                            Plaintiff's allegation in a motion for increased support that the payments she was receiving were totally inadequate under current circumstances was sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,

                            Fact Issues Remained as to Cohabitation. - There were fact issues as to whether a wife had cohabitated under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.9ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.9(b)</a></cite> as the wife's alleged paramour
                            admitted that he spent the night at wife's house several times, that he and the wife had driven each other's vehicles, and that he had moved furniture into the wife's house; a private investigator observed that the paramour
                            had spent at least 11 consecutive nights with the wife, that the paramour had walked the wife's dog, parked in the wife's garage, carried groceries into the wife's house, and let workmen into and out of the wife's house, and
                            that the paramour's house appeared uninhabited. Bird v. Bird, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 123, 668 S.E.2d 39 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 774</cite>, 688 S.E.2d 420 (2010).

                            Cohabitation Not Found. - Trial court did not err in determining a former wife and the man she was dating were not cohabiting because while the former wife and the man had engaged in some domestic activities, there was no assumption of marital rights
                            and duties extending beyond those found in an intimate friendship; the former husband's alimony obligation was $4,000 per month. Smallwood v. Smallwood, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite>                            319, 742 S.E.2d 814 (2013).

                        <p>
                            Former wife did not engage in cohabitation because, while the former wife had an habitual and monogamous relationship with another man that benefitted the former wife economically, the former wife and the other man did not voluntarily and mutually assume
                            those marital rights, duties, and obligations usually manifested by married people, as (1) the former wife and other man kept separate residences, (2) the other man kept no clothes or personal items at the former wife's home,
                            (3) the former wife and other man did not tell anyone the former wife and other man were married, (4) the former wife repaid the other man for financial help, and (5) the former wife's motive in not marrying the other man was
                            not a bad faith attempt to avoid alimony termination. Setzler v. Setzler, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 781 S.E.2d 64 (2015).

                            Trial court could not automatically terminate alimony upon cohabitation where action was filed before the provisions of this section were applicable. Bookholt v. Bookholt, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 247, 523

                            Mere discovery of dependent spouse's adultery held not sufficient for a finding of "changed circumstances" necessary for a modification of an order of alimony pendente lite under subsection (a) of this section, where the adultery occurred before the parties'
                            separation and before plaintiff filed her complaint for divorce, and where the pleadings revealed that defendant suspected his wife's adultery and alleged adultery as a bar to plaintiff's claim for permanent alimony under

                            Fulfillment of Assumptions in Original Order. - Where in the original order, the court clearly calculated the amount of alimony on the assumption that plaintiff would be able to secure a job paying at least minimum wage, the fact that plaintiff subsequently
                            did so did not substantially alter the relative positions of the parties. Hightower v. Hightower, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 333, 354 S.E.2d 743, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 792</cite>,

                            Where neither party moving for a modification of an award of alimony presented evidence as to the circumstances of the parties on which the original award of alimony was based, and no finding was made as to such circumstances, it could not be determined
                            if there was a change of circumstances, and defendant's motion to reduce the amount of the award would be denied. Gill v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 222 S.E.2d 754 (1976).

                            Refusal to Reduce Alimony Upheld. - Where although plaintiff ex-wife, at time of hearing, made $22,788.00 per year, she had a debt of $20,000.00, much of which was attributable to defendant's failure to make past alimony payments, the trial court did
                            not err in failing to reduce defendant ex-husband's alimony payments to her. Patton v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 364 S.E.2d 700 (1988).

         No Change of Circumstances from Sale of Business.
        </b> - Trial court erred by including proceeds from the sale of a husband's business assets as increased income and a substantial change of circumstances to support a modification to agreed upon alimony and child support
                            because there was no evidence and finding that the sale of the business assets resulted in actual income to the husband; the fact that the purchase price was paid to the husband did not convert the payment and receipt of proceeds
                            from sale of a distributed sole asset into income. Shirey v. Shirey, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 820 (2019).

                            Change of Circumstances Not Shown. - Findings of fact found by the trial court held supported by the evidence and clearly and more than amply supported the court's conclusion that defendant had failed to show a substantial change of circumstances that
                            would warrant a modification of consent judgment providing for alimony and child support. Outlaw v. Outlaw, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 366 S.E.2d 247 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Former husband's motion to modify alimony was properly denied because the evidence supported the finding that he had continued meeting his financial obligations and had made substantial discretionary purchases and investments, as he made his alimony payments
                            in full and in a timely manner, and an increase in his expenses was based on voluntary choices and expenditures. Kelly v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 747 S.E.2d 268 (2013).

                            Alimony was properly not modified because upon review of the relevant factors, a substantial change in circumstances was not shown with respect to the husband's income, or as to both parties' expenses or other relevant factors. Kelly v. Kelly,

                            Dependent Spouse Status. - In determining whether a change in circumstances had occurred for purposes of a motion to terminate alimony, a trial court was not allowed to reconsider a spouse's dependent spouse status, as that was adjudicated at initial
                            alimony hearing; alimony could have been reduced to zero, but that did not result in loss of dependent spouse status. Honeycutt v. Honeycutt, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite> 673, 568 S.E.2d
                            260 (2002).

                            Remand from Appellate Court. - If, on remand from the appeal of an alimony award, the ex-husband were not afforded the chance to present new evidence of changed circumstances, the ex-husband would be deprived of the statutory right to move for a modification
                            of alimony based upon a change of circumstances for the five-year period from the initial order until the hearing on the prior remand. Rhew v. Felton, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 475,

                            Evidence Sufficient to Show Voluntary Assumption of Marital Rights, Duties, and Obligations, Which Could be Sufficient to Show Cohabitation. - Summary judgment under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                            Rule 56(e) was not proper with regard to an ex-husband's motion to terminate an alimony order pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.9" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.9</a></cite> because the forecast of the evidence
                            was sufficient to show the voluntary assumption of marital rights, duties, and obligations by a man and an ex-wife, which could be sufficient to establish cohabitation. Bird v. Bird, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 774</cite>,

                            Legislative Intent. - The legislative intent, as expressed in this section, is that the public policy of North Carolina shall be in favor of modification of alimony provisions contained in consent judgments and the analogous area of incorporated separation
                            agreements. Acosta v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 111, 318 S.E.2d 551 (1984).

                            Separation agreements that have not been incorporated into a court order cannot be modified by the court except with the consent of the parties. Voshell v. Voshell, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 315 S.E.2d

                            Two Types of Consent Judgments No Longer Distinguished. - Two separate forms of consent judgments within domestic relations law, i.e., court approved contracts and court ordered consent judgments resulting from adoption of separation agreements, will
                            no longer be recognized. Walters v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 381</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 338 (1983).

                            All Separation Agreements Approved by Court Are Modifiable. - Whenever the parties bring their separation agreements before the court for the court's approval, it will no longer be treated as a contract between the parties. All separation agreements approved
                            by the court as judgments of the court will be treated similarly, to-wit, as court ordered judgments. These court ordered separation agreements, as consent judgments, are modifiable, and enforceable by the contempt powers of
                            the court, in the same manner as any other judgment in a domestic relations case. Walters v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 381</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 338 (1983).

                            is to be considered as part of a court ordered judgment and is thus modifiable and enforceable by the contempt powers of the court, applies only to judgments that were entered after January 11, 1983. Doub v. Doub, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C.

                            The parties can avoid the burdens of a court judgment by not submitting their agreement to the court. By not coming to court, the parties preserve their agreement as a contract, to be enforced and modified under traditional contract principles. Walters
                            v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 381</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 338 (1983).

                            Options of Parties. - Consenting parties may still elect any of the options available to them prior to this opinion. For example, the parties may keep the property settlement provision aspects of their separation agreement out of court and in contract,
                            while presenting their provision for alimony to the court for approval. The result of such action would be that the alimony provision is enforceable and modifiable as a court order while the property settlement provisions would
                            be enforceable and modifiable under traditional contract methods. Walters v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 381</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 338 (1983).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            The power of the court to enforce its judgment is no less and no greater for a court-adopted consent judgment than for a judgment resulting from a jury verdict in a hotly contested adversary proceeding. Henderson v. Henderson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 401</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 345 (1983).

                        <p>
                            Once a separation agreement is incorporated into a court order, it loses its character as a contract and becomes a court order, which must then be enforced through the contempt powers of the court. Pitts v. Broyhill,
                            <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 364 S.E.2d 738 (1988).

                            Nature of Award Is Determinative. - Whether a decree or award made pursuant to an agreement or arrangement between the parties is subject to modification may depend upon whether it is in effect an award of alimony or support or an adjustment and settlement
                            of property rights. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 246 S.E.2d 591 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698 (1979).

                        <p>
                            Intent That Payments Were Alimony. - Ex-husband was entitled to termination of his alimony obligation under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.9ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.9(b)</a></cite>, because the ex-wife was
                            cohabitating and the consent order showed that parties intended to support ex-wife alimony payments; ex-wife was dependent spouse, ex-husband supporting spouse with ability to pay amounts in order, and the award was fair and
                            equitable. Underwood v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 235</cite>, 717 S.E.2d 361 (2011).

                            Agreement as to Alimony Is Binding. - Parties to a divorce may enter into a valid agreement settling the question of alimony, and unless the court then orders alimony to be paid, the terms of the agreement are binding and can only be modified by the consent
                            of both parties. Crutchley v. Crutchley, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 518</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 793 (1982).

                            Provisions of a valid arbitration award concerning alimony may by agreement be made binding on the parties and nonmodifiable by the courts, although provisions of the award concerning custody and child support continue to be within the court's jurisdiction
                            and are modifiable pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-13.7" target="_self">G.S. 50-13.7</a></cite>. Crutchley v. Crutchley, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 518</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 793

                            And Consent Judgment Settling All Rights of Parties May Not Be Modified. - A judgment which purports to be a complete settlement of all property and marital rights between the parties and which does not award alimony within the accepted definition of
                            that term is not subject to modification even though it adjudges that the wife recover a specific money judgment. This is a consent judgment in its technical sense. Britt v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                            705, 245 S.E.2d 381 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the support provision and the division of property constitute a reciprocal consideration so that the entire agreement would be destroyed by a modification of the support provision, they are not separable and may not be changed without the consent of
                            both parties. Britt v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 705, 245 S.E.2d 381 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a divorce decree or a consent judgment merely approves and sanctions the support payments which the parties have agreed in a separation agreement will be paid to a spouse, then the separation agreement is simply a contract approved by the court. It
                            cannot be modified by order of the court. Cecil v. Cecil, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 296 S.E.2d 329 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 468</cite>, 299 S.E.2d

                            But Consent Order for Alimony May Be Modified. - Under subsection (a) of this section, the spouse may obtain a modification of the order for permanent alimony upon a showing of changed circumstances, even though the order was by consent. Seaborn v. Seaborn,
                            <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 556, 233 S.E.2d 67 (1977); Bowes v. Bowes, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 259 S.E.2d 389 (1979).

                            Where Court Adopts Parties' Agreement as Its Own. - Where a court adopts the agreement of the parties as its own determination of the rights of the parties and orders the husband to pay alimony, the consent judgment is a decree of the court and is modifiable
                            and enforceable by contempt. Jones v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 256 S.E.2d 474 (1979).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A court-adopted consent judgment in a domestic setting has been variously characterized as a species of contract which has been superseded by the court's adoption of the agreement between the parties as its own determination of their respective rights
                            and obligations. Once the court adopts the agreement of the parties and sets it forth as a judgment of the court with appropriate ordering language and the signature of the court, the contractual character of the agreement
                            is subsumed into the court-ordered judgment. At that point the court and the parties are no longer dealing with a mere contract between the parties. That is not to say that such a contract may not eventually result in a judgment
                            of the court which would be enforceable by contempt. Henderson v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 401</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 345 (1983).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For a court to have power to modify a consent judgment, the first requirement of this section, as with case law, is that the judgment consented to be an order of a court. The second essential requirement is that the order be one to pay alimony. White
                            v. White, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698 (1979).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the court incorporates by reference a separation agreement into a consent judgment, making the agreement a part of the judgment and ordering compliance with its terms, the agreement merges into the consent judgment and is superseded by the court's
                            decree, any language to the contrary notwithstanding. Marks v. Marks, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 447</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 859 (1986), decided under the law as it existed prior to Walters v. Walters,
                            <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 381</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 338, reh'g denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 703</cite>, 301 S.E.2d 397 (1983).

                            Unless Reciprocity Would Thereby Be Destroyed. - If the court adopts the separation agreement as its own determination of the rights and obligations of the parties and orders the support payments to be made, the separation agreement becomes a decree of
                            the court. The support payments may then be modified upon a showing of a change in circumstances, unless the support provision and the other provisions of the separation agreement constitute reciprocal consideration for each
                            other so that the agreement would be destroyed by a modification of the support provision. Cecil v. Cecil, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 296 S.E.2d 329 (1982), cert. denied,
                            <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 468</cite>, 299 S.E.2d 220 (1983).

                            Even though denominated as such, provisions in a consent order for periodic support payments to a dependent spouse may not be alimony within the meaning of this section and thus modifiable if they and other provisions for a property division between the
                            parties constitute reciprocal consideration for each other. Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 177</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 840 (1982); Doub v.

                            Even though denominated as such, support payment provisions may not be alimony, and thus modifiable, if those provisions and other provisions for a property division between the parties constitute a complete settlement of all property and marital rights
                            between the parties. Furthermore, where those provisions constitute a reciprocal consideration, so that the entire agreement would be destroyed by a modification of the support provision, they are not separable and may not
                            be changed without the consent of both parties. Walters v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 284 S.E.2d 151 (1981), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 381</cite>,

                            Where provisions for alimony payments were included in one subsection of an eleven-part section of a separation agreement, in which section the parties detailed a "division and settlement of marital rights and remaining properties," the provisions for
                            alimony payments to plaintiff wife and the other property distributions as provided by the separation agreement were clearly reciprocal and therefore not separable or modifiable. Doub v. Doub,

                            Support Provisions Merged into Consent Order so as to Preclude Modification. - Evidence held to support court's findings and conclusion that the support provisions in a separation agreement merged into a consent order and made a decree of the court were
                            not separable but were reciprocal with the property settlement provisions, so as to preclude modification. Cecil v. Cecil, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 328 S.E.2d 899 (1985), decided

                            Separable Provisions in Consent Judgment. - An agreement for the division of property rights and an order for the payment of alimony may be included as separable provisions in a consent judgment. In such event the division of property would be beyond
                            the power of the court to change, but the order for future installments of alimony would be subject to modification in a proper case. However, if the support provision and the division of property constitute a reciprocal consideration
                            so that the entire agreement would be destroyed by a modification of the support provision, they are not separable and may not be changed without the consent of both parties. Jones v. Jones,

                        <p>
                            In North Carolina (1) an agreement for division of property rights, and (2) an order for the payment of alimony, within the accepted definition of that term, may be included as separable provisions in a consent judgment. In such a case, the alimony provision
                            is subject to modification where it has been ordered by the district court. However, if the support provision and the division of property constitute a reciprocal consideration so that the entire agreement would be destroyed
                            by a modification of the support provision, they are not separable and may not be changed without the consent of both parties. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 246 S.E.2d

                            Where plaintiff failed to present any evidence to the district court which would tend to rebut the presumption of separability of provisions, the deed of separation incorporated into a 1974 consent judgment between the parties would not be deemed an integrated
                            property settlement which could not be modified by the trial court. Marks v. Marks, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 447</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 859 (1986), decided under the law as it existed prior to

                            How Separability Determined. - While an agreement for the division of property rights and an order for the payment of alimony may be included as separate provisions in a consent judgment, the fact that both provisions are included in the judgment is,
                            standing alone, inconclusive of the issue of separability. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698 (1979).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recitals in a consent judgment and the judgment of divorce to the effect that all matters in controversy arising from the pleadings had been agreed upon were not determinable upon the question as to whether the support provision of the consent decree
                            was separable, and therefore modifiable, or instead constituted consideration for a property settlement. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 246 S.E.2d 591 (1978), aff'd,
                            <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698 (1979).

                        <p>
                            In determining whether a provision in a consent judgment is for alimony alone and thus severable from the remaining provisions and terminable upon the wife's remarriage, or whether the provision for alimony and the provisions for division of property
                            constitute reciprocal consideration so that they are not separable and may not be changed without the consent of both parties, a consent judgment must be construed in the same manner as a contract to ascertain the intent of
                            the parties. Allison v. Allison, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 277 S.E.2d 551, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 543</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 660 (1981).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where a consent judgment is ambiguous, the intentions of the parties must be determined from evidence of the facts and circumstances surrounding its entry, just as the intentions of the parties to an ambiguous written contract must be determined from
                            the surrounding circumstances. Barr v. Barr, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 217, 284 S.E.2d 762 (1981).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the intention of the parties regarding the reciprocity of agreements in a consent order is not evident from a reading thereof, evidence of the negotiations and contemporaneous property settlement agreements of the parties is admissible to clarify
                            the uncertainty created when the nonmodification provision of the order appears to be void as a matter of law under this section. Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 177</cite>, 287 S.E.2d
                            840 (1982).

                            Burden of Proof on Separability. - In cases in which the question of whether provisions in a consent judgment or separation agreement are separable is not adequately addressed in the document itself, there is a presumption that provisions in a separation
                            agreement or consent judgment made a part of the court's order are separable and that provisions for support payments therein are subject to modification upon an appropriate showing of changed circumstances. The effect of this
                            presumption is to place the burden of proof on the issue of separability on the party opposing modification. The policies underlying the presumption require that this burden be discharged only by a preponderance of the evidence.
                            White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698 (1979).

                        <p>
                            For purposes of determining whether a consent judgment may be modified under this section, there is a presumption that the provisions for property division and support payments are separable. The burden of proof rests on the party opposing modification
                            to show that the provisions are not separable. Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 177</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 840 (1982).

                            Consent Order Purporting to Waive Applicability of Section. - In accord with this section, a consent order containing a proviso purporting to waive the applicability of this section may be modified unless defendant can show that it was an integral part
                            of the property settlement. Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 177</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 840 (1982).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By enacting this section, the legislature has clearly expressed that it is the public policy of this State that consent orders to pay alimony are modifiable. In the usual case a proviso in an order purporting to waive applicability of this section would
                            be contrary to this policy and, therefore, without force and effect. Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 177</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 840 (1982).

                        <p>
                            In a consent judgment, the word "alimony" and the provision that plaintiff's support payments to defendant would continue "until the defendant remarries or dies," is evidence, albeit inconclusive, of the parties' intention to treat the support provisions
                            as alimony. Barr v. Barr, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 217, 284 S.E.2d 762 (1981).

                        <p>
                            Language in a consent judgment finding plaintiff a "dependent" spouse and defendant a "supporting" spouse are indicative of the payment and receipt of alimony and the absence of this language supports an interpretation that the payment provisions are
                            not alimony. Walters v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 284 S.E.2d 151 (1981), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 381</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 338 (1983); Barr

                            Language in the preamble to a consent judgment that "the parties had settled their differences" is subject to the interpretation that the agreement was considered a complete settlement by the parties.

                            Lump Sum Payment Pursuant to Negotiated Settlement. - The trial court did not have authority to reduce an executed lump sum payment and order a refund of a portion thereof, where the lump sum payment represented not only child support, but also constituted
                            a negotiated settlement of all matters of dispute between the parties, including the effect of foreseeable changes in those matters, and there were no compelling equitable circumstances justifying a refund. Reavis v. Reavis,

                            for a property division between the parties constitute reciprocal consideration for each other. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698 (1979); Jones v. Jones,

                            was required to determine the intent of the parties regarding whether the provisions of the agreement were separable or integrated, and it was error for the trial court to refuse to allow husband to present evidence on this
                            issue. Lemons v. Lemons, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 406 S.E.2d 8 (1991), decided under law in effect in 1978 at time of consent decree.

                            Summary Judgment Inappropriate in Light of Conflicting Evidence as to Wife's Cohabitation. - In a former wife's suit against her former husband for breach of a separation agreement in which the husband raised cohabitation as an affirmative defense, it
                            was error to grant the wife summary judgment in light of the conflicting evidence as to her cohabitation with a male friend. This conflicting evidence, which included evidence of how often the friend stayed overnight at the
                            wife's residence, whether he permanently kept his clothes there, and to what extent he used the wife's residence as his base of operations for his business, required evaluation of subjective intent, which was inappropriate
                            for summary judgment. Craddock v. Craddock, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 806, 656 S.E.2d 716 (2008).

                            Vacation of Consent Judgments Without Making Specific Findings Held Error. - While a consent order for alimony or alimony pendente lite may be modified or vacated at any time upon motion and a showing of changed circumstances, where defendant husband
                            offered some evidence of changed circumstances but the trial court failed to comply with the statutory mandate as to the making of specific findings, and erroneously ruled that consent judgments were invalid for failure of
                            the court to make a finding of dependency, the cause would be remanded for a de novo hearing. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 245 S.E.2d 94 (1978).

                            Termination of Alimony Based on Cohabitation. - Trial court did not err in denying the husband's motion for summary judgment arguing that the wife's cohabitation was a bar to the enforcement of the alimony provision of the parties' separation and property
                            settlement agreement and arguing that the agreement was void as against public policy because the parties' agreement provided for termination only upon the husband's death, the wife's remarriage, or the wife's death, but not
                            upon her cohabitation with another individual; this statute only reflected the public policy regarding court ordered alimony or postseparation support; and this statute was not intended to interfere with the freedom of the
                            parties to agree to terms for alimony that was purely contractual, and not court ordered. Patterson v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 774 S.E.2d 860 (2015).

                            Motion to Modify Due to Cohabitation Properly Denied. - Husband's motion seeking to vacate the alimony provision in his separation agreement with his wife, which had been incorporated into the parties' divorce decree, was properly denied as the wife was
                            not cohabitating; she and her boyfriend had sexual relations and went on trips and dates, but there was no evidence that they had assumed the marital rights, duties, and obligations that were usually manifested by married people.

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in failing to determine that a wife was cohabiting with a man because the court found no evidence of joint financial obligations of a home, combining finances, pooling of resources, consistent merging of families, or dwelling together
                            continuously and habitually. Crews v. Crews, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 826 S.E.2d 194 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Vested Periodic Payments. - Where trial court delineated alimony payable by husband to wife as a "lump sum" or as a "fixed amount," and the payment methodology was not in a single payment but instead was in periodic payments, wife's remarriage terminated
                            the monthly alimony obligations not yet due and payable, as they had not vested prior to remarriage. Potts v. Tutterow, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 97</cite>, 455 S.E.2d 156, rehearing denied,
                            <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 364</cite>, 458 S.E.2d 189 (1995).

                            Obligation Ceases upon Remarriage of Dependent Spouse. - Defendant's obligation to make payments pursuant to a consent judgment with plaintiff which designated such payments as alimony ceased as a matter of law pursuant to this section when the plaintiff
                            remarried. Martin v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 26 S.E.2d 456 (1975).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whether the alimony award is in the form of a "lump sum" or "periodic payments" is irrelevant since subsection (b) clearly provides that the supporting spouse's obligation to pay any alimony is terminated by the dependant spouse's remarriage and does
                            not distinguish between the method of payment. Potts v. Tutterow, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 360, 442 S.E.2d 90 (1994), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 97</cite>, 455 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            Obligation Held to Terminate. - Where in consent judgment incorporating parties' deed of separation and property settlement, $400.00 per month payment was twice denominated "alimony," while there was no reference whatsoever to the distribution of stock,
                            vehicles, and other property, the $400.00 payment was alimony, and defendant's obligation to make such payments terminated upon plaintiff's remarriage in accordance with the mandate of subsection (b) of this section. Garner

                            Terminating Alimony on the Basis of Cohabitation. - This section affirmatively states that cohabitation automatically terminates any alimony obligation, but the supporting spouse must first file a motion with the trial court, notify the dependant spouse,
                            and obtain a court order authorizing termination of payments as of a date certain. Williamson v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 702, 543 S.E.2d 897 (2001).

                            But Not Retroactively. - Registration is a ministerial duty of the clerk, not exercising any power over the obligor's person or property. Such registration cannot lawfully transform foreign alimony orders that are modifiable as to past-due installments
                            in the jurisdiction of rendition into North Carolina orders subject to North Carolina law retrospectively. Allsup v. Allsup, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 533, 363 S.E.2d 883, aff'd,

                            it is advisable that he should do so by counterclaim specifically alleging a change of circumstances and specifically seeking relief only as to future payments.

                    the court shall enter a judgment against the spouse to whom the payments were made for the amount of all alimony paid by the supporting spouse to that spouse pending a final disposition of the case. In addition, upon motion by the

                            Constitutionality. - This section is not unconstitutionally vague. Ellis v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 634, 315 S.E.2d 526 (1984).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Legislative Intent. - In enacting the equitable distribution statute, the General Assembly intended to avoid taxable events which would chill the use of equitable distribution. Lawing v. Lawing, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                            159, 344 S.E.2d 100 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The legislature did not intend the Equitable Distribution Act to apply solely to property acquired on or after the effective date of the act or its amendments. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>,
                            368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Only married persons are afforded the protections of this statute; therefore, the Court of Appeals would not expand the legislature's clear definition of marital property to include property acquired prior to marriage. McIver v. McIver,
                            <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 116, 374 S.E.2d 144 (1988).

                            No Right to Jury Trial in Equitable Distribution Action. - No right to bring an action for equitable distribution of marital property existed prior to the adoption of the equitable distribution statutes, this section and

                            under the Constitution of North Carolina. Kiser v. Kiser, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 502</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 487 (1989).

Ellis v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite>                            634, 315 S.E.2d 526 (1984).

                            Same Rules to Apply to Both Spouses. - With the enactment of this section the legislature indicated its view that the same rules should apply to both spouses in determining ownership of property. Mims v. Mims, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 41</cite>,
                            286 S.E.2d 779 (1982).

                            This section is a remedial statute enacted to ensure a fairer distribution of marital assets than under common-law rules. Wade v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 325 S.E.2d 260, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 612</cite>,

                            Separate Trials for Divorce and Distribution. - The trial court's order granting the plaintiff's motion for separate trials of his claim for absolute divorce and the defendant's claim for equitable distribution of the marital property did not constitute
                            an abuse of discretion, nor did it prejudice the defendant's substantial rights. Sharp v. Sharp, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 351 S.E.2d 799 (1987).

                            Trial judge is required to conduct a three-stage analysis in order to equitably distribute the marital assets. He must first ascertain, upon appropriate findings of fact, what is marital property; then determine the net market value of the marital property
                            as of the date of separation; and finally, make an equitable distribution between the parties. Willis v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 546, 358 S.E.2d 571 (1987).

                        <p>
                            In applying our equitable distribution statutes, the trial court must follow a three-step procedure: (1) classification, (2) evaluation and (3) distribution. Seifert v. Seifert, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 329,
                            346 S.E.2d 504 (1986), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 367</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 506 (1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court erred as a matter of law in rejecting a wife's claim for equitable distribution where it simply took the parties at their word that each would pay certain debts, without actually classifying, valuing, and distributing the debts as required
                            under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(a)</a></cite>, and it had improperly based its determination that equitable distribution was not warranted on the wife's
                            failure to negotiate a settlement with the husband's counsel. Eason v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 784 S.E.2d 200 (2016).

                        <p>
                            Equal division of marital property is favored by public policy behind the Equitable Distribution Act. Weaver v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 324 S.E.2d 915 (1985), overruled in part on other grounds,
                            Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).

                        <p>
                            One policy underlying the Equitable Distribution Act is to wind up the marriage and distribute the marital property fairly with as much certainty and finality as possible. Lawing v. Lawing, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                            159, 344 S.E.2d 100 (1986).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Public policy of this State is that equitable distribution of property shall follow a decree of absolute divorce. Hendrix v. Hendrix, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 313 S.E.2d 25 (1984).

                        <p>
                            But Written Agreement Between the Parties Is an Alternative. - It is North Carolina's public policy that an equitable distribution of property shall follow a decree of absolute divorce. However, a resort to the equitable distribution law is not the only
                            recognized way for married people to dispose of their marital property. An alternative is in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(d)</a></cite>. Case v. Case,

                        <p>
                            Purpose of Section. - This section is designed to divide property equitably, based upon the relative positions of the parties at the time of the divorce, rather than on what they may have intended when the property was acquired. Mims v. Mims,
                            <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 41</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 779 (1982).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This section's primary focus is to devise a procedure for equitably distributing "marital," as opposed to "separate," property upon dissolution of the marriage. Mims v. Mims, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 41</cite>, 286 S.E.2d
                            779 (1982).

                        <p>
                            This section reflects a trend nationwide towards recognizing marriage as a partnership, a shared enterprise to which both spouses make valuable contributions, albeit often in different ways. Loeb v. Loeb, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite>                            205, 324 S.E.2d 33 (1985), overruled in part on other grounds, Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Equitable distribution reflects the idea that marriage is a partnership enterprise to which both spouses make vital contributions and which entitles the homemaker spouse to a share of the property acquired during the relationship. White v. White,
                            <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 770</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 829 (1985).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A spouse's vested right to equitable distribution of marital property does not create a property right in marital property, nor does separation create a lien on specific marital property in favor of the spouse. Hearndon v. Hearndon,
                            <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 98, 510 S.E.2d 183 (1999).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Effect of Section. - This section was enacted in recognition of marriage as a partnership, economic and otherwise, to which both parties contribute, either directly or indirectly. By enacting this section, the Legislature granted courts the power to consider
                            factors other than legal title in distributing the marital assets upon the dissolution of the marriage, thereby permitting the courts to make an equitable distribution which effects a return to each party of that which he or
                            she contributed to the marriage. Hinton v. Hinton, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 665, 321 S.E.2d 161 (1984).

                            Section Is Applicable Only to Divorce Actions Filed on or After October 1, 1981. - The Equitable Distribution Act was enacted in 1981 and made applicable only when the action for an absolute divorce is filed on or after October 1, 1981. Talent v. Talent,
                            <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 334 S.E.2d 256 (1985).

                            Jurisdiction Must Meet Minimum Contacts Standard. - In an equitable distribution action, the court is exercising jurisdiction over the interests of persons in property and not over a status of the parties. Exercise of this jurisdiction must meet the minimum
                            contacts standard. Carroll v. Carroll, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 363 S.E.2d 872 (1988).

                            Personalty in State Is Not Sufficient to Confer Jurisdiction. - The fact that there exists some personal property in North Carolina in which a nonresident defendant may have an interest because of the equitable distribution statute is not alone sufficient
                            to establish jurisdiction over defendant or his property. Carroll v. Carroll, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 363 S.E.2d 872 (1988).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Jurisdiction Not Shown. - Where defendant had not lived in North Carolina during any part of the parties' marriage, although certain property of the parties was located in North Carolina, and there was no indication of any action by defendant purposefully
                            directed towards this State, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over defendant and his property for equitable distribution purposes and therefore could not properly determine the equitable distribution claim. Carroll v. Carroll,
                            <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 363 S.E.2d 872 (1988).

                            Right to Equitable Distribution Must Be Asserted Before Final Divorce. - Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11" target="_self">G.S. 50-11</a></cite>, a judgment of absolute divorce destroys the right to equitable
                            distribution unless the right is asserted prior to judgment of absolute divorce. Howell v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 87</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 585 (1987).

                            Where death ends all chance for divorce, any equitable distribution action then pending must abate; the 1995 amendment to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-21" target="_self">G.S. 50-21</a></cite> did not change the relationship
                            between equitable distribution and divorce. Instead, the amendment continued the legislative trend for equitable distribution to occur at any time prior to or after an absolute divorce. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 220</cite>,
                            539 S.E.2d 621 (2000), decided prior to the 2001 amendment clarifying that an action for equitable distribution does not abate upon the death of a party.

                            Heirs of wife's deceased husband were necessary parties to equitable distribution action in which husband's administrator had been substituted as defendant, and they were properly added as parties defendant. Swindell v. Lewis,

                            The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a compulsory reference in an equitable distribution proceeding. Vick v. Vick, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 343 S.E.2d 245, cert.

                            Trial court erred in granting defendant wife's motion to be "relieved of the effect" of a divorce judgment solely to the extent that the judgment barred her claim for equitable distribution. Howell v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 87</cite>,

                            Claim to Property Was Not Notice of Equitable Distribution Claim. - In divorce case, defendant's answer asserting a claim to an interest in a specific piece of property, or to proceeds in plaintiff's possession flowing from defendant's interest in that
                            piece of property, was not sufficient to put plaintiff on notice that he was asserting a claim for equitable distribution under this section. Goodwin v. Zeydel, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite>                            670, 387 S.E.2d 57 (1990).

                            Attorneys' fees are not recoverable from the other spouse in an action for equitable distribution, so that, in a combined action, the fees awarded must be attributable to work by the attorneys on the divorce, alimony and child support actions. Patterson

                            Power of Court Upon Finding of Contempt. - Upon a finding of contempt, in situations where original order requires transfer of property (including intangible property such as that represented by stock certificates), the trial court has authority to order
                            contemnor to transfer said property as a condition of purging contempt, but does not have authority to require contemnor to pay compensatory damages incurred as a result of his noncompliance with original order. Hartsell v.

                            Equitable Distribution Claim Was Properly Extinguished by Parties' Reconciliation. - Although they had been separated and filed for divorced, an equitable distribution claim was properly extinguished by operation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1l1" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(l)(1)</a></cite>                            because the parties' reconciliation was established since the wife provided the husband with medical care at a hospital and at his home prior to his death, they told friends that they had reconciled, and they behaved as if
                            they were reconciled, including sharing a marital bed. Casella v. Alden, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 24, 682 S.E.2d 455 (2009).

                            Classification as Marital Property by Stipulation of Parties. - Husband's deferred compensation plan was marital property, notwithstanding that the deferred compensation plan had not vested, where the parties had stipulated in a pre-trial order that the
                            deferred compensation plan was marital property. Hamby v. Hamby, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 635, 547 S.E.2d 110 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 69</cite>, 553

                            North Carolina recognizes the dual nature of property acquired with both marital and separate assets. This approach has generally been referred to as the source of funds theory. Wade v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite>                            372, 325 S.E.2d 260, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 612</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 616 (1985).

                            Property can have a dual nature, and can be classified as part separate and part marital. This approach takes into account the active appreciation of separate property which often results from contributions made by one or both spouses. Nix v. Nix,
                            <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 341 S.E.2d 116 (1986).

                            a dual nature and be classified as part separate and part marital, and where property was dual in nature, the court applied a "source of funds" approach to distinguish between marital and separate contributions to the property,
                            and the marital and separate estates were each entitled to an interest in the property in the ratio its contribution bore to the total investment in the property.

                            Dual Nature of Home Not Shown. - Trial court erred in concluding that the home purchased by the parties was only partly marital property, where the wife met her burden of showing that the home was marital property, by showing that it was acquired by the
                            couple during the marriage, and was owned by them on the date of separation, and no evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that the husband had no intention of making a gift of his separate funds to acquire the home;
                            however, the husband was entitled to have the gift of his separate property to the marital estate considered as a distributional factor. Walter v. Walter, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite>                            723, 561 S.E.2d 571 (2002).

                            Three-Step Analysis of Equitable Distribution. - A trial judge is required to conduct a three-step analysis when making an equitable distribution of the marital assets. These steps are: (1) To determine which property is marital property, (2) to calculate
                            the net value of the property, fair market value less encumbrances, and (3) to distribute the property in an equitable manner. Beightol v. Beightol, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 58,

                            The requirements that the trial court (1) classify and value all property of the parties, both separate and marital, (2) consider the separate property in making a distribution of the marital property, and (3) distribute the marital property necessarily
                            exist only when evidence is presented to the trial court which supports the claimed classification, valuation and distribution. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 387

                            "Source of Funds" Rule as to When Property Is Acquired. - The Court of Appeals has adopted the source of funds rule, by which property is "acquired" as it is paid for, so that it may include both marital and separate ownership interests. Under the source
                            of funds rule acquisition is an ongoing process. It does not depend upon inception of title, but upon monetary or other contributions made by one or both of the parties. McLeod v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite>                            144, 327 S.E.2d 910, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 331</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 488 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Under the source of the funds theory, when both the marital and separate estates contribute assets towards the acquisition of property, each estate is entitled to an interest in the property in the ratio which its contribution bears to the total investment
                            in the property. Thus, both the separate and marital estates receive a proportionate and fair return on their investments. Wade v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 325 S.E.2d
                            260, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 612</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 616 (1985).

                        <p>
                            The courts have adopted a source of funds approach to distinguish marital and separate contributions to a single asset. Under the source of funds approach, each party retains as separate property the amount he contributed to purchase the property plus
                            passive appreciation in value. McLean v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 285, 363 S.E.2d 95 (1987), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 543</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 376 (1988).

                        <p>
                            In applying the source of funds rule, the financial or other contributions by the marital and separate estates toward the acquisition of property must be identified and accounted for. McIver v. McIver, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite>                            116, 374 S.E.2d 144 (1988).

                        <p>
                            The trial court erred in using a source of funds approach to determine what portion of a tract of land was marital property as opposed to separate property; the source of funds analysis is not applicable until the donor spouse has rebutted the gift presumption
                            by clear, cogent and convincing evidence. Lawrence v. Lawrence, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 394 S.E.2d 267 (1990).

                            "Source of Funds" Rule Is Applicable Even When Property Is Converted After Separation. - North Carolina has adopted the "source of funds" rule to determine whether and to what extent an asset is part of the marital estate. Even when property is converted
                            after the date of separation, this rule continues to apply, and the dispositive question in determining if an asset is a marital asset remains whether the source of funds therefor were marital funds. Mauser v. Mauser,
                            <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 330 S.E.2d 63 (1985); Freeman v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 421 S.E.2d 623 (1992).

                        <p>
                            Only after determining the nature of the asset received by one spouse after separation, yet claimed by the other to be "marital property," may a classification be made of that asset as between "marital" or "separate" property. Locklear v. Locklear,
                            <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 374 S.E.2d 406 (1988).

                            Premarital Contributions. - Premarital contributions are relevant in an equitable distribution proceeding, to the extent those contributions constitute separate property, entitling the contributing spouse to credit when property of mixed marital and separate
                            character is distributed. McIver v. McIver, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 116, 374 S.E.2d 144 (1988).

                        <p>
                            For the purpose of classification of property, the marital estate is frozen as of the date of separation. While its components clearly may increase in value after separation and before distribution, no new property may be added to the marital estate after
                            the date of separation. Becker v. Becker, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 364 S.E.2d 175 (1988).

                            Reduction in Separate Debt Using Marital Assets. - A reduction in the separate debt of a party to a marriage, caused by the expenditure of marital funds, is, in the absence of an agreement to repay the marital estate, neither an asset nor a debt of the
                            marital estate and such a reduction is properly considered as a distributional factor within the context of subdivision (c)(12). Adams v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 443

                        <p>
                            The burden of proof is on the party seeking to classify a debt as marital. If the debt is classified as separate, the court must value it and then, pursuant to subdivision (c)(1), consider it in making a distribution. Byrd v. Owens,
                            <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 418, 358 S.E.2d 102 (1987).

                        <p>
                            The burden of proof is on the party claiming that property is marital property to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property: (1) was acquired by either spouse or both spouses; (2) during the marriage; (3) before the date of the separation
                            of the parties; and (4) is presently owned. Caudill v. Caudill, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 854, 509 S.E.2d 246 (1998).

                            Loan Payments as Distributions. - Lawnmower was purchased post-separation in the husband's name and the limited liability company (LLC) made the loan payments, and while it might appear that some part of the mower would qualify as divisible property,
                            there was no evidence of depreciation or the amount still owed; the trial court did not err in treating the loan payments on the mower as distributions to the Husband from the LLC from which he made the loan payments. Montague

                            Showing That Property Is Separate. - A spouse may challenge a claim that property is marital by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property: (1) was acquired by the spouse by bequest, devise, descent, or gift from a third party during
                            the course of the marriage; or (2) was acquired by gift from the other spouse during the course of the marriage and the intent that it be separate property was stated in the conveyance; or (3) was acquired in exchange for separate
                            property and no contrary intention that it be marital property was stated in the conveyance. Caudill v. Caudill, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 854, 509 S.E.2d 246 (1998).

                            Classification of Increases in Value to Separate Property - Burden of Proof. - Plaintiff, as the party claiming the increases in value to separate property to be marital, had the burden of showing by the preponderance of the evidence that the increases
                            in value were marital property. Plaintiff met her burden by showing that all the increases in value were acquired by either or both spouses, were acquired during the course of the marriage, were acquired before the date of
                            separation, and were presently owned. Accordingly, the burden shifted to the defendant to show by the preponderance of the evidence that the acquired increases in value to the properties were his separate property. Ciobanu

                            If the party claiming the property to be separate and the party claiming the property to be marital both meet their burdens, then under the statutory scheme of N.C.G.S. subdivisions (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the property is excepted from the definition
                            of marital property and is, therefore, separate property. This allocation of the burdens of proof is consistent with the General Assembly's recent amendment to subsection (b)(1) establishing a rebuttable presumption that property
                            acquired between the dates of marriage and separation is marital property. Ciobanu v. Ciobanu, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 461, 409 S.E.2d 749 (1991).

                            Marital Property Despite No Financial Contribution by One Spouse. - Although one spouse did not make any direct financial contributions to various property from the spouse's own income or separate funds during the marriage, the other spouse's income during
                            the marriage was marital property, and the other spouse's direct financial contributions from the other spouse's income during the marriage were marital contributions.

                            Property acquired after separation of the parties is specifically excepted from the definition of marital property contained in subdivision (b)(1) of this section. However, property acquired in exchange for marital funds is considered marital property
                            to the extent of the contribution even after separation. Peak v. Peak, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 700, 348 S.E.2d 353 (1986), decided under this section as it read in 1983.

                            Use of Marital Property to Acquire Separate Property After Separation. - The fact that marital property was used to acquire other property after the date of the parties' separation did not cause it to lose its marital character. The characterization of
                            property as separate or marital depends not on whether it was acquired after the date of separation, but on whether the source of funds for its purchase was marital property or separate property. Talent v. Talent,

                            Home, which the parties had contracted to purchase before their separation, but which the husband, after separation, had purchased using marital funds and a mortgage that he obtained in his own name, was properly considered marital property under

                            Acquisition of Entireties Property in Exchange for Separate Property. - When property titled by the entireties is acquired in exchange for separate property, the conveyance itself indicates the "contrary intention" to preserving separate property required
                            by the statute. Furthermore, when separate property is used as consideration to acquire entireties property, a gift of separate property to the marital estate is presumed, which is rebuttable by clear, cogent, and convincing
                            evidence. Manes v. Harrison-Manes, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 338 S.E.2d 815 (1986).

                            Presumption of gift of property to which title is taken by the entirety is limited to real property acquired by both spouses, as tenants by the entirety, in exchange for the separate property of one of them. The presumption does not extend to jointly
                            held personal property which is acquired in exchange for the separate property of one spouse, as to do so would seem to defeat the legislative intent of subdivision (b)(2) of this section. McLean v. McLean,

                            House Built with Marital Funds on Property Acquired Prior to Marriage. - By treating a house and lot as separate property solely because the house, built with marital funds, was built on land acquired by defendant prior to the marriage, the court erred
                            in classifying the property. Classification must be according to the statutory definitions of separate property and marital property. Cable v. Cable, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 134,

                            that part of the property consisting of the additions, alterations and repairs provided during marriage should have been considered marital in nature and the marital estate was entitled to proportionate return of its investment.

                            was marital or separate property; therefore, the case was remanded for further factual findings on the issue. Rawls v. Rawls, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 381 S.E.2d 179 (1989).

                            estate vested an amount not disclosed in the record, the trial judge should have divided the equity based on the proportion invested by the marital and separate estates, so as to determine what percentage of the total investment
                            in the property was marital and what was separate, and then award each estate a proportionate return on its investment. Willis v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 355 S.E.2d

                            Home Equity Derived from Wife's Contribution. - Where wife's contribution to marital residence was a gift, and there was no statement of her intent that it be separate property, the proportion of the home equity derived from her contribution was marital
                            property. Dewey v. Dewey, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 787, 336 S.E.2d 451 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 376</cite>, 344 S.E.2d 1 (1986).

                            Effect of Dissolution of Tenancy by Entirety. - Although conveyances from wife to husband dissolved tenancy by the entirety in the parcels of land and vested title thereto solely in the husband, as provided by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.039.html#t39a02s39-13.3ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 39-13.3(c)</a></cite>,
                            husband nevertheless acquired title to the property thereunder, not by gift, but during the course of the marriage and before the parties separated, and property so acquired is ipso facto marital property. Thus, contrary to
                            the husband's contention, dissolving of the tenancy by entirety did not remove the property involved from the ambit of the Equitable Distribution Act, and the trial judge did not err in finding and concluding otherwise. Beroth

                            as to: (1) the value of plaintiff's minority interest at the time of inheritance; (2) the value of plaintiff's controlling interest at the date of separation; (3) the difference between the two; and (4) the proportion of that
                            difference that were due to active appreciation, i.e., attributable to funds, talent, or labor that were assets of the marital community. The resulting amount would be marital property subject to equitable distribution. McLeod

                            The interests acquired by the parties in a parcel of real property that they purchased together, but as unmarried persons before they were married, were their respective separate property; however, any increases in equity and any debt incurred during

                            Even though a tax refund was not actually paid until the parties separated, Court did not err in treating it as divisible marital property because it was attributable to activities of both parties in the course of their involvement with a family business.

                            Term "acquired" has a dynamic meaning, thus adopting the source of funds theory which recognizes that because property is acquired over time, it may have a dual nature and must therefore be designated according to whether the funds used for acquisition
                            were marital or separate. Tiryakian v. Tiryakian, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 370 S.E.2d 852 (1988).

                            right in the law governing the disposition of property upon divorce which was in effect either at the time the property was acquired or at the time of his marriage. There is no such thing as a vested right in the continuation

                            Awards or settlements arising from a personal injury claim frequently are composed of many elements of recovery, some of which represent compensation for injury to, or loss of, marital property and some of which represent compensation for injury to separate
                            property of the injured spouse. Personal injury recoveries may also include compensation for injury to the separate property of the non-injured spouse, such as the right of consortium, where such injuries have been properly
                            alleged and proved. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 437</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 430 (1986).

                            Proceeds representing a settlement recovered by a spouse upon a claim for his or her personal injuries sustained during the marriage of the parties may constitute marital property subject to distribution upon dissolution of the marriage, depending on
                            the purpose for which they were received. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 437</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 430 (1986).

                            Any part of an award compensating a non-injured spouse for loss of consortium is the separate property of the non-injured spouse. Lilly v. Lilly, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 420 S.E.2d 492 (1992).

                            Although, based on his evidence, husband technically met his burden of proving that insurance proceeds from wife's personal injury settlement were marital property, the characterization of a spouse's personal injury settlement as marital or separate property
                            depends on what the award was intended to replace. Lilly v. Lilly, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 420 S.E.2d 492 (1992).

                            To the extent that an award replaces medical expenses, lost wages, or loss of earning capacity sustained during the marriage, it is marital property subject to equitable distribution. To the extent that the award replaces such economic loss occurring
                            after separation, it is the separate property of the injured spouse. However, if the party claiming that the award is marital, i.e., the noninjured spouse, shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the award was acquired
                            by the injured spouse during the marriage and before separation, then the entire award will be marital property unless the other party proves by a preponderance that the award, or some portion of it, was to compensate for economic
                            loss occurring after the date of separation and is therefore separate property. Freeman v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 421 S.E.2d 623 (1992).

                            Wife was entitled to a claim against one-half of any monies which represented reimbursement for husband's lost wages prior to the parties' separation and those reimbursing him for medical expenses incurred prior to separation. Taylor v. Taylor,
                            <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 374 S.E.2d 644 (1988).

                            Personal injury award is composed of three potential elements of damages: (1) Those compensating the injured spouse for pain and suffering, disability, disfigurement, or lost limbs; (2) those compensating for lost wages, lost earning capacity, and medical
                            and hospital expenses; and (3) those compensating the non-injured spouse for loss of services or loss of consortium. The portion of an award representing compensation for non-economic loss, i.e., personal suffering and disability,
                            is the separate property of the injured spouse; the portion of an award representing compensation for economic loss, i.e., lost wages, loss of earning capacity during the marriage, and medical and hospital expenses paid out
                            of marital funds, is marital property. Dunlap v. Dunlap, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 324, 354 S.E.2d 734 (1987).

                            Husband's Income from Contingent Fee Case. - Husband's income as an attorney from a contingent fee case was wrongly classified because (1) the income was classified as both deferred compensation and divisible income, (2) the income was not deferred compensation,
                            as, at separation, the husband and the husband's law firm were not certain to receive anything from the case, and (3) the income was not divisible property, as the husband had no pre-separation right to income, and the husband
                            was not a party to the contingent fee contract. Green v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 719, 806 S.E.2d 45 (2017), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 485</cite>, 818

                            Distinction Between Active and Passive Appreciation. - There is a distinction between active and passive appreciation of separate property, in that active appreciation refers to financial or managerial contributions of one of the spouses to the separate
                            property during the marriage, while passive appreciation refers to enhancement of the value of separate property due solely to inflation, changing economic conditions or other such circumstances beyond the control of either
                            spouse. O'Brien v. O'Brien, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 411, 508 S.E.2d 300 (1998).

                            Trial court properly classified and valued a husband's interest in a partnership with his father at 50% because the entire appreciation in value of the inherited shares was clearly identified for the trial court, the portion of the appreciation attributable
                            to the active efforts of the parties was property "acquired" during the marriage and was presumably marital in nature, and the active efforts of the husband's father contributed to the increase in the value of husband's interest
                            during the marriage. Blair v. Blair, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 474, 818 S.E.2d 413 (2018).

                            Test for Active Increase. - If either or both of the spouses perform substantial services during the marriage which result in an increase in the value of an investment account, that increase is to be characterized as an active increase and classified
                            as a marital asset. O'Brien v. O'Brien, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 411, 508 S.E.2d 300 (1998).

                            The trial court erred in determining that the plaintiff converted certain marital funds to her own use during the marriage and in treating the allegedly converted funds as part of the marital estate in making its equitable distribution order, as defendant
                            did not prove that any of this money was used to purchase assets that were owned by either of the parties on the date of separation. Lawrence v. Lawrence, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite>                            1, 394 S.E.2d 267 (1990).

                            The ruling was error regardless of whether the property was originally obtained with marital or separate funds. Mauser v. Mauser, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 330 S.E.2d 63 (1985).

                            "Use and Possession" of Marital Asset. - It is plain on the face of this section that the provision for transfer of "the use and possession" of a marital asset contemplates the transfer of an asset in kind; transferring the "use and possession" means
                            that the spouse receiving the transfer is entitled to hold the asset pending a final equitable distribution award and use it as it was meant to be used. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite>                            15, 434 S.E.2d 873 (1993).

                            property or contributing to the marital estate rather than being fixed on the date that legal title to property is obtained. Wade v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 325 S.E.2d

                            Trial court found that the husband removed from the marital home $ 350,000 in cash and checks, which were marital funds, and it was irrelevant whether the cash and checks were actually in the parties' safe on the date of separation as there was no evidence
                            that the cash or checks were ever owned by anyone other than the parties; the cash and checks were presently owned, as per the statute. Sauls v. Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite>                            371, 763 S.E.2d 328 (2014).

                            Evidence of Valuable Consideration Rather Than Donative Intent. - Mobile home park was properly classified as marital property in an equitable distribution order under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(b)(1)</a></cite>                            because both parties operated the park during the marriage and there was no credible documentation of the donative intent of the former husband's father to contradict a general warranty deed showing valuable consideration given
                            for the property. Joyce v. Joyce, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 637 S.E.2d 908 (2006).

                            Joint Account. - Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, creation of a spousal joint account should as a matter of law imply consent by each spouse to the use by the other of funds from the account for purposes of sustaining the family or

                            Trial court did not err in classifying a checking account held in a former husband's name only as marital property because the former wife presented evidence that the bank account in question was opened five days before the parties separated, and the
                            husband failed to rebut, by the greater weight of the evidence, the presumption that the checking account was marital property; Cochran v. Cochran, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 224,

                            Trial court did not err in classifying funds in bank accounts on the date of the parties' separation as marital property because one spouse need not have personally contributed financially to the bank accounts during the marriage to create a marital interest
                            as the other spouse's earnings and efforts during the marriage created the marital interest. Clark v. Dyer, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 9, 762 S.E.2d 838 (2014).

                            It was no error to find a wife did not rebut a presumption that a gift from a husband's father and other relatives was marital property instead of the wife's separate property because (1) the gift was transferred into the husband's and wife's joint account,
                            and (2) competent evidence supported the finding. Rui Dong Zhu v. Lingling Deng, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 803, 794 S.E.2d 808 (2016).

                            Although a husband argued an arbitrator erred in concluding the appreciation in the balance of an investment account contained no separate property, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(b)(2)</a></cite>,
                            there was no evident mistake in the arbitrator's decision to not classify a rollover from a separate brokerage account into the investment account during the marriage as separate property because there were several transfers
                            in the brokerage account during the marriage and trading activity occurred in the investment account after the transfer; the husband was not entitled to vacate the arbitrator's award under the Family Law Arbitration Act,

                            because the balance increase, which occurred between the date of marriage and the date of separation, was the result of the husband's substantial activity; the husband testified he met with the broker every month or two and
                            authorized every trade, and the evidence reflected frequent trading activity during the time of marriage and the date of separation. Barton v. Barton, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 235, 715 S.E.2d 529 (2011).

                            Funds in qualified tuition program. - Trial court had to treat funds in qualified tuition program accounts as marital property because the funds were not gifts to the parties' children as the children had no control over the funds while the parties did.

                            Distributions from Corporation. - Trial court erred by failing to classify and distribute as marital property the post-separation, non-salary distributions made from a corporation to the former wife, because the retained earnings of a Subchapter S corporation,
                            upon distribution to shareholders, were marital property. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 748 S.E.2d 352 (2013).

                            Distributions from Limited Liability Company. - Trial court should have classified post-separation distributions to the husband as divisible property; the limited liability company (LLC) was taxed as a partnership, and the two distributions were treated
                            on the LLC's taxes as withdrawals of partnership capital, and thus the distributions were part of the capital of the LLC and belonged to the LLC. Montague v. Montague, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite>                            61, 767 S.E.2d 71 (2014).

                            Spouse's Partial Interest In Business Was Marital Property. - Wife met her burden of showing that the husband's one-third interest in a business was marital, as it was acquired during the marriage and owned on the date of separation, and to the extent
                            there was any evidence as to the appreciation of the husband's interest during the marriage, it was active, not passive; the husband failed to show that any portion of the increase in value was separate property. Porter v.

                            Entireties Property Presumed to Be Gift to Marital Estate. - A presumption of a gift to the marital estate of entireties property is consistent with a public policy to further the intent of both parties as evidenced by their mutual agreement. When one
                            party titles property jointly it is reasonable that the other party expects it to be an addition to marital property. To protect those expectations the property should be classified as marital unless the donor's contrary intent
                            was clearly brought to the attention of the donee. McLeod v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 327 S.E.2d 910, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 331</cite>, 333 S.E.2d

                            Trial court did not err in finding that the entire parcel was marital property as the only relevant evidence that the husband offered to rebut the marital gift presumption was his own testimony. Thus, the husband did not demonstrate that he did not intend
                            to make his interest in the parcel a gift to the marital estate. Warren v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 623 S.E.2d 800 (2006).

                            While there was evidence that plaintiff's grandmother intended checks written to plaintiff and the checks written to defendant husband only as a gift to plaintiff, where the record was void of any evidence concerning plaintiff's intent when placing those
                            checks into property titled in the entireties, the trial court erred by finding that plaintiff did not intend to make a gift to the marital estate. Upon remand, the trial court could consider the individual contributions of
                            separate property if it viewed those contributions as an appropriate factor under subdivision (c)(12). Hunt v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 355 S.E.2d 519 (1987).

                            was pending at the time of the decedent's death and title to the parcels was not acquired in a manner prescribed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(b)(2)</a></cite>;
                            the parcels were marital property, subject to the equitable distribution action, which did not abate upon the death of the decedent. Estate of Nelson v. Nelson, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 633 S.E.2d 124

                            Presumption May Be Overcome by Clear, Cogent and Convincing Evidence. - Under common law, a deed conveying real estate to a husband and wife creates an estate by the entireties. However, title is not absolutely controlling under the Equitable Distribution
                            Act. Joint title merely creates a rebuttable presumption of marital property, which may be overcome by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of the third party donor's contrary intent. Loeb v. Loeb,

                            Where a spouse furnishing consideration from separate property causes property to be conveyed to the other spouse in the form of tenancy by the entireties, a presumption of a gift of separate property to the marital estate arises, which is rebuttable

                            overcome the presumption that the withdrawal of funds was with plaintiff's consent and for marital purposes. Wornom v. Wornom, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 461, 485 S.E.2d 856 (1997).

                            Property Held to be Marital as it Was Not Traceable to Funds from Separate Property. - Competent evidence supported the trial court's finding that the brokerage account was marital property, as the funds stemmed from deposits made during the marriage
                            and the husband was unable to trace the funds back to the funds he inherited from his mother. Comstock v. Comstock, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 304, 771 S.E.2d 602 (2015).

                            Marital property is valued as of the date of the parties' separation. This valuation date is used to determine the equitable distributive share of each party. However, where there is evidence of active or passive appreciation of the marital assets after
                            that date, the court must consider such appreciation as a factor under subdivision (c)(11a) or (12), respectively. Mishler v. Mishler, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 72, 367 S.E.2d 385,

                            The trial court must make a written finding of the passive or active character of post-separation appreciation and in that context the trial court is not required to quantify the post-separation increase on each marital asset as active or passive but
                            must make ultimate findings of fact regarding the character of the total post-separation appreciation. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 575</cite>, 444 S.E.2d 420 (1994).

                            Passive Appreciation in Investment Account. - Any appreciation of an investment account established with the wife's separate funds was purely passive appreciation, and thus, appreciation was the wife's separate property, where the spouses merely met with

                            Increase in Value of Separate Property Due to Active Appreciation Is Marital Property. - Subdivision (b)(2) of this section refers only to passive appreciation of separate property, such as that due to inflation, and not to active appreciation resulting
                            from the contributions, monetary or otherwise, by one or both spouses. The increase in the value of separate property due to active appreciation, which otherwise would have augmented the marital estate, is marital property.

                            An increase in value of separate property due to active appreciation, which otherwise would have augmented the marital estate, is marital property. Thus the marital partnership shares in increases in the value of property it has proportionately "acquired"

                            Leased Car. - The trial court did not err in failing to classify, value, and distribute a leased Porsche as a marital asset, where after the separation date, defendant returned the car to the leasing company and received no money in return because he
                            had no equity in it. Fox v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 404 S.E.2d 354 (1991).

                            Goodwill of Corporation. - The trial court erred in concluding that the goodwill of the corporation was an asset unique to plaintiff and in finding 100% of the goodwill to be a marital asset. Using the uncontested value of the goodwill, the trial court
                            should include that value as part of the valuation of the corporation, calculate the portion of the corporation that is marital at 80%, and distribute accordingly. Tucker v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite>                            785, 440 S.E.2d 315 (1994).

                            Post-separation appreciation of a marital asset is not marital property and therefore cannot be distributed by the trial court. Such appreciation is a distributional factor which the court must consider in resolving what division of the marital property
                            would be equitable. Fox v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 441 S.E.2d 613 (1994).

                            A marital debt is one incurred, during the marriage and before the date of separation, by either or both spouses for the joint benefit of the parties. Huguelet v. Huguelet, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 533, 439

                            Any debt incurred by one or both of the spouses after the date of separation to pay off a marital debt which exists on the date of separation is properly classified as a marital debt. Huguelet v. Huguelet, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite>                            533, 439 S.E.2d 208, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 605</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 392 (1994).

                            Separate debt cannot be distributed; however, the trial court should consider such debt as a factor in deciding what constitutes an equitable division of the marital property.

                            Sufficient evidence supported the finding that a 2012 tax debt was marital where the parties had not separated until 2013. Lund v. Lund, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 779 S.E.2d 175 (2015).

                            Sufficient evidence supported the finding that a credit card debt was marital where the husband testified that the balance of the credit card was $8,895.84 as of a statement date of January 20, 2013, and the parties' date of separation was January 5,
                            2013. Lund v. Lund, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 779 S.E.2d 175 (2015).

                            Trial court properly classified a refinanced mortgage as marital debt where although it was in the husband's name and was incurred after the couple separated, the wife previously acknowledged that because she was under financial strain before the property
                            was listed for sale, the parties refinanced the property to get a lower rate and pay off other marital debt, and the wife's name was left off the refinanced mortgage because her credit score was lower. Sluder v. Sluder, - N.C.

         Federal Income Tax Debt.
        </b> - From approximately 2010 to 2016, plaintiff was the sole wage earner of the family, and during that time, the parties' accrued federal income tax debt totaling $ 62,783.96, including failure-to-pay penalties;
                            competent evidence supported the finding that the federal income taxes owed from 2010 to 2015 were marital, as was a portion of plaintiff's 2016 tax debt, which was otherwise separate. Crago v. Crago, - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d

                            Loan Repayment on Real Property Was All Marital Property. - In equitably distributing parties' real property, on remand, trial court's failure to classify all of a loan repayment as marital was error because the payoff was made during the marriage and
                            the husband failed to establish what portion, if any, of the loan reduction was made prior to the marriage. Ross v. Ross, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 28, 749 S.E.2d 84 (2013).

                            Federal Tax Lien Properly Classified as Marital Debt. - A federal tax lien on a masonry business started by the husband after the parties' marriage was properly determined to be a marital debt since the business profits were for the joint benefit of the
                            parties as husband and wife during the marriage. Glaspy v. Glaspy, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 435, 545 S.E.2d 782 (2001).

                            Payment of Marital Debt. - Trial court erred in failing to find that a former husband's payments on an equity line of credit were divisible property; as the value of the debt at separation exceeded the original pre-marital debt, some portion of the increase
                            in the debt occurred during the marriage. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 748 S.E.2d 352 (2013).

                            the separate property remained separate absent a clear expression of the husband's intent to give the property to the marital estate, and there were no findings indicating such an intent, so the trial court had to determine

                            to perform the very services causing the post-separation appreciation to occur, and here, the wife was bound by the manner in which these distributions to the husband were treated on the company tax returns; the husband performed

                            No Active Appreciation In Value of Medical License. - Where plaintiff was unable to show an increase in the value of defendant's medical license and the evidence tended to show that marital efforts led to the acquisition of the separate property rather
                            than to an active increase in its value, the trial court did not err in refusing to value the active appreciation. Conway v. Conway, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 508 S.E.2d 812

                            property's value classified as marital property. Beightol v. Beightol, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 367 S.E.2d 347, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 171</cite>, 373 S.E.2d

                            Courts have consistently recognized the interest acquired by the nontitled spouse in separately-owned property which increases in value due to the personal efforts of the nontitled spouse. Beightol v. Beightol, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                            58, 367 S.E.2d 347, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 171</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 104 (1988).

                            There is no rule of law which even intimates that a nontitled spouse should be penalized and not allowed a return on his or her investment because the efforts expended were characteristic of those which a caring and loving spouse would have performed
                            in any event. Beightol v. Beightol, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 367 S.E.2d 347, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 171</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 104 (1988).

                            Annuity and Bank Account. - As to annuity and bank account acquired in exchange for separate property of husband, there was no error in the trial court's conclusion that the property remained the separate property of husband, where although husband added
                            wife's name to the bank account and annuity, the record disclosed no evidence of any intention that the funds would not remain his separate property. Manes v. Harrison-Manes, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite>                            170, 338 S.E.2d 815 (1986).

                            Spouse's Disability Benefits. - Where a spouse's disability benefits replaced the spouse's post-separation loss of earning capacity, the benefits were properly classified as separate marital property and was not includable in the property distribution.

                            Insurance Proceeds. - There were no vested rights under the homeowner's insurance policy on the marital residence, as the parties' policy lapsed subsequent to their separation, and defendant took out a new policy on the marital residence in her sole name
                            and it was only after separation that the rights under the policy vested after a tornado damaged the residence; because the premiums on the policy were paid with defendant's assets, the proceeds from the policy were the separate
                            property of defendant, and the trial court erred by concluding otherwise. Robbins v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 770 S.E.2d 723 (2015).

                            Competent evidence supported the trial court's finding that a parcel of real property was a wife's separate property, even though the parcel was acquired during the parties' marriage, because the wife used her separate property to borrow funds to purchase
                            the parcel, the title was placed only in the wife's name, and the rental income from the parcel was used to pay the mortgage and other expenses. Watkins v.

                            Competent evidence supported the trial court's finding that a parcel of real property was a wife's separate property because the wife acquired the property prior to marriage, made the mortgage payments on that property using the rental income generated
                            from the property, and an increase in value of the property was derived through the wife's maintenance and rental of the property to third parties. Watkins v.

                            Where mortgage payments made after separation consisted entirely of defendant's separate property, it would appear that defendant should be credited with at least the amount by which he decreased the principal owed in the marital home. Hunt v. Hunt,

                            Despite fact that the plaintiff and the defendant shared custody of the children by alternating their presence in the marital home during the couple's separation, the court erred in failing to credit plaintiff with paying the entire mortgage debt on the
                            marital property as of the date of separation. Hendricks v. Hendricks, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 386 S.E.2d 84 (1989), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 264</cite>,

                            Separate Property Exchanged for Property Owned as Tenants by the Entireties. - Husband was presumed to have made gift of separate property to marital estate where separate property was exchanged for residential lot which was owned by parties as tenants
                            by the entireties without reservation of interest. Haywood v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. App.</cite> 91, 415 S.E.2d 565, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 553</cite>, 418

                            used to construct husband's and wife's house, the house became the separate property of the husband, absent evidence that the home was taken by the entireties, or that husband made a gift of the house to his wife. Lewis v.

                            Storage of Separate Property in Joint Safety Deposit Box. - Gold coins that were acquired in exchange for the plaintiff's separate property were the plaintiff's separate property. That the plaintiff stored the coins in a joint safety deposit box was not
                            an express contrary intention in the conveyance that the coins be considered to be marital property. Haywood v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. App.</cite> 91, 415 S.E.2d 565, cert. denied,

                            Where a $17,000 BMW was paid with $10,000 given to the husband by his grandmother and deposited by him in a joint bank account, and there was no evidence of any donative intent, absent the deposit, $10,000 of the BMW purchase price should be considered

                            Where an automobile was purchased prior to marriage with a $7,000 down payment by husband, and was titled to both husband and wife, and they both made payments out of separate funds before marriage, and wife continued to make payments during separation,
                            the automobile should not have been included as marital property in divorce proceedings but instead should have been apportioned pro rata to each estate (husband's separate, wife's separate, and marital). Tiryakian v. Tiryakian,

                            separate property of the spouse for whom they may, depending upon circumstances, vest at some time in the future. Hall v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 297, 363 S.E.2d 189 (1987).

                            Money in Separate Account. - In divorce proceeding, where defendant argued that because her father gave money to her, and she deposited it in an account which was solely in her name, that the account should be classified as her separate property, however,
                            the only evidence which was presented indicating donative intent as to this gift was defendant's testimony that "well, my daddy wants me to have this and I'm going to keep it separate," defendant did not meet the burden of
                            showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the account met the definition of separate property. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 442 S.E.2d 533 (1994).

                            wife to repay the home equity line of credit that her husband took out to support the corporation after it found that the corporation was the husband's separate property; an equitable lien or another lawsuit was the proper

                            Inherited Funds Deposited in Joint Account. - Funds deposited into a joint account were the separate property of the husband, where the funds were inherited from the husband's mother even though he stated he intended to use part of the inheritance for
                            marital purposes. Friend-Novorska v. Novorska, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 508, 507 S.E.2d 900 (1998).

                            Valuation of Professional Practice and Goodwill Generally. - In ordering an equitable distribution of marital property, a court should make specific findings regarding the value of a spouse's professional practice and the existence and value of its goodwill,
                            and should clearly indicate the evidence on which its valuations are based, preferably noting the valuation method or methods on which it relied. The court may appoint an additional expert witness under
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, Rule 706, if needed. On appeal, if it appears that the trial court reasonably approximated the net value of the practice
                            and its goodwill, if any, based on competent evidence and on a sound valuation method or methods, the valuation will not be disturbed. Poore v. Poore, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 414, 331 S.E.2d 266, cert. denied,

                            had no goodwill and whether that determination was based on a sound method of valuation, the cause would be remanded for further findings as to the value of plaintiff's business. Draughon v. Draughon,

                            When a professional practice has not been established for a sufficient period to determine goodwill based on comparable past earnings, the capitalization of excess earnings method of valuing goodwill should be used, which is based in part on the amount

                            Applicability of Amendment Making Vested Pension Rights Marital Property. - The 1983 amendment to this section which reclassified vested pension and retirement rights as marital property is applicable only to actions for absolute divorce filed on or after

                            Where an action for divorce is filed before August 1, 1983, all pension and retirement rights are considered separate property for purposes of equitable distribution. Where a divorce action is filed on or after August 1, 1983, vested pension and retirement
                            rights are considered marital property, and the expectation of nonvested rights are considered separate property. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 593, 328 S.E.2d 876

                            "catchall" provision of subdivision (c)(12), of the timing of the action in deciding whether an equal distribution of the marital property would be equitable was essentially a superfluous restatement of its finding under subdivision

                            1982 Agreement Held to Bar Share in Spouse's Military Pension. - Separation agreement entered into on August 2, 1982, which contained no reference to defendant-husband's military pension, but specifically provided that each party was forever barred from
                            any or all rights or claims not therein reserved which arose out of the marital relation and that each party released and relinquished all claims or interest in and to all property of the other, whether then owned or subsequently
                            acquired, barred an award to plaintiff wife under the Equitable Distribution Act of a share in defendant-husband's military pension; the subsequent amendment of the act effective August 1, 1983, to include military pensions
                            as marital property, did not permit plaintiff-wife to avoid the release provisions of the agreement. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 339 S.E.2d 424, cert. denied,

                            In the absence of an agreement of the parties, there are two methods for dividing retirement benefits: (1) award the pension to the employee-spouse and award other marital property of offsetting value to the other spouse under subdivision (b)(3)d, or
                            (2) of this section divide the pension benefits if and when paid, under subdivision (b)(3)c of this section. The first method is known as the present value method, or the immediate offset method, while the second method is

                            In a divorce case, the trial court had authority to order that plaintiff pay defendant part of what plaintiff would have received had he taken retirement pay instead of electing to take Combat-Related Special Compensation disability benefits. The order
                            did not require plaintiff to compensate defendant from his disability pay or classify the disability pay as marital property; although plaintiff had to compensate defendant according to the terms of the order, the funds could

                            required that wife's contributions as a homemaker to the acquisition of at least husband's vested interests in the pension and profit sharing plans of his professional association should have been considered by the court under

                            Prescribed valuation method under this section can be expressed as a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the total period of time the marriage existed (up to the date of separation) simultaneously with the employment which earned the vested pension

                            and thus had achieved the maximum amount of retirement pay permitted regardless of the number of years served, the trial court properly calculated the amount of military retirement pay attributable to the marriage as 21/30
                            or seventy percent (70%), and having determined that an equal division was equitable, properly awarded the wife one-half of this seventy percent (70%), or thirty-five percent (35%), of the defendant's gross military retirement
                            pay, while limiting this award to fifty percent (50%) of the defendant's disposable retired or retainer pay, consistent with the requirement of this section. Lewis v.

                            the trial court had the authority to enter its subsequent order awarding the ex-wife a portion of the ex-husband's military retirement pay; additionally, the appellate court concluded that the retirement provision of the separation

                            but nevertheless was required to wait to receive payment until, if and when, the defendant reached retirement and began receiving benefits. Seifert v. Seifert, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 367</cite>,

                            But Deferral Possible Under Fixed Percentage Method. - Under the fixed percentage method of evaluating pension and retirement benefits, deferral of payment is possible without unfairly reducing the value of the award. The present value of the pension
                            or retirement benefits is not considered in determining the percentage to which the nonemployee spouse is entitled. Moreover, because the nonemployee spouse receives a percentage of the benefits actually paid to the employee
                            spouse, the nonemployee spouse shares in any growth in the benefits. Yet, the formula gives the nonemployee spouse a percentage only of those benefits attributable to the period of the marriage, and that spouse does not share
                            in benefits based on contributions made after the date of separation. Seifert v. Seifert, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 367</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 506 (1987).

                            Fifty-percent Cap Under Fixed Percentage Formula. - Use of the fixed percentage formula prohibits nonemployee spouse from receiving more than 50% of the retirement benefits.

                            In-Kind Distribution, Anticipating Future Benefits, Allowed. - If the marital estate contains adequate property other than pension and retirement benefits, an in-kind or monetary distribution of these assets may be made which takes into account the anticipated
                            pension and retirement benefits. This is impermissible only when the value of the pension or retirement benefits is so disproportionate in relation to other marital property that an immediate distribution would be inappropriate.

                            Benefits of amended pension plan which listed the vesting date prior to the date of separation were properly classified as marital property, and the court was also correct in valuing the pension at its net value, by subtracting the taxes which defendant
                            had paid thereon. Mishler v. Mishler, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 72, 367 S.E.2d 385, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 174</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 111 (1988).

                            Social Security Retirement Benefits Cannot Be Disbursed In Equitable Distribution Award. - Where at separation husband had received monthly Social Security retirement benefits of six hundred seventy-nine dollars ($679.00) and trial court awarded wife
                            four-ninths of husband's Social Security, trial court erred in its award of Social Security benefits to wife since Social Security benefits cannot be disbursed in equitable distribution award. Cruise v. Cruise,

                            If the retirement account is distributed to one spouse, it is equitable to distribute other marital assets to the other spouse to offset the value of the pension, unless such a large distribution of immediate assets would be inequitable. Johnson v. Johnson,

                            The trial court erred by failing to classify a husband's retirement account as either marital or separate property where the husband's partnership agreement provided for vesting and both the husband's and the wife's experts testified about the value of
                            the retirement interest. Fox v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 404 S.E.2d 354 (1991).

                            Trial court erred in a divorce proceeding by classifying a wife's civil service retirement system pension as separate property; the General Assembly had indicated through the plain language of G.S. 50- 20(b)(1) that all pensions were to have been classified
                            as marital property. Rowland v. Rowland, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 237, 623 S.E.2d 287 (2005).

                            Burden Was on Husband to Show What Portion of His Pension Was Separate Property. - When a trial court classified a husband's pension plan solely as marital property, even though a portion of the plan's value was earned prior to the marriage, this was
                            not error, as the husband did not meet his burden of showing what portion of the pension was separate property. Embler v. Embler, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 186, 582 S.E.2d 628 (2003).

                            precisely the calculations mandated by Bishop on a year-by-year basis until there would be no further life expectancy; the trial court's finding of fact setting out that methodology was sufficient to comply with Bishop. Cochran

                            divest a party of property rights she acquired before marriage; the intent to avoid directly affecting a party's rights in separate property can be inferred from the text of the statute, and trial courts are not permitted to
                            disturb rights in separate property in making equitable distribution award orders. Crowell v. Crowell, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 362</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 248 (2019).

                            Right to Equitable Distribution Revived. - Although <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 50-11(e)</a></cite> requires that a claim for equitable distribution be brought prior to the granting of
                            the divorce; where the trial court granted defendant relief from the judgment of absolute divorce and permitted defendant to file her answer, the effect was the same as if the judgment had never been entered, and defendant's
                            right to equitable distribution was revived. Baker v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 444 S.E.2d 478 (1994).

                            Where an executrix appealed the trial court's order, which dismissed the decedent's claims for divorce and equitable distribution against the decedent's wife, the trial court improperly dismissed the executrix's equitable distribution claim on basis that
                            the claim abated upon the decedent's death; as there was no final determination of the claim, it was still pending on the effective date of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1l" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(l)</a></cite>,

                            Lack of Jurisdiction to Order Distribution of North Carolina Uniform Transfers to Minors Act Account. - Trial court lacked jurisdiction to order the distribution of a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act account a husband managed for the parties' child because
                            the child was not joined as a party to the action prior to adjudicating the ownership of the account, which was determined to be marital property; whether the account could be classified and distributed as marital property
                            could only be determined if the child, who owned the legal title to the property, was made a party to the action. Carpenter v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 781 S.E.2d

                            Separation Agreement. - Trial court's equitable distribution order was vacated and remanded because the trial court erred by ordering equitable distribution of the property in contravention of the express terms of the now-court-ordered Separation Agreement
                            and Property Settlement; the Agreement made the parties' intent clear that the provisions regarding ownership of property acquired after husband and wife entered into the 1988 Agreement were to remain unaffected by any later

                            The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering an unequal division of the marital property in favor of the defendant where the trial court concluded that because the defendant had physical custody of the two minor children born of the marriage
                            she had a need to occupy the marital residence and because the plaintiff had an income approximately twice the defendant's income an unequal division in favor of the defendant was equitable. Barlowe v. Barlowe,

                            When evidence is presented from which a reasonable finder of fact could determine that an equal division would be inequitable, the trial court is required to consider the factors set forth in subsection (c), but guided always by the public policy expressed
                            in the act favoring an equal division. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).

                            Burden of Proving That Equal Division Is Not Equitable. - A party desiring an unequal division of marital property bears the burden of producing evidence concerning one or more of the twelve factors in the statute and the burden of proving by a preponderance
                            of the evidence that an equal division would not be equitable. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 770</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 829 (1985); Patton v.

                            Subsection (c) of this section requires an equal division unless the trial court, in its discretion, determines that an equal division would not be equitable. The party seeking a greater than equal share bears the burden of proving that an unequal division
                            would be equitable with respect to the 12 factors listed under subsection (c). Dewey v. Dewey, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 787, 336 S.E.2d 451 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 376</cite>,

                            Where the trial court has accepted an expert's methodology, a party desiring to challenge the methodology must produce other testimony challenging that methodology and set out the prejudicial error which resulted from its use. Sharp v. Sharp,

                            Failure in Burden to Present Evidence. - Where the party claiming a debt to be marital has failed in his burden to present evidence from which the trial court can classify, value and distribute the property, that party cannot on appeal claim error when
                            the trial court fails to classify the property as marital and distribute it. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 387 S.E.2d 181 (1990).

                            Trial Judge Must Consider Distributional Factors. - Where the trial court's valuation of the marital home on the date of separation, the trial judge did not properly consider the post-separation appreciation as a distributional factor under subdivision
                            (c)(11a) or (12). The trial judge must consider those distributional factors raised by the evidence of post-separation appreciation under subdivisions (c)(11a) and (12). Truesdale v. Truesdale,

                            Trial court erred in making no findings regarding the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite> factors and instead concluded only that an equal distribution of the property was
                            equitable. The husband offered evidence in support of his request for an unequal distribution and the trial court was required to make findings of fact under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite>                            regarding any of the factors for which evidence was introduced at trial.

                            Task of a trial court when faced with an action under this section is to equitably distribute the marital property between the litigants. This is evident from the language and the title of the Act. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 770</cite>,

                            Procedure to Be Followed. - In an action for equitable distribution, first the court must classify property as either marital or separate, as defined in subdivisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. Next it must divide the marital property equally,
                            unless it determines that an equal division is not equitable. McLeod v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 327 S.E.2d 910, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 331</cite>,

                        <p>
                            In applying the Equitable Distribution Statute, the trial judge must follow a three step procedure, i.e., (i) classification, (ii) evaluation and (iii) distribution. Cable v. Cable, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite>                            134, 331 S.E.2d 765, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 182</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 856 (1985).

                            Under subsection (c) of this section, equitable distribution applies only to the net value of marital property. This requires the trial court to first ascertain what is marital property, then to find the net value of that property, and finally to make
                            a distribution based upon the equitable goals of the statute and the various factors specified therein. Turner v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 342, 307 S.E.2d 407 (1983); Lawrence

                            To equitably distribute property, it is necessary to identify the property owned, evaluate it and order its distribution. Capps v. Capps, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 318 S.E.2d 346 (1984).

                            In equitably distributing parties' real property, on remand, the trial court properly treated the lot and house as a single asset and made no findings regarding the values or amounts of appreciation in the value of the lot or house separately, as such
                            a method was supported by existing precedent. Ross v. Ross, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 28, 749 S.E.2d 84 (2013).

                            In equitably distributing parties' real property, on remand, the trial court properly calculated the marital and separate portions of the property because it was based on the source of funds that had been contributed by the parties towards it, Ross v.

                            Court Must Weigh Factors and Balance Evidence. - When evidence tending to show that an equal division of marital property would not be equitable is admitted, the trial court must exercise its discretion in assigning the weight each factor should receive
                            in any given case. It must then make an equitable division of the marital property by balancing the evidence presented by the parties in light of the legislative policy which favors equal division. White v. White,

                            Court Not Required to Read Distribution Proposal in Open Court. - Where record established facts from which it reasonably appeared that the parties understood the terms of a proposed distribution of marital property, including the fact that both parties
                            were represented by counsel, that the parties had participated in an equitable distribution hearing, that the major asset was the marital home encumbered by a deed of trust and unpaid tax lien, and that the parties indicated
                            that they either read or understood the terms of the proposed distribution, the trial court was not required to read to the parties in open court the terms of the proposed distribution of marital property. Watson v. Watson,

                            If a court divided the property equally after referring to this section and considering the factors and evidence, any improper reliance upon the statute could only result in harmless error, as the property was in fact divided equally. Eubanks v. Eubanks,

                            Guide as to Which Party Gets What Specific Property. - Once property has been properly designated marital property and valued, and the court has decided in what proportions its value should be divided, there appears to be no other guide than the discretion
                            and good conscience of the trial judge in determining which party gets what specific property. An exception might arise with regard to the marital home or in cases of property of great sentimental value. Andrews v. Andrews,

                            answer was, in effect, a counterclaim. Rabon v. Rabon, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 452, 402 S.E.2d 461 (1991).

                            for divorce requested and reserved a right to equitable distribution, because the remedy of equitable distribution in a divorce case only applied to marital assets, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-21ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-21(a)</a></cite>                            gave a party asserting a claim for such redress 90 days to provide specific information about the property claimed to be subject to equitable distribution; so, to constitute a valid equitable distribution claim, the wife's
                            counterclaim for equitable distribution did not have to state that it applied to the parties' marital assets or property, and the husband was put on notice that the wife asked the court to equitably distribute the parties'

                            McManus, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 334 S.E.2d 270 (1985).

                            Distribution of LLC. - It is undisputed that neither party made any equity contributions to effect the acquisition of the company from the husband's parents; notwithstanding, the trial court's application of the factors and the findings it made supported
                            the distribution of the company to the husband in the equitable distribution order. Montague v. Montague, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 767 S.E.2d 71 (2014).

                            Distribution of Limited Liability Company Property. - Trial court did not err in distributing limited liability company (LLC) property without assigning a value to the LLC interest because it was the trial court's decision to itemize the assets separately
                            from the interest in the LLC; by virtue of the LLC interest, the husband was entitled to a distribution of the remaining assets after dissolution and during the winding up of the LLC's affairs, and the trial court's findings
                            ultimately reflected a reasonable estimate of the parties' interest. Chafin v. Chafin, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 791 S.E.2d 693 (2016), review denied, 795 S.E.2d 219, 2017 N.C.

                            Deed of Trust Executed Without Wife's Consent Attached to Husband's Interest. - When defendants were divorced, the tenancy by the entirety in which their marital home was held became a tenancy in common, and the lien of deed of trust executed by husband
                            without wife's consent attached to defendant husband's one-half undivided interest in the property. Thus when the marital home was distributed pursuant to this section, defendant wife took title in fee simple absolute, subject
                            to plaintiff bank's deed of trust on defendant husband's one-half undivided interest. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 328 S.E.2d 840 (1985).

                            Equitable distribution judgment held incomplete and erroneous in several respects, i.e., failure to identify, classify, value and distribute various bank accounts and household property, failure to find net value of marital estate, failure to make findings
                            pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, failure to properly divide and distribute three tracts of marital real estate, and failure to make conclusions of law. Carr v.

                            Defendant Entitled to Have Court Consider Post-Separation Appreciation. - Although defendant was entitled to have the trial court consider the post-separation appreciation of marital property and the effect the appreciation had on the parties, defendant
                            was not necessarily entitled to a distribution of this post-separation appreciation. Sharp v. Sharp, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 449 S.E.2d 39, cert. denied,

                            Rental Income. - Trial court had classified the rental income generated by the marital home during the separation as divisible property where it determined that the husband's mortgage payments and costs associated with the refinance more than offset any
                            divisible credit that might be due to the wife by virtue of rental income received by the husband. Lund v. Lund, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 779 S.E.2d 175 (2015).

                            Post-Separation Rental Income. - Rental income received from marital property between the date of separation and the date of the equitable distribution action may not be added to the marital estate. Rather than distributing the sums representing the income
                            received from marital property, the trial court must consider the existence of this income, determine to whose benefit the income has accrued, and then consider that benefit when determining whether an equal or unequal distribution
                            of the marital estate would be equitable. Chandler v. Chandler, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 422 S.E.2d 587 (1992).

                            Award of Rental Value of Marital Residence for Post Separation Period. - Trial court did not err in denying the application by the defendant for judgment against the plaintiff for one-half of the fair rental value of the residence of the parties from
                            the time of the separation of the parties through the date of the hearing. Black v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 379 S.E.2d 879 (1989).

                            Post-Separation Appreciation of a Marital Asset Cannot Be Distributed. - Post-separation appreciation of a marital asset, whether passive appreciation or appreciation due to the efforts of an individual spouse, is not marital property and cannot be distributed
                            by the trial court. Gum v. Gum, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 421 S.E.2d 788 (1992).

                            But Should Be Considered as a Distributional Factor. - An increase in the value of a marital asset which occurs after separation of the parties but before the date of the equitable distribution trial should be considered pursuant to subdivisions (c)(11a)
                            or (c)(12) as a distributional factor by the court in its determination of what constitutes an equitable distribution of the marital estate. Chandler v. Chandler, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite>                            66, 422 S.E.2d 587 (1992).

                            Failure to File For Equitable Distribution Because of Misrepresentation. - If plaintiff did not file a claim for equitable distribution before the entry of the divorce judgment due to misrepresentations made by defendant, the trial court is not barred
                            from making an equitable distribution. Where defendant's misrepresentation caused the plaintiff to forego pleading for equitable distribution prior to divorce, the defendant shall be equitably estopped from pleading

                            Death Subsequent to Claim for Equitable Distribution. - Ex-wife's death, which came subsequent to her divorce from plaintiff and which followed the institution of the claim for equitable distribution, did not abate her estate's action for equitable distribution.

                            Plaintiff's actions in dissuading his brother from seeking criminal charges against defendant did not affect the marital economy and therefore was not a proper distributional factor under subdivision (c)(12). Wornom v. Wornom,

                            Voluntary Dismissal of Claim. - Where at the time the plaintiff filed his voluntary dismissal of his claim for equitable distribution, the defendant had filed no pleadings, plaintiff was free to enter his voluntary dismissal of his equitable distribution
                            claim without any notice to the defendant or the defendant's consent. Carter v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 440, 402 S.E.2d 469 (1991).

                            As a warehouse was marital property, payments a husband made toward debts against the warehouse after the parties separated was divisible property; crediting the husband with those payments in an equitable distribution order was in accordance with

                            Credit Not Allowed. - Defendant was not entitled to a credit for debts incurred by defendant for paying a house cleaning bill, grocery bills, a clothing bill, a telephone bill, dry cleaning bills, etc., which debts were incurred after separation. Edwards
                            v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 428 S.E.2d 834, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 172</cite>, 436 S.E.2d 374 (1993).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err by ruling that defendant was not entitled to credit for expenses for utilities and routine maintenance of the marital residence, as he continued to occupy the residence after the parties separated and he did not advance any argument
                            that it would be fair for plaintiff to bear responsibility for his living expenses. Cushman v. Cushman, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 781 S.E.2d 499 (2016).

                            Credit for Debt Payment Properly Given Through Credit to Support Arrearage. - Trial court properly considered the husband's postseparation payments made towards the marital debt and gave him credit for those payments through a credit to his postseparation
                            support arrearage, and properly found that, as a result of this credit, there was no divisible property related to the husband's interest payments. Wirth v. Wirth, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite>                            657, 668 S.E.2d 603 (2008).

                            Unequal Division Upheld. - Where at the time the division of property was to become effective wife had no earnings and was receiving no monies other than those in the form of child support, food stamps, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC),
                            whereas husband had earnings of at least five to six thousand dollars a year, this evidence supported the court's finding that there was a disparity in the parties' income within the meaning of subdivision (c)(1) of this section
                            and tended to show that an equal division of the marital property would not be equitable, and the Court of Appeals could not say that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering an unequal division in favor of wife, particularly
                            in light of wife's poor health. Bradley v. Bradley, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 336 S.E.2d 658 (1985).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Findings of the court that an equal distribution would not be equitable, relying on child custody, household services, and difficulty of evaluation factors, supported the court's discretionary decision to make an unequal distribution. Andrews v. Andrews,
                            <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 338 S.E.2d 809, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 730</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 385 (1986), overruled in part on other grounds, Armstrong v. Armstrong,

                        <p>
                            Although none of the equitable distribution cases suggest that a spouse should take out of the marriage exactly that which was brought into it, plus at least one half of the marital estate, defendant who was awarded just that had no reason to complain.

                            Defendant mother's custody of children, children's residency in family home for most of their lives, their attendance at nearby schools, and defendant's need to occupy the marital residence (i.e., her lower income) were all factors supporting trial court's
                            disproportionate award in equitable distribution proceeding. Hendricks v. Hendricks, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 386 S.E.2d 84 (1989), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 264</cite>,

                            Where the trial court found the presence of a number of distributional factors, including appellee's payment of property taxes, interest, insurance, and repairs on marital property over a period of three years, the trial court did not err in ordering
                            an unequal distribution of marital property. Cobb v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 420 S.E.2d 212 (1992).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's findings were sufficient to support its finding of an unequal division where the plaintiff established five grounds, including the parties disparate income and future earning capacity, present and future pension benefits, the liquidity of
                            the marital assets and tax consequences to each party, and plaintiff's mortgage payments. Mrozek v. Mrozek, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 43, 496 S.E.2d 836 (1998).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering an unequal distribution of the marital property and the ordered division did not result in an obvious miscarriage of justice. Davis v. Sineath, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite>                            353, 498 S.E.2d 629 (1998).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in awarding an unequal division of divisible property because the fact that a former husband's pension, when received, would constitute taxable income was not a tax consequence resulting from the ordered equitable distribution;
                            as for the evidence that the former wife would not be taxed on any gain received upon a sale of the marital home, because there was no evidence that any such sale would be necessary or was imminent, the evidence presented merely
                            a speculative tax consequence as to which the trial court could not make a finding of fact. Cochran v. Cochran, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 679 S.E.2d 469 (2009), review denied,

                        <p>
                            After thorough review of the trial court's order and the 89 findings of fact, including those specific findings related to the unequal division of marital property, the trial court properly considered and balanced the factors upon which evidence was presented
                            supporting an unequal division. Montague v. Montague, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 767 S.E.2d 71 (2014).

                            Where the district court's jurisdiction over equitable distribution was not invoked prior to a judgment for absolute divorce, the superior court was not precluded from exercising jurisdiction over the former husband's action for contribution pursuant

                            Appellate Review. - In an equitable distribution of marital property, a trial court's discretion in determining the equitable distribution of marital property will not be upset on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion; in order to reverse a trial
                            court's equitable distribution judgment on appeal, it must be found that it was unsupported by the evidence. Urciolo v. Urciolo, <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 601 S.E.2d 905 (2004).

                            Order Contained "Ultimate" and "Evidentiary" Findings. - Equitable distribution order appropriately contained both "ultimate" and "evidentiary" findings necessary for the appellate court to review whether the property was equitably divided. Comstock v.
                            Comstock, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 304, 771 S.E.2d 602 (2015).

                            Insufficient Findings to Support Award. - In an equitable distribution of the marital property case, a distribution award to a wife in the amount of $25,000 was reversed where the trial court failed to make any findings as to whether the presumption of
                            an in-kind distribution had been rebutted and whether the husband had sufficient liquid assets to pay the distributive award. Urciolo v. Urciolo, <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 601

                            Although it did not order an in-kind distribution of the parcel of land, the trial court erred because it made no findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding the in-kind presumption and whether it was rebutted, pursuant to
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(e)</a></cite>. Warren v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 623 S.E.2d 800 (2006).

                            Remand of an equitable distribution of property was necessary because (1) the trial court misapplied the burdens of proof as to the classification of credit union accounts; (2) the trial court had to determine whether one spouse met that spouse's burden
                            of proving that the accounts constituted separate property; and (3) the trial court had to make new findings of fact addressing the value of property owned separately by one spouse and identify the statutory basis for its findings
                            regarding the other spouse's use of separate property to buy or fund marital assets. Finney v. Finney, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 736 S.E.2d 639 (2013).

                            Trial court failed to properly distribute a passive loss of value of the parties' one-half interests in two properties because the court did not distribute the loss in accordance with the court's earlier findings. Hill v. Hill,
                            <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 219, 781 S.E.2d 29 (2015).

                            Trial court failed to properly distribute the proceeds of the sale of two marital parcels because the parties only had a half interest in the parcels, but the court distributed the total proceeds. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite>                            219, 781 S.E.2d 29 (2015).

                            Findings Supported. - Regarding payments towards the loan obligation of the parties' adult daughter, the trial court's finding on this issue was supported by the evidence; plaintiff testified that she did not regard the loan as a marital responsibility,
                            and the trial court was the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the evidence. Cushman v. Cushman, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 781 S.E.2d 499 (2016).

                            husband was not barred from asserting compensatory and punitive damage claims against his former wife, a trustee, and a family trust relating to converted Social Security checks and debts separately and apart from an Alamance
                            County domestic case since the claims asserted in the Forsyth County action related to property allegedly accumulated and debts allegedly incurred after the date the husband and wife separated; the extent to which the wife
                            and trustee utilized impermissibly obtained funds to obtain clear title to and then fraudulently transferred the unencumbered former marital residence to the trust had little, if anything, to do with claims between the husband
                            and wife as to the value of that asset and the extent to which and manner in which it was subject to distribution between the parties pursuant to the Equitable Distribution Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20" target="_self">G.S. 50-20</a></cite>                            Jessee v.

                            Findings as to the parties' incomes, liabilities or health and other factors must be made and considered, when evidence concerning them is introduced, in determining whether marital property has been equitably divided. Armstrong v. Armstrong,

                            If, at an equitable distribution hearing, evidence concerning the income and health of the parties tends to show that an equal division of the marital property is inequitable, the trial court must make findings of fact as to these factors. Taylor v. Taylor,

                            income, and that the husband's age and health problems did not prevent the husband from earning income. Squires v. Squires, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 631 S.E.2d 156 (2006).

                            Timing of Professional Career. - The trial court property considered the brief amount of time which elapsed between the opening of defendant's medical practice and the termination of the marriage in determining the extent of plaintiff's contribution to
                            defendant's career potential and development. Conway v. Conway, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 508 S.E.2d 812 (1998).

                            Separate Property to Be Considered in Determining Division of Marital Property. - In determining an equitable division of the marital property, the court must consider the separate property owned by each party at the time the property division is to become
                            effective. Talent v. Talent, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 334 S.E.2d 256 (1985).

                            Considering Source of Property Held by the Entireties is Error. - The trial court could not award to the husband the entire interest in a tree farm on the ground that the source of the interest was the husband's mother as the mother gave an equal interest
                            to the husband and wife, and the parties thereafter titled their separate interests as a tenancy by the entireties. Daetwyler v. Daetwyler, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 502 S.E.2d

                            Court Authorized to Consider Parties' Future Prospects. - The factors listed under subsection (c) of this section indicate that the Legislature intended to grant the trial court the authority to consider the future prospects of the parties, as well as
                            their status at the time of the hearing, in determining whether an equal division of marital assets would be equitable. Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 352 S.E.2d

                            Future Events Not Considered in Determining Marital Property Value. - While trial court had authority on remand to reassess the date of separation value of a logging company, the trial court erred in its consideration of estimated expenses associated
                            with the possible future sale of the logging company since the sale of the logging company was a hypothetical future event uncertain in both occurrence and amount. Crowder v. Crowder, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite>                            677, 556 S.E.2d 639 (2001).

                        <p>
                            The future value of timber, which is planted but will not mature until some years in the future, should not be considered for the purposes of equitable distribution. Cobb v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite>                            382, 420 S.E.2d 212 (1992).

                        <p>
                            No Evidence of Value Presented. - Trial court erred in distributing the passive gains and losses from a wife's savings plan because no evidence was presented on the plan's current value, and no evidence was presented on any passive changes in the plan's
                            value. Burger v. Burger, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 790 S.E.2d 683 (2016).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's unequal distribution of marital property erred because the court (1) made classification and valuation errors, (2) did not find the total value of the net marital estate, (3) erred in finding a 401K plan and a home's equity, which were not
                            valued, were liquid assets, and (4) used an unknown balance on a home equity line of credit and unknown home equity to find an unequal distribution of marital property was equitable. Watson v. Watson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 819 S.E.2d 595 (2018).

                        <p>
                            Increase in Value of Marital Property. - Trial court did not err in considering, as a distributional factor, that the value of the marital property had increased from the date of the separation to the date of the trial and that such increase inured to
                            the benefit of the defendant husband. Atkins v. Atkins, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 199, 401 S.E.2d 784 (1991).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the trial court made findings with respect to the value of the real property as of the date of separation, it made no findings with respect to the value of the tracts as of the date of distribution, notwithstanding some evidence that the values
                            had changed and thus failed to identify and determine the value of the divisible property from the date of separation to the date of distribution and hence could not properly and equitably distribute the divisible property.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although finding that a home, which the parties had contracted to purchase before their separation, but which the husband, after separation, had purchased using marital funds and a mortgage that he obtained in his own name, was properly considered marital
                            property, and that the appreciation in the value of the home was also properly considered marital property, the trial court did not ignore the husband's preservation efforts, but properly considered them under
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite>(11a) in its equitable distribution order. Brackney v. Brackney, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 682 S.E.2d 401 (2009).
                        </p>

                            In equitably distributing parties' real property, on remand, it was improper to allow the wife's post-separation payments to increase her ownership interest in the property itself after the date of separation because it allowed her a greater share of
                            the post-separation appreciation in the property. Ross v. Ross, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 28, 749 S.E.2d 84 (2013).

                            Post-separation appreciation, only refers to that which accumulates to the date of the order for equitable distribution, not in the future. If the rule allowed otherwise, parties would attempt to project the future value of any number of items of marital
                            property, and the equitable distribution trial would become overwhelmingly complicated. Cobb v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 420 S.E.2d 212 (1992).

                            Diminution of Value of Retirement Accounts. - Trial court did not err in not classifying diminution in value of retirement accounts as divisible property under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1b4" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(b)(4)</a></cite>a
                            because of the wife's actions in selling stocks, moving the money to a different firm, and purchasing and trading with the resulting funds; diminution in value was not simply attributable to market forces. Cheek v. Cheek,

                            Consideration of Penalties Caused by Distribution of Thrift Plan. - Evidence was sufficient to require the trial court to make appropriate findings concerning husband's thrift plan before ordering the husband to make a lump sum distributive award from
                            the plan where such a withdrawal would result in the loss of employer contributions or harsh tax consequences. Shaw v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 451 S.E.2d 648 (1995).

                            Subdivision (c)(1) of this section requires the court to consider all debts of the parties, whether a debt is one for which the parties are legally, jointly liable or one for which only one party is legally, individually liable. Geer v. Geer,

                            Marital Debt. - Regardless of who is legally obligated for the debt, for the purposes of an equitable distribution, a marital debt is defined as a debt incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of the parties. Geer v. Geer,
                            <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 353 S.E.2d 427 (1987); Byrd v. Owens, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 418, 358 S.E.2d 102 (1987).

                        <p>
                            The mere fact that a judgment was entered against both spouses is not alone evidence sufficient to require classification of the debt as marital. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 387 S.E.2d 181

                        <p>
                            Pursuant to equitable distribution statute, the trial court is required to classify, value and distribute, if marital, the debts of the parties to the marriage. The party claiming the debt to be marital has the burden of proving the value of the debt
                            on the date of separation and that it was incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of the husband and wife. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 387 S.E.2d 181

                            Distribution of Marital Debts. - The court has the discretion, when determining what constitutes an equitable distribution of the marital assets, to also apportion or distribute the marital debts in an equitable manner. Geer v. Geer,
                            <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 353 S.E.2d 427 (1987).

                        <p>
                            When the court distributes debts, the court must make findings to show it considered all debts of the parties and to identify those which comprise marital debts. Geer v. Geer, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 471,

                        <p>
                            Under this section, the court had the discretion to assign one-half of the marital debts to each party and to then award defendant additional funds sufficient to pay plaintiff's one-half share of the debt. Geer v. Geer,
                            <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 353 S.E.2d 427 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Since the assets and obligations of a husband and wife are reciprocally related, there can be no complete and equitable distribution of their property without also considering and distributing their debt. Byrd v. Owens,

                            Marital Residence. - While paragraph (4) of subsection (c) of this section requires the court to consider the custodial parent's need to occupy the marital residence, it does not require that a party must be a custodial parent in order to be awarded ownership
                            of the marital residence. Geer v. Geer, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 353 S.E.2d 427 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's equitable distribution order erred because the order was internally inconsistent as to a marital home when the court found the home was separate property but found the home's equity was marital property without making necessary findings.

                            Need of spouse to occupy the marital residence, unless it involves a spouse with custody of children, does not relate to the economic condition of the marriage and is not properly considered as a distributional factor under subdivision (c)(12) of this
                            section. Burnett v. Burnett, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 712, 471 S.E.2d 649 (1996).

                        <p>
                            A trial court is not foreclosed from considering the post-separation use of the marital residence in reaching its decision as to whether an equal distribution is equitable. Becker v. Becker, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite>                            606, 364 S.E.2d 175 (1988).

                            A party's exclusive use of marital residence subsequent to date of separation is a relevant distributional factor. Burnett v. Burnett, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 712, 471 S.E.2d 649 (1996).

                            Payment by One of Spouses on Marital Home Mortgage. - Payment by one of the spouses, after the date of separation, on a marital home mortgage is a factor appropriately considered by the trial court pursuant to subdivisions (c)(11a) and (c)(12) in determining
                            what division of marital property is equitable. However, trial court correctly refused to credit husband with any mortgage payments he made after the separation of the parties where they had stipulated that an equal division
                            of property was equitable. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 387 S.E.2d 181 (1990).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trial court did not err by failing to credit plaintiff with reducing mortgage on marital home and paying for taxes and insurance, where the court found that plaintiff made mortgage payments on the property since the date of separation, paid property
                            taxes on the residence for one year, and paid homeowner's insurance premiums for three years, and also considered these facts as a distributional factor. Fox v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite>                            13, 404 S.E.2d 354 (1991).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly considered defendant's post-separation payments toward mortgages as a distributional factor under subdivision (c)(11a) rather than crediting defendant for those payments. Edwards v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite>                            1, 428 S.E.2d 834, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 172</cite>, 436 S.E.2d 374 (1993).

                        <p>
                            There was no error in an unequal distribution of marital property given one of the former spouse's post-separation mortgage payments, which benefited the other spouse, who was awarded the marital home. Fitzgerald v. Fitzgerald,
                            <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 414, 588 S.E.2d 517 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Wife was not given a "double credit" for post-separation mortgage payments, when the court distributed the property to the wife in addition to granting the wife a credit for the payments, because (1) the court put the parties on equal footing as to this
                            debt and asset, and (2) the court permissibly took the increase in the value of the property into consideration in determining equitable distribution. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite>                            219, 781 S.E.2d 29 (2015).

                            Post-Separation Payments for Upkeep on Property Awarded to Spouse Making Payments. - To accommodate post-separation payments for the benefit or use of marital property, the trial court may treat post-separation payments as distributional factors, or provide
                            direct credits for the benefit of the spouse making the payments; it was not an abuse of discretion to deny credits requested for the upkeep of marital property ultimately awarded to the spouse making the payments. Walter v.

                            Consideration of Post-Separation Support Prohibited. - Trial court properly determined equitable distribution because it did not consider the income a husband paid to a wife in excess of his court-ordered obligation to pay post-separation support in its
                            equitable distribution award; the trial court was prohibited from giving the wife any credit for the post-separation support the husband was ordered to pay her, and it gave no consideration to that amount. Miller v. Miller,

                            Waiver of Child Support. - In the absence of a separation agreement, nothing in the statute requires the trial court to take a waiver of child support into account in calculating an equitable distribution. To the contrary, the determination of child support
                            is to be made separately from that of equitable distribution. Wieneck-Adams v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 621, 410 S.E.2d 525 (1991), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 688</cite>,

                            Custody is not an appropriate consideration within this section. The only factors considered "just and proper" within the meaning of the section are those relating to the source, availability, and use by a wife and husband of economic resources during

                            Need of Custodial Parent as Justification for Unequal Distribution. - Under the facts, the need of the parent with custody of the child of the marriage to occupy the marital residence and to use or own household effects alone justified the unequal distribution
                            of marital property, without requiring the trial judge to simply recite the other factors. Patterson v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 343 S.E.2d 595 (1986).

                            Distributional Factors Did Not Include Obligation for the Wife's Child as the Husband Was Not Her Father. - Distributional factor found by the trial court did not address the husband's child support obligations but instead recognized his voluntary assumption
                            of responsibilities and was therefore, properly considered under the catch-all provision of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c12" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)(12)</a></cite> because the

                            an equitable distribution award; it is only after the property has been classified as marital or separate property that the trial court applies the distributional factors found in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite>                            to effect an equitable distribution of marital property and while <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite> contains a number of factors the trial court may consider, G.S. 50-20(c)

                            Value of Contributions by Nonstudent Spouse. - The Legislature gave no guidance on the issue of how to value the direct and indirect contributions of the nonstudent spouse under paragraph (7) of subdivision (c) of this section; thus, as with any statutory
                            factor under subsection (c), it is a matter of discretion what weight the court assigns a particular factor in any given case. Geer v. Geer, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 353 S.E.2d

                            Subdivision (c)(12) Is Limited to Considerations Relevant to Marital Economy. - Only items affecting the marital economy are considered under the first eleven factors of subsection (c). Thus, under subdivision (c)(12), the only other considerations which
                            are "just and proper" within the theory of equitable distributions as expressed by subdivisions (c)(1) to (c)(11) are those which are relevant to the marital economy. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 80</cite>,

                            The only factors which may properly be considered under the catchall provision of subdivision (c)(12) of this section are those factors which are relevant to the marital economy. Marital economy relates to the source, availability and use by the wife
                            and husband of economic resources during the course of the marriage. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 787, 338 S.E.2d 567 (1986).

                            Consideration of Post-Separation Income. - Where post-separation income is not a result of either party's action, the income can be considered as "any other distributional factor" under subdivision (c)(12). Chandler v. Chandler,
                            <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 422 S.E.2d 587 (1992).

                            Monies Paid by Husband to Wife After Separation Were Advances. - Trial court correctly treated the $45,457 paid to wife as a distributional factor under subdivision (c)(11) or (12) of this section. Interspousal gifts under subdivision (b)(2) of this section
                            do not become the separate property of the recipient spouse unless the donor expresses the intention to make a gift. This rule is applicable to an even greater extent after the parties have separated. As a matter of public
                            policy, if trial courts are not allowed to consider such payments as distributional factors, then the spouse with possession of marital property during the period between separation and the order of equitable distribution may
                            seek to hold this marital property exclusively. Cobb v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 420 S.E.2d 212 (1992).

                            When Fault May Be Considered. - The general rule is that marital fault or misconduct of the parties which is not related to the economic condition of the marriage is not germane to a division of marital property and should not be considered. However,
                            fault which is related to the economic condition of the marriage may be considered. Spence v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 8, 348 S.E.2d 819 (1986).

                            Fault or misconduct which dissipates or reduces marital property for nonmarital purposes is just and proper to consider under subdivision (c)(12) of this section. Spence v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 8,

                            Misconduct during the marriage which dissipates or reduces the value of marital assets for nonmarital purposes may properly be considered under this section, because it is consonant with the essential philosophy of equitable distribution. Smith v. Smith,

                            Marital fault or misconduct which does not adversely affect the value of marital assets is not a just and proper factor within the meaning of subdivision (c)(12). Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 80</cite>, 331

                            Sanctions for Marital Misconduct That Has No Economic Impact on Marital Estate. - Marital misconduct that has no resulting economic impact on the marital estate may nonetheless have other consequences; for instance, the spouse can be sanctioned for the
                            willful obstruction of an equitable distribution proceeding, directed to pay for costs incurred for the return of the other spouse's separate property, or be subject to an inspection for the purpose of inventory and valuation.

                            Removal of Spouse's Separate Property. - The trial court properly considered evidence that the defendant wife removed or disposed of the plaintiff husband's separate property as a non-statutory distributional factor where (1) the wife entered the dwelling
                            of the husband after separation and removed approximately $4,000 worth of property, including all the furniture in the house with the exception of a bed, chair, and kitchen table, (2) she then entered the home again at a later
                            date and removed such items as food, guns, a leather coat, frozen meats, and personal items of the plaintiff, and (3) she even hauled off their 1971 Chevy pickup truck and sold it for $400. Glaspy v. Glaspy,

                            Removal of Property Awarded to Spouse Who Removed It. - Wife's removal of truckloads of marital property from the marital home immediately pursuant to the parties' separation constituted marital misconduct, but the trial court erred in considering this
                            as a distributional factor; as the property removed was awarded to the wife, there was no economic effect on the marital estate. Walter v. Walter, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 723,

                            Failure to comply with discovery orders, or misconducting oneself during the course of litigation may not be considered as a factor in determining the distribution of marital property.

                            When the failure to assist in the compilation and valuation of marital property during litigation causes one party to incur additional expenses, the court may consider such a purely financial consideration in making its distributive award. This is equivalent
                            to the proper consideration of marital misconduct which is related to the economic condition of the marriage as a factor in making the distributive award. Shoffner v.

                            Parties' Premarital Relationship. - Recitation in the findings of the extramarital nature of the parties' premarital relationship suggested that the trial judge may have improperly considered fault in making the distribution; however, where the husband
                            did not assert, nor was there anything to indicate that he was prejudiced by, this consideration, the error, if any, was harmless. McIver v. McIver, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 116,

                            Child Support and AFDC Are Not Income. - Since the amounts received by a spouse in the form of child support and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) are for the benefit and support of the parties' children, they are not income within the meaning
                            of subdivision (c)(1) of this section. Bradley v. Bradley, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 336 S.E.2d 658 (1985).

                            Working Outside Home and Participating in Child-Rearing and Homekeeping. - Under subdivision (c)(12) of this section, it is within the trial court's equitable powers to consider that one spouse worked outside the home and participated in child-rearing
                            and homekeeping, while the other spouse only participated in child-rearing and homekeeping. Dorton v. Dorton, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 667, 336 S.E.2d 415 (1985).

                            Consideration of Unvalued Inheritance and Fact of Appraisal Held Error. - Where there was no evidence to support the value of the inheritance the husband received from his mother, it was error for the trial court to consider as a distributional factor
                            under subdivision (c)(1) of this section that the husband had received an inheritance of "significant value" from his mother's estate; furthermore, since the party claiming property to be marital has the burden of presenting
                            evidence on the value of such property, it was error to consider as a distributional factor that the party with the burden of proof had the property appraised and the appraiser testified as to the value of the property. Atkins

Montague v. Montague, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite>                            61, 767 S.E.2d 71 (2014).

                            Insurance Proceeds. - Given that not all findings of fact were supported and insurance proceeds for the marital residence were incorrectly classified as marital instead of separate, the unequal distribution was reversed; on remand the trial court was
                            to reconsider the distributional factors, including whether plaintiff was required to reimburse defendant for the separate property, as plaintiff was awarded the marital residence, and the fact that defendant did use the funds
                            for repairs to the martial residence might be a distributional factor in her favor. Robbins v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 770 S.E.2d 723 (2015).

                            Bound by tax returns. - Trial court erred in classifying the post-separation distributions from a partnership between a husband and his father to the husband because the parties were bound by the characterization of the distributions on the partnership's
                            income tax returns. Blair v. Blair, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 474, 818 S.E.2d 413 (2018).

                            Commingled Account. - Because it is undisputed that plaintiff was entitled to half of defendant's retirement benefits, defendant's retirement fund consisted of a commingled account that included funds belonging to plaintiff. Cushman v. Cushman,

                            Decrease in Separate Property Through Activities Which Increased Marital Estate. - Where the marital estate was increased due to activities which decreased the value of wife's separate property, this decrease in separate property through depreciation
                            related to the economy of the marriage; thus, the court properly considered this depreciation under subdivision (c)(12) when dividing the marital property. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite>                            787, 338 S.E.2d 567 (1986).

                            Passive Appreciation and Depreciation. - Husband did not show a trial court erroneously classified "active increases" in marital debt as divisible property for post-separation payments because (1) the husband did not identify any erroneously classified
                            divisible property, and (2) the only property classified and distributed as divisible was by passive decreases. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 219, 781 S.E.2d 29 (2015).

                            Disregarding Family Corporation Held Error. - Action of the trial court in equitable distribution action in disregarding the corporate entity of a family corporation on the grounds that the corporation was a "sham," and in distributing the assets of the
                            corporation as marital property, but holding defendant personally liable for $23,000 worth of notes and deeds of trust which she had executed, apparently in the name of the corporation, after the parties separated, constituted
                            reversible error, where several of the reasons cited by the trial court for disregarding the corporate entity were unsupported by the evidence or were irrelevant. Dorton v. Dorton, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                            667, 336 S.E.2d 415 (1985).

                            Disregarding Parties' Stipulation Was Error. - Because the parties had stipulated that the townhome was the wife's separate property and that its value was $186,000.00, the trial court erred by classifying a portion of it as marital and attempting to
                            value it based only upon the balance of a marital debt as of the date of separation. Clemons v. Clemons, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 828 S.E.2d 501 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in forbidding either party from receiving a commission or broker's fee on the sale of the marital home (the order being directed primarily at defendant, a licensed real estate broker), since if the parties could sell the home by
                            themselves, without paying a real estate commission, then the net proceeds of the sale would be greater and there would be more marital property for equitable distribution. This was an equitable factor that the trial court
                            could consider. Dorton v. Dorton, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 667, 336 S.E.2d 415 (1985).

                            Attribution of husband's payment of $3,000 debt accumulated by wife and minor children for necessities after date of separation to husband's continuing obligation to support his minor children did not constitute an improper use of child support to inflate
                            the income of either party in violation of subsection (f) of this section, but, rather, was a determination that the debt was incurred to purchase necessities after the parties' separation. Beightol v. Beightol,

                            Failure of Court to Find Distributional Factors. - In determining an appropriate distribution of the marital property, the trial court erred by failing to consider the following factors: (1) evidence that the husband paid homeowner's insurance premiums
                            on the marital home between the date of separation and the date of the trial should have been considered as a distributional factor under subdivision (c)(11a); (2) evidence that the husband was primarily responsible for maintaining
                            and preserving the marital property between the date of separation and the date of trial also should have been considered as a distributional factor under subdivision (c)(11a); and (3) evidence that the wife earned a larger
                            income than the husband should have been considered by the trial court as a distributional factor under subdivision (c)(1). Atkins v. Atkins, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 199, 401 S.E.2d
                            784 (1991).

                        <p>
                            It was error for a trial court to order an equitable distribution of divorcing parties' marital property under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(b)(2)</a></cite> or (4) because the court
                            did not make written findings supporting its determination, it did not indicate whether an equal division was an equitable division, and it could not be determined whether the court had properly valued, classified, and distributed
                            the property. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 518</cite>, 631 S.E.2d 114 (2006).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although the weight given to any factor is in the trial court's discretion, the trial court did not make findings on all of the distributional factors upon which evidence was presented; for example, the trial court earlier found that defendant suffered
                            from severe anxiety, clinical depression, multiple seizures and short-term memory loss, but the trial court did not make any findings of fact regarding the factor of the physical and mental health of both parties, and on remand,
                            the trial court was to make findings of fact upon all of the factors upon which evidence was presented. Robbins v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 770 S.E.2d 723 (2015).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant did not introduce evidence establishing the amount of the post-separation payments made from his separate funds, and thus the trial court did not err by making no findings specifically valuing or distributing these payments, and the distribution
                            was affirmed. Cushman v. Cushman, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 781 S.E.2d 499 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court's unequal distribution in favor of a husband was vacated, and the case was remanded, because its findings that the husband rebutted the presumption favoring an equal distribution of marital property did not comply with the statute; the court
                            of appeals was unable to discern how much weight the trial court gave to the factor of the wife's income and earning capacity. Carpenter v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 1,

                        <p>
                            Trial court's equitable distribution order erred because (1) nothing supported the court's valuation of a vehicle, as the sum used to pay off the vehicle loan years earlier was no evidence of value, and (2) the court did not value a 401K plan found to
                            be marital property. Watson v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 819 S.E.2d 595 (2018).

                            Findings Not Required. - Given that defendant agreed at the trial level that an equal division of the marital estate would be equitable, the trial court was not required to make findings demonstrating its consideration of the distributional factors. Cushman
                            v. Cushman, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 781 S.E.2d 499 (2016).

                            Statutory Factors Did Not Have to Be Considered. - Trial court did not err by determining reimbursement to a wife was equitable, even though the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite>                            factors were not considered, as the post-separation mortgage payments made by the wife while the husband was in exclusive possession of the marital home were not "divisible property," and the trial court was not required by
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite> to consider the statutory factors; the trial court was only required to make a "reasoned decision."

                            But a court's authority to make distributive awards is limited, and a court may not enter a distributive award that will be treated as ordinary income under the Internal Revenue Code.

                            Findings on Ability to Pay Distributive Award Required. - On the record it could not be determined how the trial court evaluated the husband's ability to pay the monthly payment on the distributive award, and on remand it was possible that the monthly
                            amount might be revised if the interest rate or term of payment was revised; additional findings regarding the husband's ability to pay were required. Porter v. Porter, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite>                            321, 798 S.E.2d 400 (2017).

                            Distributive awards for periods longer than six years, if necessary, should be crafted to assure completion of payment as promptly as possible. This will serve both statutory goals: Affording the recipient's share nonrecognition treatment under the Internal
                            Revenue Code, and fairly wrapping up the marital affairs as quickly and certainly as possible. Lawing v. Lawing, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 344 S.E.2d 100 (1986).

                            Inability to Pay Award With Six Years. - Burden was upon the husband to make a showing that legal or business impediments, or some overriding social policy, prevented completion of the distribution within the six-year period, but he made no showing and
                            no argument regarding how the distributive payments should be done or over what time period; both parties agreed that the husband would be unable to pay the distributive award immediately or even within six years, so an extended
                            payment schedule was necessary, and remand was required. Porter v. Porter, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 321, 798 S.E.2d 400 (2017).

                            Seven Year Payment Schedule Held Erroneous. - Where the court's decision to award the marital residence to the plaintiff wife resulted in property having a net value of $78,978.00 being distributed to her, while property passing to the defendant husband
                            had a net value of only $13,140.63, the distributive award of $23,706.82 which the court ordered the wife to pay to the husband was within the authority vested in the court by subdivision (e) of this section; however, where
                            the payment of the distributive award would not become due for more than seven years after the termination of the marriage, and the trial court made no findings which would permit completion of the payment of the distributive
                            award beyond six years from the date the parties' marriage was terminated, that portion of the order providing for the distributive award would be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings. Harris v. Harris,

                            Trial court erred in failing to make findings concerning the possible financial and tax consequences to a husband of paying a distributive award to the wife within 90 days, as such findings were required under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite>;

                            The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering an unequal distribution of the marital estate in favor of the defendant/husband, the effect of which was that he received $100,000 more than he would have received under an equal division and resulted
                            in a split between the couple of their four Hallmark stores, nor was it error for the court to consider certain post-separation payments made by him, taxes incurred as a result of the forced sale of a residence, financial losses,
                            and the allocation of associated debts as distributional factors. Khajanchi v. Khajanchi, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 537 S.E.2d 845 (2000).

                            Real Property. - While a hunting land and lodge had the potential to be a money-making business, neither party had the financial ability to "buy-out" the other party's share by paying a sizeable distributive award, thus, while economically desirable to
                            keep the land and hunting lodge together, such a division was not possible, and the real estate had to be substantially split in order to achieve an equitable distribution. Edwards v. Edwards,

                            Judgment creditor could execute on a husband's interest in certain real property, despite a judge's oral directive directing a clerk to transfer the interest to the husband's former wife, because the oral directive was ineffective as no judgment was entered.

                            When a trial court issued an oral directive to a clerk to transfer a husband's interest in certain real property, which was purportedly sufficient in and of itself to transfer the husband's interest, the directive did not extinguish a judgment creditor's
                            lien against the interest because the directive was never recorded. Dabbondanza v. Hansley, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 791 S.E.2d 116 (2016).

                            Reimbursement of Post-Separation Payments. - While the trial court erred in categorizing a wife's post-separation payments of a mortgage while a husband was in exclusive possession of the martial home as a distribution of divisible property, as the payments
                            pre-dated the amendment to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1b4d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(b)(4)(d)</a></cite> and were not divisible property, the error did not require remand as the

                            her paycheck into the joint account to help pay household bills; therefore, the trial court did not err by not assigning value to the husband's allegation that the wife converted marital funds. Petty v. Petty,

                            Distributive Award is a Sum Certain and Does Not Include Gains and/or Losses. - Retirement account award has to include gains and losses on the prorated portion of the benefit vested at the date of separation; however, a distributive award is a sum certain
                            and does not include gains and/or losses. Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 591 S.E.2d 560 (2004).

                            Distributive award that the trial court entered in favor of an ex-wife after her former husband died was not part of the husband's estate, and the trial court properly ordered the husband's personal representative to pay the award before she paid claims
                            against the estate. Painter-Jamieson v. Painter, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 594 S.E.2d 217 (2004).

                            Although it was likely that a distributive award in lieu of in-kind distribution was proper in light of the far greater involvement of one spouse than the other in a family-owned business, the trial court would have to provide more detailed findings to
                            support its decision against in-kind distribution; the order already adequately identified sources of payment for such an award where it referenced both the proceeds of a refinancing of the former marital home and income received
                            from the family business. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 607 S.E.2d 331 (2005).

                            Distribution of Diminution in Value to Party Not Receiving Asset. - Since the trial court conducted the proper analysis under this section and its conclusions were supported by findings that were, in turn, supported by competent evidence, the trial court
                            did not abuse its discretion by distributing the diminution in value of a home to the wife despite the fact that the husband received the asset. Zurosky v. Shaffer, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite>                            219, 763 S.E.2d 755 (2014).

                            North Carolina law did not permit a trial court to consider a party's future inheritance under the will of a person not yet deceased as a distributional factor for purposes of equitable distribution. As such, the trial court abused its discretion by basing
                            a portion of its award on evidence that the husband would possibly inherit the property as set out in his father's will; therefore, because the appellate court was unable to ascertain the extent to which the trial court based
                            its award on the husband's future inheritance, the appellate court reversed and remanded the order for entry of a new order in accordance with the opinion. Petty v.

                            in a divorce action where the wife filed the motion on the day before the judgment was signed by the judge and filed, at which point the judgment became final pursuant to G.S. 1A-1-58; therefore, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 50-11(e)</a></cite>                            did not destroy the wife's right to seek equitable distribution as the motion was filed before an absolute divorce was granted.

                            Trial Court Has No Jurisdiction After Notice Of Appeal. - Trial court erred in entering an order permitting a wife to pursue a judgment against a husband pending appeal of an equitable distribution order for the distributive payments that were past due
                            because it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enter the order; although an equitable distribution distributive award is theoretically a judgment directing the payment of money, which is enforceable during the pendency
                            of an appeal unless the appealing spouse posts a bond pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-289" target="_blank">G.S. 1-289</a></cite>, the trial court does
                            not have jurisdiction after notice of appeal to determine the amount of periodic payments which have come due and remain unpaid during the pendency of the appeal and to reduce that sum to an enforceable judgment. Romulus v.

                            with interest, but he was free to pay the balance sooner and avoid the payment of additional interest. Porter v. Porter, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 321, 798 S.E.2d 400 (2017).

                            Distributive Award Proper. - Contrary to the husband's argument, the trial court's order distributing several business holdings to the wife in a divorce case and in ordering the wife to pay a distributive award of $220,542 was proper despite the husband's
                            claim that the wife did not possess any business experience or acumen; the record revealed that the business interests distributed to the wife did not require the active operation or management by the wife. Five businesses
                            should have been distributed to one person in order to maximize the value of the companies. Wirth v. Wirth, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 668 S.E.2d 603 (2008).

                            ability to pay the award, particularly as previously received retirement funds were more than the distributive award. Plummer v. Plummer, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 680 S.E.2d 746 (2009).

                            Wife presented evidence that diamond and ruby earrings were appraised at $400.00 and the cameo ring's value was approximately $100.00, and there was evidence presented that the wife possessed the jewelry a few months before the parties separated, but
                            did not take the jewelry with her after they separated. Therefore, the trial court's findings of value regarding the jewelry and assigning that value to defendant during distribution of the property was supported by the evidence.

                            did not abuse its discretion by distributing the funds held in the bank account to the husband. Petty v. Petty, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 192, 680 S.E.2d 894 (2009), review denied

                            Trial court ordered an in-kind distribution of the marital funds, and the husband did not rebut the presumption that an in-kind distribution of the cash and checks would be equitable, and thus the trial court was not required to consider the distributive
                            award factors, including whether the husband had sufficient assets to pay the award; as he was ordered to pay a certain amount of the proceeds in his possession, the same liquidity concerns raised with distributive awards were
                            not present in this case. Sauls v. Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 371, 763 S.E.2d 328 (2014).

                            Wife's distributive award did not err because the court made sufficient findings to indicate the court's basis for entering a distributive award and did not abuse the court's discretion by ordering a distributive award based on the distributional factors
                            the court considered. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 219, 781 S.E.2d 29 (2015).

                            Trial court did not improperly fail to consider a husband's post-separation payments on a marital home because the payments did not exceed the reasonable rental value of the home, in which the husband lived, which the husband did not pay. Smith v. Smith,

                            Former husband failed to show that a trial court in distributing the husband's Federal Employees Retirement Savings benefits abused its discretion by distributing the present value of the survivor's benefit to the wife, and the present value of the retirement

                            Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in ordering defendant to make a distributive award of $ 120,000; defendant had obvious liquid assets from which to make a distributive award, consisting primarily of life insurance proceeds from the death
                            of the defendant's ex-husband, the trial court found there was $ 841,784.00 remaining in the account as of the parties' date of separation, and given defendant's expenses, it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that
                            there was at least $ 200,000 remaining. Crago v. Crago, - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 700 (2019), review denied, 838 S.E.2d 181, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 166.

                            Separate Property Improperly Distributed. - Trial court ordered plaintiff to liquidate certain real properties to pay down the distributive award; because this unquestionably disturbed plaintiff's rights in her separate property, the trial court's actions
                            amounted to an impermissible distribution of that property, but this finding was not intended to limit the trial court's civil contempt power should she fail to comply with the order, at which time all of her assets could be

                            Subsection (a) of this section effectively provides for the "freezing" of the marital estate as of the date of the parties' separation, and marital assets, distributed thereafter, are valued as of that date; attempts by one or both spouses to deplete
                            the marital estate or dispose of marital property after the date of separation but before distribution may be considered by the court when making the division, and any conversion of marital property for individual purposes
                            may be charged against the acting spouse's share. Sharp v. Sharp, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 351 S.E.2d 799 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Net Value Used to Determine Equitable Distribution. - In determining what distribution of the property is equitable, the court must use the net value of the property rather than its fair market value. Wade v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite>                            372, 325 S.E.2d 260, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 612</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 616 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Net value, rather than fair market value, is the proper measure for valuing marital property for equitable distribution. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 12, 327 S.E.2d 283 (1985).

                        <p>
                            The division of marital property is to be accomplished by using the net value of the property, i.e., its market value, if any, less the amount of any encumbrance serving to offset or reduce market value. Talent v. Talent,
                            <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 334 S.E.2d 256 (1985).

                            Date of Separation to Be Used in Valuing Property. - The trial court did not err in failing to consider the current fair market value of all marital assets. Subsection (b) of this section provides that for purposes of equitable distribution, marital property
                            shall be valued as of the date of the separation of the parties. Fox v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 404 S.E.2d 354 (1991).

                            Since the trial court was required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-21ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-21(b)</a></cite> to find the value of the IRA as of the date of separation, the court did not err by doing so. The
                            husband's evidence was more properly considered as a distributional factor under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite>. Warren v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite>                            509, 623 S.E.2d 800 (2006).

                            Burden of Proof. - It was the wife's burden of proof to value companies to have the property classified as marital or divisible property, and she failed to meet her burden, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the husband's motion
                            in limine to prohibit the introduction of evidence regarding these assets; the trial court did account for these assets in its unequal division. Montague v. Montague, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite>                            61, 767 S.E.2d 71 (2014).

                            Appreciation Is Factor to Be Considered. - Post-separation appreciation of marital property itself is neither marital nor separate property. Such appreciation must instead be treated as a distributional factor under subdivision (c)(11a) or (12). Truesdale
                            v. Truesdale, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 445, 366 S.E.2d 512 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Where there is evidence of active or passive appreciation of marital assets after the date of separation, the court must consider the appreciation of the assets as a factor under subdivisions (c)(11a) or (12) of this section. Fox v. Fox,
                            <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 404 S.E.2d 354 (1991).

                            Diminution in Value of Marital Property. - Trial court found both parties at fault in the diminution in value of the marital residence due to failure to maintain and repair it; the trial court therefore erred in failing to divide the diminution in value
                            between the parties. Robertson v. Robertson, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 605 S.E.2d 667 (2004).

                            Arbitrator's finding that the diminution in value of a husband's vehicle was properly within the definition of divisible property, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1b4" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(b)(4)</a></cite>,
                            was not an evident miscalculation or mistake under the Family Law Arbitration Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a03s50-55" target="_self">G.S. 50-55</a></cite>, because the basis for the vehicle's decrease in value could
                            not be attributed to the actions of one spouse and occurred after the date of separation; the arbitrator made the uncontested finding that the post-separation decrease in the value of the vehicle was $13,000. Barton v. Barton,
                            <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 235, 715 S.E.2d 529 (2011).

                            Failure to Classify Corporation's Loss in Value as Divisible Property was Error. - Trial court's failure in a divorce case to classify a corporation's loss in value as divisible property was error because, although the husband was the sole stockholder
                            of the corporation, the trial court specifically stated that it was impossible to determine what portion of the loss was due to the husband's postseparation management and what part was due to forces beyond his control; thus,
                            the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1b4a" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(b)(4)(a)</a></cite> presumption was unrebutted. Wirth v. Wirth, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 668

                            When Separation Held to Occur. - Where at all times prior to December 26, 1983, the relationship between plaintiff and defendant was of such a character as to give the appearance that they were husband and wife living together and that they held themselves
                            out to be such, their separation, as that term is defined by case law, did not occur until December 26, 1983. Hall v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 297, 363 S.E.2d 189 (1987).

                            Failure of judge to value marital property as of date of separation was error prejudicial to wife. By looking only to funds in husband's account at time of equitable distribution hearing, rather than at time of separation, judge failed to properly trace
                            marital property. Account in question was established by husband after separation and before hearing, and funds deposited to account came from three sources, two of which were part marital and part separate and one of which
                            was wholly marital. Willis v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 546, 358 S.E.2d 571 (1987).

                            The trial court erred in considering post-separation events in determining the value of the marital corporation where the case arose prior to the 1997 amendments to the Equitable Distribution Act; events which occurred following the date of separation
                            were to be considered only as distributional factors under this section while events which occurred prior to the separation - for example, the wife's freezing the equity line which, for all practical purposes, destroyed the
                            relationship between the marital corporation and its major client - could be considered in valuation of the property. Offerman v. Offerman, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 289, 527 S.E.2d

                            Trial Court Is Required to Value Property Stipulated to Be Marital. - When parties to an equitable distribution action make a valid stipulation that certain property is to be classified as marital property, the trial court is nonetheless required to value
                            and distribute that property. Byrd v. Owens, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 418, 358 S.E.2d 102 (1987).

                            Property Must Be Valued Before It Is Distributed. - Subsection (c) of this section requires the trial court to determine what is marital property, then to find the net value of the property, and finally to make an equitable distribution of that property;
                            thus, where the court made some findings and conclusions regarding marital property, but did not place a value on the marital home, its order that the marital home be sold for not less than $140,000 was at least premature,
                            as the court had not placed a value upon the marital property. Soares v. Soares, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 357 S.E.2d 418 (1987).

                            No Requirement to Assign Monetary Value to Medical License. - Having classified the husband's medical license as separate property and considered it as having "very substantial value" in making equitable distribution, the trial court did not err in refusing
                            to assign it a monetary value. Conway v. Conway, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 508 S.E.2d 812 (1998).

                            This section does not require the trial court to place a monetary value on any distributional factor; this would be an unnecessary burden upon the trial court. Gum v. Gum, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 421

                            No Credit for Payments on Marital Home. - Once the residence was distributed to the ex-wife in the interim distribution order, any payments she made on the home were to her benefit, and she did not need to be credited with them; the trial court did not
                            abuse its discretion in assigning a value to the marital residence and declining to assign a value to the ex-wife's post-interim distribution payments. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite>                            280, 750 S.E.2d 25 (2013).

                            Dual Classification and Valuation. - Although evidence supported judge's dual classification of marital home, in that the home was acquired in part by separate estate and in part by marital estate, judge erred by assigning a combined marital and separate
                            property value when he distributed property. Trial judge must divide the equity based on the proportion invested by marital and separate estates. Willis v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite>                            546, 358 S.E.2d 571 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Mortgage payments are acquisitive, not appreciative. Active/passive distinction concerning appreciation has no utility when property has dual classification (i.e., was acquired in part with separate property and in part with marital property). Each estate,
                            marital and separate, is entitled to a proportionate return on its investment whether appreciation is active or passive. Willis v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 546, 358 S.E.2d

                            Valuation of Property After Separation Held Proper. - There was no error when the trial court based its distribution of the marital property on evidence of values of the marital property assigned after the date of the parties' separation, where although
                            plaintiff and defendant were separated on December 24, 1984, the court valued the parties' pensions as of December 31, 1984, defendant failed to demonstrate that either of the parties made any additional contributions, or that
                            any additional interest had accrued to the retirement plans during the seven day interval between the parties' date of separation and the date of valuation. Shoffner v. Shoffner, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite>                            399, 371 S.E.2d 749 (1988).

                            Items Charged on Credit Card. - Court erred in its equitable distribution judgment by including the gross fair-market value of those marital properties which had an outstanding credit card balance and then failing to credit plaintiff for the debt; however,
                            since plaintiff was awarded all of the items charged on the credit card in the property division award, the error was not prejudicial. Hendricks v.

                            Value of Truck and Lease of Truck. - Trial court did not commit error in assigning a value to, and including as marital property of the parties, both the net fair market value of the truck, and the net present fair market value of a lease of truck; the
                            truck and the lease were two separate items of property and, therefore, the trial judge properly valued the truck and the lease as separate assets. Black v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite>                            220, 379 S.E.2d 879 (1989).

                            Value of Growing Timber. - Trial judge correctly included the actual value of the land and timber at the date of separation. Because neither party presented evidence of appreciation, if any, between the time of separation and the order for equitable distribution,
                            the trial judge was not required to find the presence of this distributional factor. Cobb v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 420 S.E.2d 212 (1992).

                            Insufficient Evidence to Reach Value of Retirement Account. - Without the amount of the monthly pension as of the date of separation, the case law computation could not be completed, and the trial court correctly found that it lacked sufficient evidence
                            to attempt to value the ex-husband's retirement; this flaw could not be corrected with a post-trial memorandum that relied on websites and other materials not before the trial court as competent evidence, because clever arguments
                            cannot atone for a fatal deficiency in the evidence presented to the trial court. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 280, 750 S.E.2d 25 (2013).

                            Trial court's revised equitable distribution on remand was not an abuse of discretion because it was not an abuse of discretion to find a wife's testimony on the value of a marital residence not credible, or not to value and distribute an increase in
                            the home's value between separation and distribution, as no appraiser opined as to this divisible property's value on the date of distribution, and the wife's value estimates were speculative. Lund v. Lund,

                            Valuation Upheld. - Trial court's valuation of a 1995 Harley-Davidson motorcycle was upheld on appeal where the husband never objected to the fair market value that the trial court placed on the machine, and the trial court had made sufficient findings
                            of fact that showed the motorcycle had a net equity value of $1,952.00. Urciolo v. Urciolo, <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 601 S.E.2d 905 (2004).

                            Trial court did not err in valuing the real property portion of the marital property between a former husband and former wife because the only evidence the husband used to contradict the trial court's findings on the valuation of the land was his own
                            testimony, which consisted of unsupported statements; those bald, self-serving statements did not constitute a basis for concluding that the trial court abused its discretion in the valuation. Troutman v. Troutman,

                            Trial court did not err in determining that an increase in a husband's dental practice after the date of the parties' separation was divisible property, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1b4a" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(b)(4)(a)</a></cite>,
                            because the trial court could not determine the cause of the post-separation increase in value and the husband failed to present evidence to rebut the statutory presumption that post-separation appreciation to marital property
                            was divisible; there was no dispute the dental practice prior to the date of separation was marital property. Romulus v. Romulus, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 715 S.E.2d 308 (2011).

                            Trial court properly valued the separate, marital, and divisible components of a wife's three investment accounts because the wife's testimony that the value of the accounts declined over the course of the two years prior to trial served as competent
                            evidence in support of a loss in value of the accounts, and the trial court properly characterized the loss as divisible. Watkins v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 548, 746 S.E.2d

                            Trial court properly valued a wife's 401(k) account and the divisible property associated with the account because if the trial court transposed the first two digits of the account value in arriving at its valuation, as the husband argued, any such error
                            would have increased the marital component of the account, thereby benefiting the husband, and as such, the husband could not show prejudice; the wife's testimony as to the loss associated with the account was credible. Watkins

                            Appellate court was unable to determine whether a trial court in a dissolution of marriage proceeding properly found that equal distribution was inequitable in the case because, without the benefit of proper classification, valuation, and listing of all
                            the property owned by the parties, the court could not discern whether the trial court's method of distribution was unreasonable or arbitrary; furthermore, because of the number and degree of errors the trial court committed,
                            the appellate court concluded that a new trial was required. Dalgewicz v. Dalgewicz, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 606 S.E.2d 164 (2004).

                            In finding the net value of the marital residence to be zero, the trial court erred by not only subtracting the value of the encumbrances from its fair market value, but by also deducting the expenses of sale; consideration of those expenses went beyond

                            Legal Malpractice Claim Failed as Client Did Not Value Marital Estate. - Client's legal malpractice action failed as even assuming an attorney negligently failed to advise the client or to value the client's estate properly under

                            the marital estate as of the date of separation and therefore as to the value of the client's equitable distribution claim; thus, the client failed to show that any negligence by the attorney proximately caused damage to the

                            Valuation of Partnership Interest. - When considering the value of a spouse's interest in a business partnership, the task of the appellate court on review is to determine whether the approach used by the trial court reasonably approximates the net value
                            of the partnership interest. Fox v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 404 S.E.2d 354 (1991).

                            The withdrawal formula for valuing a partnership interest is presumptively correct, though it may be attacked if not reasonably representative of the value of the defendant's interest. Fox v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite>                            13, 404 S.E.2d 354 (1991).

                            In valuing husband's interest in a business partnership, the trial court did not err by using a withdrawal formula, as opposed to a book value approach. Nor did it err by using the withdrawal formula found in the partnership agreement. Fox v. Fox,
                            <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 404 S.E.2d 354 (1991).

                            Where there was no evidence that defendant had actually withdrawn his partnership interest, or that the distribution ordered by the court would require him to do so, but the court deducted from the value of defendant's partnership interest the amount
                            of income tax defendant would have owed had he withdrawn his partnership interest, it was improper for the court to consider such hypothetical and speculative tax consequences in valuing defendant's partnership interest. Harvey

                            Downward adjustment in value of stock awarded to the spouse who had generally not managed the couple's investments to reflect loss in value between the date of separation and entry of equitable distribution was not improper where there was no showing
                            that the loss in value had anything to do with actions or failures to act on the part of the manager spouse. Allen v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 607 S.E.2d 331 (2005).

                            With respect to the increased amount paid as a result of the wife's $7,500.00 post-separation draw on the line of credit, the draw and the resulting finance charges and interest were not marital debt (or divisible property) and, therefore, the trial court
                            had no authority to distribute that debt. The trial court was directed on remand to take into account the husband's payment of finance charges incurred for the wife's separate debt. Warren v. Warren,

                            Classification of a husband's post-separation payment toward a mortgage on marital property as divisible property was proper because all post-separation payments of a marital debt were classified as divisible property pursuant to

                            Parties' pre-trial stipulations and the testimony of the parties as to the amount of the debt were sufficient to support the findings of fact, and the ex-wife could not complain of a lack of evidence on appeal when she stipulated to the debt and did not

                            because under 11 U.S.C.S.

                            Effect of Subsection (d). - By the enactment of subsection (d) of this section, the General Assembly manifested a clear intent to change the former rule which required the actual separation of the parties to a marriage in order for a property settlement
                            to be effective between spouses. Buffington v. Buffington, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 317 S.E.2d 97 (1984).

                            The public policy of the State, as expressed by subsection (d) of this section, permits spouses to execute a property settlement at any time, regardless of whether they separate immediately thereafter or not. Buffington v. Buffington,

                            Trial court did not err by allowing equitable distribution of property acquired during the parties' marriage as the parties' prenuptial agreement did not waive their claims to equitable distribution, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(d)</a></cite>;
                            based on the former husband's stated intentions regarding the creation of the agreement, his discussions with an attorney, and the actual language of the agreement, the trial court could properly find that the agreement constituted
                            a "free trader" agreement that did not waive the parties' rights to equitable distribution. McIntyre v. McIntyre, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 654 S.E.2d 798 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 503</cite>,

                            it instead mandated, among other things, that the policy favoring property settlements continue so that a prior settlement of spousal property rights would also constitute a plea in bar to the equitable distribution of "marital"

                            Interpretation of Settlement Agreement. - District court erred by interpreting a property settlement agreement via a declaratory judgment action brought by an ex-husband against his ex-wife because the proper remedy with regard to interpreting the agreement,
                            which had been incorporated into a consent judgment of divorce, was a contempt proceeding and not an independent declaratory judgment action; as a result, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the matter
                            and the order interpreting the agreement, which was in favor of the ex-husband, was vacated on appeal. Fucito v. Francis, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 622 S.E.2d 660 (2005).

                            Separation Agreement Fully Disposing of Property Rights. - If a court finds that a separation agreement fully disposes of the parties' rights arising out of the marriage, the court may not set aside the separation agreement and property settlement, absent
                            fraud or misrepresentation. A separation agreement and property settlement entered into by the parties which fully disposes of the property rights arising out of a marriage acts as a bar to equitable distribution. Rabon v.

                            Right to Cancel Separation Agreement. - In enacting subsection (d) of this section, the General Assembly did not intend that a written separation agreement, once entered into, would be forever binding or forever a bar to an equitable distribution action.
                            Rather, the parties to separation agreements must still be able to cancel their agreements, and the indicia of the intent to cancel as developed in the common law must also still be intact. Carlton v. Carlton,

                            When Separation Agreement Is Valid. - To be valid, a separation agreement must be untainted by fraud, must be in all respects fair, reasonable and just, and must have been entered into without coercion or the exercise of undue influence, and with full
                            knowledge of all the circumstances, conditions, and rights of the contracting parties. McIntosh v. McIntosh, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 328 S.E.2d 600 (1985).

                            Transactions Between Spouses Must Be Fair and Reasonable. - The relationship between a husband and a wife is the most confidential of all relationships, and transactions between them, to be valid, must be fair and reasonable. A separation agreement must
                            have been entered into without coercion. Stegall v. Stegall, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 397 S.E.2d 306 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 274</cite>, 400 S.E.2d

                            Railroad Retirement Benefits Under a Separation Agreement. - Trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of ex-wife in her suit to enforce a separation agreement, and did not err in entering an order awarding the ex-wife 29.5 percent of the
                            ex-husband's divisible railroad retirement benefits. Gilmore v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 580 S.E.2d 15 (2003).

                            Fraud Need Not Be Shown, Where Settlement Is Unfair Due to Other's Overreaching. - Courts have thrown cloak of protection about separation agreements and made it their business, when confronted, to see to it that they are arrived at fairly and equitably.
                            To warrant equity's intervention, no actual fraud need be shown, for relief will be granted if settlement is manifestly unfair to spouse because of other's overreaching. Stegall v. Stegall,

                            Existence of Confidential Relationship After One Spouse Has Left Home. - A confidential relationship, and a fiduciary duty, between husband and wife can exist even after one spouse has left the home. Where such a relationship exists, there is a duty to
                            disclose all material facts relevant to a separation agreement, and failure to do so constitutes fraud. Harroff v. Harroff, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 398 S.E.2d 340 (1990),

                            Same - After Involvement of Attorney. - The involvement of an attorney does not automatically end the confidential relationship of husband and wife. Where one spouse alleges and offers evidence that the confidential relationship still existed and that
                            the attorneys' role was merely to record the agreement the spouses negotiated, it is a question of fact as to whether the confidential relationship has been terminated. Harroff v. Harroff,

                            Otherwise, Record Must Show Understanding of and Agreement with Terms. - If oral stipulations between spouses regarding the distribution of their marital property are not reduced to writing, it must affirmatively appear in the record that the trial court
                            made contemporaneous inquiries of the parties at the time the stipulations were entered into. It should appear that the court read the terms of the stipulations to the parties, and that the parties understood the legal effects
                            of their agreement and the terms of the agreement and agreed to abide by those terms of their own free will. McIntosh v. McIntosh, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 328 S.E.2d 600 (1985).

                            Although plaintiff claimed the parties stipulated for trial that certain land would be classified as marital property, the record showed no evidence of stipulation; therefore, as the property was a gift to defendant from his mother, trial court's classification
                            of the land as marital property was error. Locklear v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 374 S.E.2d 406 (1988).

                            Where there was no evidence of a written agreement nor any affirmative assurance that the parties were in agreement concerning the division of personal property, the trial court's reliance on the parties' oral agreement or existing division of personal
                            property was error and all marital personal property should have been included in the equitable distribution. Holder v. Holder, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 578, 361 S.E.2d 891 (1987).

                            Handwritten Agreement Superseded by Later Agreement Incorporated in Judgment. - Trial court did not err in refusing to enforce a 1986 handwritten agreement between the parties which concerned the distribution of marital assets and which provided that
                            defendant would pay plaintiff $15,000 upon her remarriage or upon her sale of a specific parcel of marital property. The language in the judgment clearly indicated that property settlement agreement of 1988, which was incorporated
                            into the judgment, was a full and final settlement of the distribution of marital property which superseded any and all prior agreements between the parties. Rosania v.

                            Separation Agreement as Bar to Equitable Distribution. - A separation agreement which contained no specific references to any real property, but only to personal property, nevertheless fully disposed of the parties' property rights arising out of the
                            marriage and thus acted as a bar to equitable distribution. Hartman v. Hartman, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 452, 343 S.E.2d 11 (1986).

                            In view of separation agreement between the parties, which provided for (1) division of property, (2) effect of reconciliation on the property settlement, (3) mutual release of all personal and real property claims that the parties might have against
                            each other or might acquire under any statute of distribution, right of election or otherwise, and (4) joint custody and support of the parties' two children, and which the court found valid, the trial court erred in ordering
                            that further proceedings might be held to accomplish an equitable distribution of marital property which had allegedly not been taken account of. Rice v. Rice, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                            247, 344 S.E.2d 41, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 706</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 439 (1986).

                            Separation agreement which released each spouse from the common law rights incident to marriage (dower, curtesy, inheritance, descent, and distribution), as well as "all other rights arising out of the marital relationship in and to any and all property,"
                            fully disposed of the parties' property rights arising out of the marriage and thus acted as a bar to equitable distribution. Hagler v. Hagler, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 287</cite>, 354 S.E.2d

                            Equitable Distribution Barred Where Separation Agreement Dividing Property Has Been Executed. - If parties who had entered into a 1963 separation agreement divided and conveyed property prior to resuming their marital relationship, then the provisions
                            of the separation agreement concerning that property were "executed," and an equitable distribution suit to divide that property upon the parties' again separating in 1982 would be barred, unless the evidence showed an intent
                            to cancel those provisions of the separation agreement. Carlton v. Carlton, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 690, 329 S.E.2d 682 (1985).

                            Premarital agreements that exhibit a clear intention on the part of the parties to dispose of their property upon dissolution of their marriage through the provisions of their premarital agreement rather than through equitable distribution are expressly
                            allowed; the ability to control the disposition of property upon the dissolution of a marriage appears to be the primary purpose of most, if not all, premarital agreements. Harllee v. Harllee,

                            But Not by Executory Promises. - Wife's promise in 1963 separation agreement that she would make no future claims to husband's future property required future performance and therefore was executory, and where the parties became reconciled and lived again
                            as husband and wife between 1963 and 1982, then this promise was void as to property acquired after they resumed the marital relationship. A suit for equitable distribution of this property was therefore proper. Carlton v.

                            settlement was not met where the evidence showed that on a number of occasions during the year the parties had had sexual relations. Higgins v. Higgins, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 482</cite>,

                            Misapplication of Stipulations in Agreement. - A trial court abused its discretion in misapplying a $5000 credit, where the parties agreed (1) that certain property would be divided unequally, and (2) that the husband would receive less personal property
                            but would receive the $5000 credit. The trial court applied the credit but in effect ignored the remainder of the stipulation by including property against which the credit was to be an offset when it divided the marital estate
                            equally. Fox v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 404 S.E.2d 354 (1991).

                            Property Settlement Not Negotiated as Reciprocal Consideration. - If a property settlement is negotiated as "reciprocal consideration" for a separation agreement, the agreements are deemed integrated and the resumption of marital relations will terminate
                            the executory provisions of the property settlement agreement. If not in reciprocal consideration, the provisions of the property settlement are deemed separate and the resumption of marital relations will not affect either
                            the executed or executory provisions of the property settlement agreement. Morrison v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 402 S.E.2d 855 (1991).

                            within that time, he could purchase her equity for the same amount within 90 days after "the termination of the one-year period as is hereinabove set forth"; and that if neither bought the equity of the other, the property
                            would be listed for sale with a licensed real estate broker and upon it being sold, the net proceeds would be equally divided. Riley v. Riley, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 359 S.E.2d

                            Tenancy by Entirety Not Destroyed by Separation Agreement. - Despite contention of creditor of husband that separation agreement executed by husband and wife destroyed tenancy by the entirety and vested a property interest in husband against which creditor
                            was entitled to levy, where husband and wife were not divorced until over 8 months following the conveyance of the marital property to husband's parents, the property remained entirety property at the time of the conveyance
                            and could not be the subject of a conveyance in defraud of husband's individual creditors. The trial court erred in ordering that creditor was entitled to receive the proceeds of the sale of this property. Dealer Supply Co.

                            and are not necessarily terminated by reconciliation. Love v. Mewborn, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 339 S.E.2d 487, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347

                            Obligation to Make Money Payments Held Not Terminated on Renewal of Sexual Relations. - The trial court's finding of fact that property settlement and alimony payments were mutually dependent supported its conclusion that the husband's obligation to make
                            money payments denominated as "alimony" did not terminate upon renewal of sexual relations. Love v. Mewborn, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 339 S.E.2d 487, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>,

                            Reconciliation Provision Did Not Violate Public Policy. - Reconciliation provision of the parties' settlement agreement did not violate North Carolina's public policy as applied to the property settlement provisions of the agreement; both parties waived
                            any rights to equitable distribution in the agreement, so the trial court erred by concluding that the wife's equitable distribution claim was not affected by the agreement. Bradshaw v. Bradshaw,

                            to the Act despite the premarital agreement, where the Act did not exist at the time of the agreement's execution, and the parties could not have intended that the Act govern their property division. Howell v. Landry,

                            Attacking Consent Judgment. - A consent judgment incorporates the bargained agreement of the parties. Such a judgment can only be attacked on limited grounds. The party attacking the judgment must properly allege and prove that consent was not in fact
                            given, or that it was obtained by mutual mistake or fraud. Stevenson v. Stevenson, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 750, 398 S.E.2d 334 (1990).

                            Contract Principles Apply to Consent Judgments. - A contract may be avoided based on mutual mistake where the mistake is common to both parties and because of it each has done what neither intended. A unilateral mistake, unaccompanied by fraud, imposition,
                            or like circumstances, is not sufficient to avoid a contract. These contract principles apply to consent judgments. Stevenson v. Stevenson, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 750, 398 S.E.2d

                            Consent Order Precluded Consideration of Appreciation in Value of Property. - Trial court did not err in failing to classify, value, and distribute the increase in value of the parties' condominium in a divorce case from the date of separation to the
                            date of distribution under circumstances in which a consent order entered into by the parties stated that it was a "final" distribution and provided a value of a condominium for purposes of equitable distribution; the consent
                            order precluded further valuation and precluded any consideration of the appreciation of the condominium as divisible property. Wirth v. Wirth, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 668

                            Consent Order Precluded Distribution of Interest Earned on Proceeds of Sale of Marital Home. - Trial court properly refused to classify, value, and distribute the interest earned on the proceeds from the sale of the parties' former marital residence under
                            circumstances in which the parties' consent order provided a specific formula by which the net proceeds were to be distributed to the wife; once distributed, the property and the proceeds from its sale became wife's separate
                            property. Wirth v. Wirth, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 668 S.E.2d 603 (2008).

                            Right to Present Evidence on Issue of Separability. - On wife's motion for increase in alimony payments, where consent order entered into between husband and wife contained support provisions and property settlement provisions, an evidentiary hearing
                            was required to determine the intent of the parties regarding whether the provisions of the agreement were separable or integrated, and it was error for the trial court to refuse to allow husband to present evidence on this
                            issue. Lemons v. Lemons, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 406 S.E.2d 8 (1991), decided under law in effect in 1978 at time of consent decree.

                            Summary Judgment Held Improper. - Summary judgment was improper where there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendant disclosed all material facts pertaining to separation agreement. Harroff v. Harroff,
                            <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 398 S.E.2d 340 (1990), discretionary review denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 330</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 833 (1991).

                            Plaintiff's affidavit stated she was forced to sign separation agreement under duress and coercion, and defendant denied allegation; therefore, taking plaintiff 's affidavit as true, there was a genuine issue of material fact on question of duress and
                            coercion concerning the separation agreement, and grant of summary judgment was error. Stegall v. Stegall, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 397 S.E.2d 306 (1990), cert. denied,

                            Consent Order Was Not A Conveyance. - Dismissal of assignee's motion to subject real estate to execution sale was reversed as the assignee's judgment lien attached to a husband's undivided interest in property formerly held as a tenancy by the entirety
                            upon the date of his divorce, when the property was converted by law to a tenancy in common, and when he conveyed his interest to his former wife, she took title subject to the judgment lien; a consent order providing for a
                            future transfer of the property was not a conveyance as it provided for a future transfer of the property, did not provide a legal description or state the location of the property, and was not filed with the register of deeds.

                            Failure to Consider Property Agreement Improper. - Because a husband neither disputed a property contract nor brought any new claim of his own, it would not have been appropriate for the wife to specifically plead an affirmative defense under

                            Purpose of alimony pendente lite is to give dependent spouse immediate support and allow her to maintain her action. Giving supporting spouse credit for equitable distribution purposes for various payments made as part of alimony pendente lite would defeat
                            the purpose of alimony pendente lite by penalizing the dependent spouse in the final distribution of the marital assets. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 367 S.E.2d

                            Contingent Fee Agreement for Equitable Distribution Must Be Separate from Fee Agreement for Divorce. - If an attorney represents a client in both a divorce proceeding and an equitable distribution proceeding, and the client wishes to have a contingent
                            fee contract in the equitable distribution proceeding, the parties must execute a separate agreement to provide for a fee in the divorce action that is not contingent upon the securing of the divorce. In re Cooper,

                        <p>
                            Since the trial court heard both the alimony claim and the equitable distribution claims simultaneously, it had to determine the final equitable distribution prior to determining alimony; on remand, the trial court had to first determine the equitable
                            distribution matters prior to considering the alimony issues since the distribution could potentially change the financial circumstances of the parties including the need for or ability to pay alimony. Carpenter v. Carpenter,
                            <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 781 S.E.2d 828 (2016).

                            Where equitable distribution order took into consideration fatally defective order for temporary alimony, the court vacated the order for equitable distribution and remanded the cause to the district court. Haywood v. Haywood,

                            Modification of child support must be vacated and remanded where it is part of equitable distribution judgment and thus appears to have been decided and entered at the same time as equitable distribution, rather than after equitable distribution as required

                            Agreement Speaking to Equitable Distribution Did Not Waive Alimony Rights. - Defendant's execution of a separation agreement which stated that it was executed with "the express understanding" and "in full satisfaction of all obligations" did not constitute
                            an express waiver of her alimony rights within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.052.html#t52s52-10.1" target="_blank">G.S. 52-10.1</a></cite> or <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-16.6" target="_self">G.S. 50-16.6</a></cite>                            where the preamble to the agreement referred to this section on equitable distribution, thus excluding issues of spousal support.

                            Reconsideration of Alimony or Child Support After Equitable Distribution. - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(f)</a></cite> obviously contemplates that a child support order may precede
                            an equitable distribution order. No child support order is ever final and delaying the child support order in lengthy case until after the equitable distribution issue was decided would have prolonged an already long-pending
                            case. The trial court's decision to enter child support order prior to a determination of the equitable distribution issue was proper under the statute. Cohen v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 396 S.E.2d

                            If alimony and child support have not been previously awarded, equitable distribution must be made first; but if alimony or child support has already been awarded, the awards must be reconsidered upon request after the marital property has been equitably
                            distributed. This order of events is required, no doubt, because of the obvious relationship that exists between the property that one has and his or her need for support and the ability to furnish it. Capps v. Capps,
                            <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 318 S.E.2d 346 (1984).

                            Even assuming arguendo that the parties' settlement agreement in a divorce was an equitable distribution, a prior child support award, following an equitable distribution, need only be reconsidered upon the request of a party pursuant to

                            of any equitable distribution. Diehl v. Diehl, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 630 S.E.2d 25 (2006).

                            Equitable Distribution Judgment May Not Offset Child Support. - Defendant was not entitled to a "credit" against his future child support payments for the $12,435.50 he paid over and above his court-ordered obligation or for the $500.00 plaintiff owed
                            him as a result of an equitable distribution judgment; child support obligations may not be offset by other obligations. Brinkley v. Brinkley, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 608, 522

                            Findings of Fact Sufficient. - Trial court's findings of fact were sufficient to meet the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20" target="_self">G.S. 50-20</a></cite>; the trial court found defendant was
                            not dependent on plaintiff for maintenance nor in need of such because she had substantial unearned income in the form of life insurance proceeds, and the trial court relied on the same findings the court used to distribute
                            the parties' property as the court did to determine defendant's eligibility for alimony, as both required consideration of similar factors and were ruled upon in the same order. Crago v. Crago, - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 700

                            Authority to Order Conveyance of Title. - Courts have within their powers in equity the authority to compel one person to convey title to property to another person when justice requires it, as is best demonstrated by the courts' use of the equitable
                            remedy of constructive trust. As is indicated by subsection (g), the legislature recognized this power of the courts to order the transfer of real property under appropriate circumstances. Wade v. Wade,

                            Trial court erred as to classification of real property because there were no findings of fact, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20" target="_self">G.S. 50-20</a></cite>, necessary for the determination
                            of whether the property was marital or separate such as when it was acquired, how it was acquired, or even how it was titled; on remand, the trial court was required to make findings of fact regarding the property, including
                            whether the wife rebutted the marital gift presumption and the wife's testimony as to her donative intent was not incompetent as a matter of law. Romulus v. Romulus, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 715 S.E.2d

                            When Factors in Subsection (c) Must Be Addressed. - If evidence of one or more of the factors listed in subsection (c) is presented, the findings must reflect that the trial judge considered those factors, whether the judge ultimately orders an equal
                            or an unequal distribution. McIver v. McIver, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 116, 374 S.E.2d 144 (1988).

                            Trial court's general statement that it "considered the other statutory distributional factors" made no specific reference to the factors under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite>,
                            regarding distribution of property, making it impossible for an appellate court to determine if it found and relied on any other statutory factors, and its findings on the statutory factors it expressly considered lacked sufficient
                            detail, as the court did not value the marital debts it mentioned, nor did it find whether the husband's cars were liquid or nonliquid assets, despite the requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c9" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)(9)</a></cite>                            that the court consider the liquid or nonliquid character of all marital property and divisible property.

                            Judge Must Make Findings as to Each Statutory Factor. - When a party presents evidence which would allow the trial court to determine that an equal distribution of the marital assets would be inequitable, the trial court must then consider all of the
                            distributional factors listed in subsection (c), and must make sufficient findings as to each statutory factor on which evidence was offered; therefore, where the trial court's order explicitly stated that it considered only
                            one factor in determining how the marital assets should be divided, was error. Locklear v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 374 S.E.2d 406 (1988), cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 336</cite>,

                            Findings Must Include Ultimate Facts. - The trial court's findings were insufficient where the trial court stated that it considered all statutory factors and specifically listed some of those factors but did not include ultimate facts considered in applying
                            those factors; for example, the trial court did not make any findings regarding the actual income and liabilities of the parties, the amount of plaintiff's contribution of separate funds to the marital home, and what the tax
                            consequences to the parties would be, nor did it determine whether plaintiff's contentions that she "helped the career potential of the defendant" were accurate and, if so, the extent of plaintiff's contribution. Rosario v.

                            Specific Statement That Distribution Is Equitable Is Not Required. - Once the trial court orders a distribution, it has held sub silentio that such distribution is fair and equitable. A specific statement that the distribution ordered is equitable is
                            not required. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 770</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 829 (1985).

                            But Reasons for Unequal Division Should Be Stated in Order. - If, in a particular case, the court concludes, after its careful and clearly articulated consideration of all of the statutory factors and of any nonstatutory factor raised by the evidence
                            which is reasonably related to the rights to, interest in, and need for the marital property, that an equal division is not equitable, the trial court may properly order an unequal division, but should state in its order the

                            As Should Findings of Fact Supporting Unequal Division. - The trial court should clearly set forth in its order findings of fact based on the evidence which support its conclusion that an equal division is not equitable. Alexander v. Alexander,

                            In making its determination, the court must consider the factors listed in subsection (c) and set forth findings of fact in its judgment reflecting its consideration of the relevant factors.

                            If, in a particular case, the trial court concludes, after its consideration of all the statutory factors and any nonstatutory factors raised by the evidence which are reasonably related to the rights to, interest in, and need for the marital property,
                            that an equal division is not equitable, the court may properly order an unequal division; in this case, it should clearly set forth in its order findings of fact based on the evidence which support its conclusion that an equal
                            division is not equitable. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 322 S.E.2d 393 (1984), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 80</cite>, 331 S.E.2d 682 (1985).

                            When a party has met its burden of proof and the court has concluded that an equal distribution would not be equitable, the court must make written findings, based upon relevant statutory and nonstatutory factors, which support its conclusion that an
                            equal distribution is not equitable. Patton v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 247, 337 S.E.2d 607 (1985), rev'd in part on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 404</cite>,

                            Where the trial court made numerous findings concerning the distributional factors upon which the parties presented evidence, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's distribution of property; the trial court complied with the mandate in

                            the trial court's findings were supported by competent evidence and were sufficient to support the conclusion that an unequal distribution in the ex-husband's favor was equitable.

                            Unequal distribution of property in favor of a former wife required remand because the trial court did not make findings of fact and conclusions of law, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1j" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(j)</a></cite>                            of numerous factors under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite>, including the wife's conversion of marital assets, the non-liquidity of certain assets, the wife's contribution

                            Findings as to Increase in Value of Separate Property During Marriage. - A trial court's order which did not disclose the steps by which the trial court arrived at its conclusion that the entire increase in value of separate property was marital property,
                            left the Court of Appeals unable to determine whether the trial court correctly applied the "source of funds" theory to the facts; therefore, the order was reversed and remanded for appropriate findings of fact from the evidence
                            previously submitted. Ciobanu v. Ciobanu, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 461, 409 S.E.2d 749 (1991).

                            Findings as to Stock. - Because competent evidence was presented in equitable distribution action to support the finding that shares of stock acquired by appellee during marriage and prior to separation were a gift from his father and thus separate property,
                            the finding was not disturbed on appeal. Godley v. Godley, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 99, 429 S.E.2d 382 (1993).

                            Findings as to Evidence of Criminal Activity. - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of a former husband's criminal activity because the majority of the trial court's findings of fact concentrated on the extent and nature of
                            the damage the husband's actions inflicted on the marital home; the trial court referred to the husband's treatment of his former wife only as necessary to explain the sequence of events. Troutman v. Troutman,

                            failed to state the percentage to be distributed to each spouse upon the sale of the parties' real property, the husband failed to explain how he was prejudiced by the omission of the percentage amount because the figure could
                            be readily calculated using information contained in the findings and conclusions from the trial court's order, which provided for an equal division of the proceeds; the trial court's fair market value of the properties was

                            Impracticality of In Kind Distribution. - Adequate findings did not support a judgment equitably distributing three retirement plans, where the judgment contained no finding of fact, supported by evidence in the record, that an in kind distribution would
                            be impractical, nor did it support a finding that the parties had stipulated to distribution in the manner directed by the court. Heath v. Heath, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 509

                            Where the parties stipulated to an equal division of the marital property, which was equivalent to a stipulation that an equal division of the marital property was equitable, the trial court properly refused to make separate findings of fact regarding
                            the post-separation appreciation of the marital home, its post-separation occupancy by the plaintiff, and the tax savings allegedly realized by the plaintiff because of the post-separation occupancy of the house. Christensen

                            Trial Court Made Inadequate Findings Concerning How to Divide Marital Estate and Tax Consequences of the Division. - When a trial court found that a marital estate should be divided without a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), it inadequately
                            made no findings as to how this should be accomplished or the tax consequences to the husband if he was required to dip into his retirement, despite the requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c11" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)(11)</a></cite>                            that the tax consequences to each party be considered.

                            Liquidity or Nonliquidity of Assets Never Put In Dispute. - Former husband's claim that a trial court failed to make findings of fact pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1j" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(j)</a></cite>                            as to the liquidity of certain assets was overruled because the husband made no showing that the liquid or nonliquid nature of the assets at issue was ever brought up at trial; the husband pointed only to the wife's testimony
                            that she had made withdrawals from an IRA out of necessity, and then he made the broad statement that the nature of assets held in savings accounts, checking accounts,]and actual checks were liquid in nature. Troutman v. Troutman,

                            Failure to Enter Finding That Defendant Did Not Rebut Presumption Was Harmless Error. - Where there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that certain real property was to remain the separate property of the husband, the failure of the trial
                            court to enter a finding that defendant did not rebut the marital presumption by clear, cogent and convincing evidence was harmless. Furthermore, there was no "intention" in the deed to the parties as tenants by the entirety
                            that the property was to remain defendant's separate property. Therefore, the trial judge correctly included the property among the marital assets. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite>                            413, 374 S.E.2d 644 (1988).

                            Findings Sufficient to Support Equitable Distribution Award. - Trial court's equitable distribution award was proper under circumstances in which the trial court classified the husband's post-separation payment, from his separate funds, of a mortgage
                            on marital property as divisible property, and found that, based on the wife's unrepaid loan of $178,710 to the marital business from her separate funds, she was entitled to an award of $178,700 more than that of the husband;
                            the trial court correctly granted the husband credit for his payment by subtracting $75,644 from the marital estate and subtracting $75,644 from his award to give him sole credit for satisfying the marital debt. The trial court
                            made sufficient findings to consider the wife's loan as a distributional factor and reflecting its distribution decision. McNeely v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 705, 673 S.E.2d

                            Findings Insufficient to Support Equitable Distribution Award. - Trial court's equitable distribution order, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(a)</a></cite>, warranted reversal because
                            the court failed to make adequate findings regarding: (1) the classification, value, and distribution of the husband's 401(k) account, including the passive appreciation of that account between the date of separation and the
                            date of distribution; (2) the classification, value, and distribution of the expenditures the husband made from the funds contained in his 401(k) account, including the extent to which and purposes for which he spent the passive
                            appreciation of the 401(k) account between the date of separation and the date of distribution; (3) the classification, value, and distribution of the husband's post-separation payments on marital debt, including the extent
                            to which these payments were made with marital or separate funds; and (4) the classification, value, and distribution of specific items of debt. Bodie v. Bodie, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 727 S.E.2d 11 (2012).

                            Although a trial court made sufficient findings of fact regarding the duration of the parties' marriage, the trial court failed to make findings of fact and appropriate conclusions of law regarding the other contentions for unequal distribution raised
                            by both parties, as set forth in the pretrial order; there was nothing in the order indicating the trial court considered evidence of the parties' health and incomes. Hinkle v. Hinkle, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite>                            252, 742 S.E.2d 325 (2013).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's finding was insufficient because the court declined to make a finding as to the income, property, and liabilities of each party, finding there was no evidence to support this factor, when there was such evidence. Berens v. Berens,

                            Legislature's intent in subsection (k) was to create a right to equitable distribution of the marital property, which had not existed up to that time, and to make that right vest at the time of filing for divorce (now at the time of separation). Subsection
                            (k) did not create any vested rights in particular marital property; it created a right to the equitable distribution of that property, whatever a court should determine that property is. Wilson v. Wilson,

                            Subsection (k) did not create substantive rights in any party to particular marital property which that party argues comes within the meaning of that acquired during the course of the marriage. Wilson v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite>                            96, 325 S.E.2d 668, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 121</cite>, 332 S.E.2d 490 (1985).

                        <p>
                            The right to equitable distribution is an inchoate right exercisable only in a divorce action; thus, absent a consent judgment, the right to equitable property distribution could not be effectuated during the one-year separation period that necessarily
                            precedes a filing for absolute divorce; however, this does not mean that a claim for equitable distribution cannot be made during that period. McIver v. McIver, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite>                            116, 374 S.E.2d 144 (1988).

                            The vested right of equitable distribution does not create a property right in marital property, nor does the fact of separation create a lien on specific marital property in favor of the spouse. Rather, it only creates a right to an equitable distribution
                            of that property, whatever a court should determine that property is. Perlow v. Perlow, 128 Bankr. 412 (E.D.N.C. 1991).

                            Vesting of Award Under Subsection (k). - Superior court properly dismissed a former wife's claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, constructive fraud, and constructive trust for lack of jurisdiction because she could not recover her unpaid distributive
                            award from the proceeds of the decedent's estate inasmuch as she already owned her distributive award and had to attempt to enforce her rights through the underlying equitable distribution action in the district court, which
                            had jurisdiction. Watson v. Joyner-Watson, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 823 S.E.2d 122 (2018).

                            Subjection of Each Spouse's Interest to Claims of Creditors. - Upon divorce, each former spouse's undivided one-half interest becomes subject to the claims of his or her individual creditors. Union Grove Mill and Mfg. Co. v. Faw,
                            <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 404 S.E.2d 508 (1991).

                            Attachment of Lien Against Spouse upon Conversion to Tenancy in Common. - When property is held by married persons as tenants by the entireties, a lien of judgment effective against only one spouse does not attach to the property until the property is
                            converted into another form of estate. One such type of conversion occurs upon divorce, where property held as a tenancy by the entirety is converted into property held as a tenancy in common, and each former spouse thereafter
                            holds an undivided one-half interest in the subject property. Union Grove Mill and Mfg. Co. v. Faw, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 404 S.E.2d 508 (1991).

                            Insurance Policies. - At the time of separation there were no vested rights under insurance policy on the life of party's son. The rights only vested at his death, and until then plaintiff, as owner of the policy, could have cancelled the policy or changed
                            the beneficiary. At the time of separation, the cash value of the insurance policies was marital property, since the premiums to that point had been paid for with marital assets. The premiums after separation were paid for
                            with plaintiff's assets and therefore the proceeds from the insurance policy were separate property of plaintiff. Foster v. Foster, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 265, 368 S.E.2d 26 (1988),

                        <p>
                            Trial Court Has Broad Discretion. - The legislature clearly intended to vest trial courts with discretion in distributing marital property under this section, but guided always by the public policy expressed therein favoring an equal division. The legislative
                            intent to vest our trial courts with such broad discretion is emphasized by the inclusion of the catchall factor codified in subdivision (c)(12). White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 770</cite>,
                            324 S.E.2d 829 (1985).

                        <p>
                            The trial court has broad discretion in the division of marital property. Hartman v. Hartman, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 167, 346 S.E.2d 196 (1986), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 396</cite>, 354 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            But Court's Discretion Is Not Unlimited. - The courts do not have unlimited discretion in the division of marital property. They are limited by the presumption of equal division and by the requirement of subsection (j) of this section that they justify
                            their distribution of property with written findings of fact. Furthermore, the exercise of discretion implies conscientious judgment arrived at in accordance with established rules, and not arbitrary action. White v. White,
                            <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 308 S.E.2d 68 (1983), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 770</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 829 (1985).

                        <p>
                            The trial judge's discretion is to be upheld unless it fails to comply with the requirements of the statute. Wieneck-Adams v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 621, 410 S.E.2d 525 (1991), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 688</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Standard of Review. - Where defendant's argument on appeal was that he had brought forth enough evidence at the equitable distribution hearing to have allowed the trial judge to identify certain personal and real property as being marital property in
                            part and defendant's separate property in part, the standard of review on appeal would be limited to the question of whether any competent evidence in the record sustains the court's findings. Taylor v. Taylor,
                            <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 374 S.E.2d 644 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Trial court orders for equitable distribution are accorded substantial deference by appellate courts and appellate review is limited to a determination of whether there was a clear abuse of discretion. Hartsell v. Hartsell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 65, 657 S.E.2d 724 (2008).

                            Judgment Not Disturbed on Appeal Absent Abuse of Discretion. - The division of marital property is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its judgment should not be disturbed on review unless it is shown that the division made was
                            an abuse of discretion. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 308 S.E.2d 68 (1983), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 770</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 829 (1985);
                            Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 787, 338 S.E.2d 567 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When evidence concerning one or more of the factors in subsection (c) of this section tending to show that an equal division of the marital property would not be equitable is admitted, the court must balance that evidence with the other evidence presented,
                            keeping in mind the legislative policy strongly favoring an equal division, and must determine what constitutes an equitable division in that particular case. The balance struck by the court in weighing such evidence will not
                            be disturbed absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. Bradley v. Bradley, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 336 S.E.2d 658 (1985).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Appellate review of equitable distribution awards is limited to a determination of whether there has been a clear abuse of discretion. Patton v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 247, 337 S.E.2d 607 (1985),
                            rev'd in part on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 404</cite>, 348 S.E.2d 593 (1986).

                        <p>
                            The trial court's rulings in equitable distribution cases receive great deference and may be upset only if they are so arbitrary that they could not have been the result of a reasoned decision. Lawing v. Lawing, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                            159, 344 S.E.2d 100 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Findings of fact by the trial court are upheld on appeal as long as they are supported by competent evidence. Gum v. Gum, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 421 S.E.2d 788 (1992).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding plaintiff 50 percent of the marital portion of defendant's pension. Judkins v. Judkins, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 441 S.E.2d 139, cert. denied,
                            <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 781</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 424 (1994).

                        <p>
                            Unequal Distribution. - Although there is a presumption that an equal division of marital property is equitable, so long as the trial court considers all the distributional factors in subsection (c) and makes sufficient findings as to each statutory factor
                            on which evidence is offered, the finding of a single distributional factor by the trial court may support an unequal division. Judkins v. Judkins, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 734,
                            441 S.E.2d 139, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 781</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 424 (1994).

                        <p>
                            Or Miscarriage of Justice. - A proper order concluding that an equal division is not equitable should not be disturbed on appeal unless the appellate court, upon consideration of the cold record, can determine that the division ordered by the trial court
                            has resulted in an obvious miscarriage of justice. Alexander v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 548, 315 S.E.2d 772 (1984).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nor Will Trial Court's Findings Be Disturbed Absent Abuse. - The trial court's findings in support of an equitable but unequal division will not be disturbed on appeal unless there was a clear abuse of discretion. Weaver v. Weaver,
                            <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 324 S.E.2d 915 (1985).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the trial court made numerous findings concerning the distributional factors upon which the parties presented evidence, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's distribution of property; the trial court complied with the mandate in
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite> to consider factors and make findings in detail, and although the ex-wife presented evidence that may have permitted contrary findings,
                            the trial court's findings were supported by competent evidence and were sufficient to support the conclusion that an unequal distribution in the ex-husband's favor was equitable. Britt v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite>                            198, 606 S.E.2d 910 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Only when evidence fails to show any rational basis for the distribution ordered by the court will its determination be upset on appeal. Nix v. Nix, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 341 S.E.2d 116 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Equitable distribution order should not be disturbed unless the appellate court, upon consideration of the cold record, can determine that the division ordered has resulted in an obvious miscarriage of justice. Morris v. Morris,
                            <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 367 S.E.2d 408, overruled in part on other grounds, Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Formal errors in an equitable distribution judgment do not require reversal, particularly where the record reflects a conscientious effort by the trial judge to deal with complicated and extensive evidence. Lawing v. Lawing,
                            <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 344 S.E.2d 100 (1986).

                            and was not prejudiced by it; the wife did not request separate hearings and never objected to having both claims heard at the same time. Romulus v. Romulus, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 715 S.E.2d 308 (2011).

                            Abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court has failed to consider proper factors or has made a mistake or error with respect to the facts upon which the division was made, or when the division itself was, under the circumstances, either excessive
                            or inadequate. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 308 S.E.2d 68 (1983), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 770</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 829 (1985).

                            Awards Payable in Lump Sum or Over Time. - It is within the trial court's sound discretion to determine whether the distributive award is to be made payable as a lump sum or over a fixed period of time. Atkins v. Atkins,

                            Inadequate Findings by Trial Court Precluded Appellate Review. - Where, among other things, the classification of certain property as marital was erroneous, tainting the findings and conclusions regarding valuation and distribution, and the method of
                            valuing the marital portion of the home was inadequate to support the award to the wife, the findings and conclusions of the trial court were insufficient to allow appellate review. McIver v. McIver,

                            Trial court's conclusion that equal division of marital property would not be equitable was not supported by its findings of fact, where the court failed to make specific findings with regard to a number of factors listed under subsection (c) of this
                            section, and the case would be remanded for further proceedings. Alexander v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 548, 315 S.E.2d 772 (1984).

                            Trial court did not have authority to reaffirm divorce decree and reserve for future resolution the issue of equitable distribution; since the trial court did not set aside the divorce, but rather, attempted to nullify the consequences of defendant's
                            failure to assert her claim for equitable distribution prior to the entry of judgment of divorce, the order failed. Even if the court had effectively set aside, briefly, the divorce decree itself and then immediately reinstated
                            the divorce decree with a reservation of an equitable distribution claim, the reservation of the equitable distribution claim would have been a legal nullity because plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his equitable distribution
                            claim and defendant did not, during the time the divorce was arguably set aside, file an answer, counterclaim, or separate action requesting equitable distribution. Carter v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite>                            440, 402 S.E.2d 469 (1991).

                            Authority of Court. - Where neither party made application or stated a claim for equitable distribution prior to the judgment of absolute divorce, the trial court lacked the authority to enter such a judgment. Stirewalt v. Stirewalt,
                            <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 440 S.E.2d 854 (1994).

                            Trial court did not err in order purging defendant of contempt for failure to comply with equitable distribution judgment, by awarding the plaintiff the present value of the stock which had been assigned to her when the initial judgment had been entered.
                            It was proper for the trial court to require the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for the stock splits and the dividends which she would have received had defendant not been recalcitrant in carrying out the trial court's
                            orders. Conrad v. Conrad, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 758, 348 S.E.2d 349 (1986).

                            Court Had Jurisdiction. - Trial court was not without jurisdiction at the time it entered its subsection (i) order and it therefore had jurisdiction to award attorney's fees under that section. McKissick v. McKissick,

                            When Contingent Fee Agreement Is Enforceable. - A contingent fee arrangement covering services rendered in an equitable distribution action is fully enforceable as long as it does not provide compensation to the attorney for securing the divorce. In re
                            Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 27, 344 S.E.2d 27 (1986).

                            Contingent Fee Agreement for Equitable Distribution Must Be Separate from Fee Agreement for Divorce. - If an attorney represents a client in both a divorce proceeding and an equitable distribution proceeding, and the client wishes to have a contingent
                            fee contract in the equitable distribution proceeding, the parties must execute a separate agreement to provide for a fee in the divorce action that is not contingent upon the securing of the divorce. In re Cooper,
                            <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 27, 344 S.E.2d 27 (1986).

                            Contingent fee contract in which the fee was contingent with respect to both divorce and equitable distribution actions was void as against public policy, even though the uncontested divorce involved relatively minimal time compared with the time the
                            attorney spent on the equitable distribution claim; and the attorney could not recover either under the contract itself or in quantum meruit for services rendered pursuant to the contract. In re Cooper,

                            No Abuse of Discretion In Failing to Further Reduce Former Husband's Pension Value - Former husband failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion in not further reducing his pension value to account for contingencies of the type discussed
                            in Step five of Bishop because the husband pointed to no evidence in the record suggesting the possibility of any contingencies that could affect the value of his pension; since the husband was fully vested in his pension,
                            the possibility of termination was immaterial, and the husband made no showing or argument that a risk of insolvency existed for the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System pension plan. Cochran v. Cochran,

                        and the court divides the marital portion of the benefit equally between the participant-spouse and nonparticipant spouse, the court shall not be required to determine the total value of the marital benefits before classifying
                        and distributing the benefits. However, neither party shall be prohibited from presenting evidence of the total value of any marital benefits or of any benefits that are separate property of either spouse. When a pension, retirement,
                        or deferred compensation plan, program, system, or fund, or an applicable statute limits or restricts the amount of the benefit subject to equitable distribution by a State court, the award shall be determined using the proportion
                        of time the marriage existed (up to the date of separation of the parties) simultaneously with the total time of the employment which earned the benefit subject to equitable distribution to the total time of employment, as limited
                        or restricted by the plan, program, system, fund, or statute that earned the benefit subject to equitable distribution.

                        determinable balances, including, but not limited to, individual retirement accounts and defined contribution plans, such as those within the definitions of Internal Revenue Code section 401(k), 403(b), 408, 408A, or 457, the court
                        shall not determine the award using the fraction described in subsection (d) of this section. The court instead shall determine the marital portion of the benefit by determining the amount of the account balance that is due to
                        contributions made or earned during the marriage and before separation, together with the income, gains, losses, appreciation, and depreciation accrued on those contributions. If sufficient evidence is not presented to the court

                        the award shall not include contributions that may accrue or be made after the date of separation, or any income, gains, losses, appreciation, and depreciation accrued on those contributions.

                        Railroad Retirement Benefits Under a Separation Agreement. - Trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of ex-wife in her suit to enforce a separation agreement, and did not err in entering an order awarding the ex-wife 29.5 percent of the
                        ex-husband's divisible railroad retirement benefits. Gilmore v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 580 S.E.2d 15 (2003).

                        Entitlement to Unvested Stock at the Time of Separation. - Where the wife, pursuant to entering an employment agreement prior to the parties' separation, received 10,000 shares of the employer's stock after the parties' separation, which were later exchanged
                        with the stock of the corporation that purchased the employer and was sold for net proceeds of $82,637, the trial court did not err in valuing the property pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-21ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-21(b)</a></cite>,
                        which occurred after 20 years of marriage; it was reasonable for the trial court to infer that the wife's employment with the employer resulted from experience that the wife gained while working, for 20 years, for the company from
                        which the employer spun off and that, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20.1ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20.1(d)</a></cite>, all of the shares were subject to distribution in the divorce. Ubertaccio v. Ubertaccio,

                        Defined Contribution Pension Plans. - Trial court properly applied a coverture fraction to the husband's defined contribution pension plan as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20.1" target="_self">G.S. 50-20.1</a></cite>;

                        pension, one-half of the marital portion of each of defendant's pension payments, to be paid by defendant at the time he began receiving benefits; however, the trial court failed to determine that defendant's military pension was
                        a defined benefit retirement plan and failed to value it. Cunningham v. Cunningham, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 615 S.E.2d 675 (2005).

                        Military Retirement Benefits Under Separation Agreement. - Because the parties' separation agreement offered no specific language referring to an alternate means of distribution of the ex-husband's military retirement pay, the trial court correctly applied
                        the provisions related to distribution of retirement benefits found in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20.1ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20.1(d)</a></cite>.

                        Immediate Distribution Proper. - Trial court did not err in making an immediate distribution of a former husband's pension benefits because the husband was fully vested and eligible for early retirement; the trial court awarded the husband all of his
                        pension benefits and then awarded the former wife a larger portion of the remaining assets, precisely as permitted by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-20.1(a)</a></cite>.

                        Valuation of Defined Benefit Plan - Trial court did not clearly comply with the third and fourth steps of Bishop in reducing a former husband's pension benefits to present value because its finding of fact as to the actuarial present value of the defined
                        benefit plan did not specifically state whether the present value was being determined as of the earliest retirement date or date of separation; because the cost of living adjustment was not a contribution to the plan or compensation
                        being paid after the date of separation but was instead a gain on the benefit vested at the time of separation, the trial court was required to take it into account under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20.1ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20.1(d)</a></cite>.

                        Award Calculation. - Although a husband argued the fraction an arbitrator used to determine the marital portion of the husband's retirement plan account was not in accordance with the directive of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20.1ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20.1(d)</a></cite>,
                        the arbitrator's determination was not an evident mistake under the Family Law Arbitration Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a03s50-55ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 50-55(a)(1)</a></cite>, because even though the husband worked
                        for the employer from 1977 through 2000, the husband only participated in the plan from 1989 through 2000; the husband determined the award was to be premised upon the time the marriage existed, simultaneous with the employment
                        that earned the benefit, for a total of 34 months, as compared to the time the husband participated in the retirement plan, 123 months. Barton v. Barton, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 235, 715 S.E.2d 529 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in classifying and valuing a husband's IRA because the husband's pension rollover IRA was funded entirely from the husband's defined pension, requiring application of the coverture fraction to derive the marital and separate components
                        of the account, rather than the methodology presented by the wife's expert upon which the trial court relied. Watkins v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 548, 746 S.E.2d 394 (2013), review
                        denied <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 290</cite>, 753 S.E.2d 670, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 68 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly distributed a wife's state pension where it employed the coverture fraction mandated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20.1ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20.1(d)</a></cite> and awarded the husband a larger
                        share of other marital assets to achieve equity. Lund v. Lund, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 779 S.E.2d 175 (2015).

                    <p>
                        In a divorce case, the formula used by a trial court to calculate the fixed percentage of the husband's military retirement benefits to be awarded to the wife was exactly the formula set forth in Seifert v. Seifert, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 367</cite>,
                        354 S.E.2d 506 (1987), and this statute, and the appellate court declined a request to consider a new formula. Gurganus v. Gurganus, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 796 S.E.2d 811 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Husband's income as an attorney from a contingent fee case was wrongly classified because (1) the income was classified as both deferred compensation and divisible income, (2) the income was not deferred compensation, as, at separation, the husband and
                        the husband's law firm were not certain to receive anything from the case, and (3) the income was not divisible property, as the husband had no pre-separation right to income, and the husband was not a party to the contingent fee

                        At any time after a husband and wife begin to live separate and apart from each other, a claim for equitable distribution may be filed and adjudicated, either as a separate civil action, or together with any other action brought pursuant to Chapter 50
                        of the General Statutes, or as a motion in the cause as provided by G.S. 50-11(e) or (f). Within 90 days after service of a claim for equitable distribution, the party who first asserts the claim shall prepare and serve upon the
                        opposing party an equitable distribution inventory affidavit listing all property claimed by the party to be marital property and all property claimed by the party to be separate property, and the estimated date-of-separation fair
                        market value of each item of marital and separate property. Within 30 days after service of the inventory affidavit, the party upon whom service is made shall prepare and serve an inventory affidavit upon the other party. The inventory
                        affidavits prepared and served pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to amendment and shall not be binding at trial as to completeness or value. The court may extend the time limits in this subsection for good cause shown.
                        The affidavits are subject to the requirements of G.S. 1A-1, Rule 11, and are deemed to be in the nature of answers to interrogatories propounded to the parties. Any party failing to supply the information required by this subsection
                        in the affidavit is subject to G.S. 1A-1, Rules 26, 33, and 37. During the pendency of the action for equitable distribution, discovery may proceed, and the court shall enter temporary orders as appropriate and necessary for the
                        purpose of preventing the disappearance, waste, or destruction of marital or separate property or to secure the possession thereof.

                        For purposes of equitable distribution, marital property shall be valued as of the date of the separation of the parties, and evidence of preseparation and postseparation occurrences or values is competent as corroborative evidence of the value of marital
                        property as of the date of the separation of the parties. Divisible property and divisible debt shall be valued as of the date of distribution.

                        to make application, then the other party may do so. At the conference the court shall determine a schedule of discovery as well as consider and rule upon any motions for appointment of expert witnesses, or other applications,

         Some of the cases below were decided prior to the rewriting of this section by Session Laws 1987, c. 844, which provides for entry of a consent judgment of equitable distribution prior or subsequent to entry of a divorce judgment, and for institution of an action of equitable distribution prior to entry of a divorce judgment.

                        Public policy of this State is that equitable distribution of property shall follow decree of absolute divorce. Hendrix v. Hendrix, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 313 S.E.2d 25 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Equitable distribution, when properly demanded, must be granted upon the divorce decree being entered; and if alimony and child support has not been previously awarded, equitable distribution must be made first; but if alimony or child support has already
                        been awarded, the awards must be reconsidered upon request after the marital property has been equitably distributed. This order of events is required, no doubt, because of the obvious relationship that exists between the property
                        that one has and his or her need for support and the ability to furnish it. Capps v. Capps, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 318 S.E.2d 346 (1984). But see now subsection (a) of this section.

                    <p>
                        It is North Carolina's public policy that an equitable distribution of property shall follow a decree of absolute divorce. However, a resort to the equitable distribution law is not the only recognized way for married people to dispose of their marital
                        property. An alternative is in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(d)</a></cite>. Case v. Case, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 325 S.E.2d 661, cert. denied,

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The plain language of subsection (a) of this section clearly provides that the equitable distribution of marital property must follow a decree of absolute divorce; however, the distribution proceedings may be instituted as a cross action or in a suit
                        altogether separate from the divorce action. This section does not require that the distribution hearing must be held immediately following entry of the absolute divorce. Sharp v. Sharp, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite>                        128, 351 S.E.2d 799 (1987). And see now subsection (a) of this section.

                    <p>
                        No Right to Jury Trial in Equitable Distribution Action. - No right to bring an action for equitable distribution of marital property existed prior to the adoption of the equitable distribution statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20" target="_self">G.S. 50-20</a></cite>                        and this section, and the language of the statutes themselves create no new right to trial by jury; therefore, there is no right to trial by jury for such an action under the Constitution of North Carolina. Kiser v. Kiser,
                        <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 502</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 487 (1989).

                    <p>
                        Discretion of Trial Court. - The trial court retains the discretion to choose the appropriate method of compensating the spouse for his post-separation payment of marital debt. Loving v. Loving, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite>                        501, 455 S.E.2d 885 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Judgment effectuating a property distribution pursuant to an agreement that was not signed by both spouses was a court-ordered equitable distribution granted before absolute divorce, and as such was expressly prohibited by subsection (a) of this section.
                        Collar v. Collar, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 105, 356 S.E.2d 407 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Subject Matter Jurisdiction. - In a case arising from a divorce action, an argument that a trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter an equitable distribution on April 5, 2002, was rejected because the prayers for relief put the parties on notice that
                        they both sought equitable distribution. Moreover, regardless of whether the parties were separated at the time the complaint was filed, the record was clear that the parties were separated by the time the claim for equitable distribution
                        was asserted. Gurganus v. Gurganus, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 796 S.E.2d 811 (2017).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While both parties raised a claim for equitable distribution, both raised it prior to the date of separation. Because no claim for equitable distribution was filed after the parties' date of separation, the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction
                        to enter the equitable distribution order. Standridge v. Standridge, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 834, 817 S.E.2d 463 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction over Out-of-State Property. - Subsection (a) of this section simply authorizes jurisdiction over the property of the defendant located outside North Carolina once due process concerns are satisfied. Carroll v. Carroll,
                        <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 363 S.E.2d 872 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Alternative Procedures for Making Application for Distribution. - Although subsection (a) of this section sets out the procedure for making application for the distribution of property, it is not the only recognized way for married people to dispose of
                        their marital property. An alternative is found in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(d)</a></cite>. Hendrix v. Hendrix, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 354,

                    <p>

                        Pleadings. - A plaintiff in a divorce action may admit to a claim for equitable distribution in a reply, and join in the claims for an equitable distribution of the marital property through a reply pleading. The defendant is precluded, by principles of
                        equitable estoppel, from defeating plaintiff's right to equitable distribution by submitting to a voluntary dismissal of his counterclaim. Hunt v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 280, 450

                        Wife sufficiently preserved her claim to an equitable distribution of marital property under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 50-11(e)</a></cite> when her answer to her husband's complaint for
                        divorce requested and reserved a right to equitable distribution, because the remedy of equitable distribution in a divorce case only applied to marital assets, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-21ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-21(a)</a></cite>                        gave a party asserting a claim for such redress 90 days to provide specific information about the property claimed to be subject to equitable distribution; so, to constitute a valid equitable distribution claim, the wife's counterclaim
                        for equitable distribution did not have to state that it applied to the parties' marital assets or property, and the husband was put on notice that the wife asked the court to equitably distribute the parties' marital and divisible
                        property. Coleman v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 641 S.E.2d 332 (2007).

                        In divorce proceedings, a former wife was not entitled to compel an equitable distribution affidavit from the former husband because the wife failed to properly file her equitable distribution claim pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-21ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-21(a)</a></cite>                        as a separate action, cross-action, or motion in the cause within six months after the husband dismissed his own equitable distribution claim as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-11ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 50-11(e)</a></cite>                        and (f); an oral motion by the wife for such a claim did not constitute the required motion.

                        Bankruptcy. - Following the parties' separation, a spouse's right to equitable distribution does not create any vested rights in particular marital property, but rather creates in each spouse an unliquidated, unsecured, contingent claim as defined by
                        federal law which may be discharged in bankruptcy. Justice v. Justice, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 475 S.E.2d 225 (1996), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 176</cite>, 484 S.E.2d

                        Equitable distribution reflects the idea that marriage is a partnership enterprise to which both spouses make vital contributions and which entitles the homemaker spouse to a share of the property acquired during the relationship. White v. White,
                        <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 770</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 829 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Equitable distribution is not automatic. A party seeking equitable distribution must specifically apply for it, either by way of cross-action in an action brought for absolute divorce or as a separate action. Hagler v. Hagler,
                        <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 287</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 228 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Where death ends all chance for divorce, any equitable distribution action then pending must abate; the 1995 amendment to this section did not change the relationship between equitable distribution and divorce. Instead, the amendment continued the legislative
                        trend for equitable distribution to occur at any time prior to or after an absolute divorce. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 220</cite>, 539 S.E.2d 621 (2000).

                        Trial Court Must Make Written Findings. - When determining equitable distribution, the trial court must make written findings characterizing postseparation appreciation of marital assets as either passive or active. Smith v. Smith,

                        The trial court's error in failing to make specific findings of fact as to each factor under this section did not prejudice the wife, where she asked for and received an equal distribution of marital assets. Crutchfield v. Crutchfield,

                        Formerly No Authority to Enter Order of Equitable Distribution Preceding Divorce. - Prior to the 1987 amendment to this section, although the trial court had jurisdiction over the parties and their property, it was without authority to enter an order
                        of equitable distribution of the marital property preceding an absolute divorce, notwithstanding the parties' consent. McKenzie v. McKenzie, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 188, 330 S.E.2d 270

                        Setting Aside Pre-trial Order. - Trial court erred in setting aside a pre-trial order, upon its own motion, prior to entry of an equitable distribution judgment because the order was entered in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-21ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-21(d)</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C.

                        the order containing the parties' binding stipulations, and the court failed to give either party notice of its intent to set aside the order. Plomaritis v. Plomaritis, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 730 S.E.2d

                        Separate Trials for Divorce and Distribution. - The trial court's order granting the plaintiff's motion for separate trials of his claim for absolute divorce and the defendant's claim for equitable distribution of the marital property did not constitute
                        an abuse of discretion, nor did it prejudice the defendant's substantial rights. Sharp v. Sharp, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 351 S.E.2d 799 (1987).

                        When Equitable Distribution Becomes Operative. - By the terms of subsection (a), equitable distribution becomes operative only after a husband and wife have separated and a claim for equitable distribution has been filed. Armstrong v. Armstrong,

                        Husband's argument that one must be a party to an existing divorce action before an equitable distribution claim may be asserted had no merit under subsection (a) of this section as it existed in 1981, and would have been summarily dismissed under the
                        1987 amended version. McIver v. McIver, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 116, 374 S.E.2d 144 (1988).

                        The classification, valuation, and distribution of the marital debt is required without regard to whether the debt may be liquidated after the date of separation and before the trial; just as with assets, the question is whether the debt was acquired
                        during the marriage and before the date of separation and in existence on the date of separation. Loving v. Loving, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 455 S.E.2d 885 (1995).

                        Inventory Affidavit. - Where the husband was given a copy of expert opinion of business valuation before trial, the wife was not limited to her inventory affidavit relating to the value of the business and was free to present the expert's testimony. Franks

                        Marital Property Is Valued as of the Date of the Parties' Separation. - This valuation date is used to determine the equitable distributive share of each party. However, where there is evidence of active or passive appreciation of the marital assets after
                        that date, the court must consider such appreciation as a factor under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 50-20(c)</a></cite>(11a) or (12), respectively. Mishler v. Mishler,

                        corporation that purchased the employer and was sold for net proceeds of $82,637, the trial court did not err in valuing the property pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-21ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 50-21(b)</a></cite>,
                        which occurred after 20 years of marriage; it was reasonable for the trial court to infer that the wife's employment with the employer resulted from experience that the wife gained while working, for 20 years, for the company from
                        which the employer spun off and that, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20.1ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20.1(d)</a></cite>, all of the shares were subject to distribution in the divorce. Ubertaccio v. Ubertaccio,

                        Effect of Obligation to Build Road on Fair Market Value. - In making a determination as to the fair market value of property the trial court must ascertain the price a willing buyer would pay to purchase the land on the open market from a willing seller
                        as of the date of the parties' separation. Thus, the value, if any, of the obligation to build an access road on the property is intrinsic to the fair market price and should have been included in the trial court's fair market

                        Value of property at the time of separation is especially important when an appreciation or diminution in the value of the property has taken place since separation, such as the incurring or removing of encumbrances by one spouse. Swindell v. Lewis,

                        Even if property division was made on the basis of 1983 values, rather than values in 1972, when the parties separated, that division would merely reflect the 50% of the marital property that plaintiff wife was entitled to at separation plus 50% of any
                        appreciation after separation, which would be her separate property, where defendant administrator did not show that the property's appreciation was due to deceased husband's contributions, monetary or otherwise. The plaintiff
                        thus would receive the same amount of property regardless of whether the marital property was considered at its 1972 value or its 1983 value. Swindell v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite>                        423, 346 S.E.2d 237 (1986).

                        Trial court is required to consider only evidence of the value of the marital property as of the date of separation, thus rendering evidence of post-separation occurrences incompetent for the purpose of valuing marital property. Consequently, a trial
                        court is under a duty to exclude such incompetent evidence from its consideration, and its failure to do so is reviewable by the appellate court even in the absence of an objection to the evidence at trial. Christensen v. Christensen,

                        of necessity intervened between absolute divorce and an award of title pursuant to equitable distribution when property was held by the entireties, whether or not the divorce and the equitable distribution occurred in a single

                        Deed of Trust Executed Without Wife's Consent Attached to Husband's Interest. - When defendants were divorced the tenancy by the entirety in which their marital home was held became a tenancy in common, and the lien of deed of trust executed by husband
                        without wife's consent attached to defendant husband's one-half undivided interest in the property.

                        failed to state the percentage to be distributed to each spouse upon the sale of the parties' real property, the husband failed to explain how he was prejudiced by the omission of the percentage amount because the figure could
                        be readily calculated using information contained in the findings and conclusions from the trial court's order, which provided for an equal division of the proceeds; the trial court's fair market value of the properties was negative

                        interests until the plaintiff's claim for equitable distribution was filed on May 14, 1984, well after both the act and the amendment became effective. This was not a retroactive application of the act or of the amendment. Armstrong

                        Trial court did not err in awarding attorney's fees to a wife in a dissolution proceeding because the trial court's findings of fact were supported by competent evidence detailing the wife's efforts to seek attachment of the husband's wages and the husband's

                        the husband did not make a written request for sanctions and the language cited by the husband as allegedly giving the wife notice appeared in the equitable distribution order a distributional factor, and not as grounds for sanctions.

                        It was error to impose sanctions on a wife for allegedly failing to timely file an equitable distribution affidavit because, inter alia, the husband did not comply with the statutory requirements for a scheduling and discovery conference, possible mediation,
                        or a final pretrial conference. Green v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 763 S.E.2d 540 (2014).

       § 50-37. Enforcement authority of child support hearing officer; contempt.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    When a child support case is before a child support hearing officer for enforcement of a child support order, the hearing officer has the same authority that a district court judge would have, except in cases of contempt. Orders that commit a party to
                    jail for civil or criminal contempt for the nonpayment of child support, or for otherwise failing to comply with a child support order, may be entered only by a district court judge. When it appears to a hearing officer that there
                    is probable cause for finding such contempt in a case before the child support hearing officer and that no other enforcement remedy would be effective or sufficient, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding probable cause and
                    referring the case for hearing before a district court judge. The order may indicate the amount of payment the responsible parent may make, or other action he may take, or both, to comply with the child support order. If proof of compliance
                    is made to the hearing officer within a time specified in the order, the hearing officer may cancel the referral of the contempt case to district court. Except as specifically limited by this section, a clerk or magistrate acting as
                    a child support hearing officer retains all of the contempt powers he or she otherwise has by virtue of being a clerk or magistrate.

                        It is the policy of this State to allow, by agreement of all parties, the arbitration of all issues arising from a marital separation or divorce, except for the divorce itself, while preserving a right of modification based on substantial change of circumstances
                        related to alimony, child custody, and child support. Pursuant to this policy, the purpose of this Article is to provide for arbitration as an efficient and speedy means of resolving these disputes, consistent with Chapters 50,
                        50A, 50B, 51, 52, 52B, and 52C of the General Statutes and similar legislation, to provide default rules for the conduct of arbitration proceedings, and to assure access to the courts of this State for proceedings ancillary to

                        No Evident Miscalculation or Mistake. - Although a husband argued the fraction an arbitrator used to determine the marital portion of the husband's retirement plan account was not in accordance with the directive of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a01s50-20.1ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 50-20.1(d)</a></cite>,

                        for the employer from 1977 through 2000, the husband only participated in the plan from 1989 through 2000; the husband determined the award was to be premised upon the time the marriage existed, simultaneous with the employment
                        that earned the benefit, for a total of 34 months, as compared to the time the husband participated in the retirement plan, 123 months. Barton v. Barton, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 235, 715 S.E.2d 529 (2011).

                        Interlocutory Order. - Court of appeals did not review a father's appeal from an order denying his motions seeking post-award discovery because the interlocutory order was not a judgment under the Family Law Arbitration Act, and the father did not demonstrate
                        that the interlocutory order deprived him of a substantial right. Stokes v. Crumpton, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 757, 784 S.E.2d 537 (2016).

                        Judgment. - Language, "a judgment entered pursuant to provisions of this Article," suggests the courts construe "judgment" in pari materia and identify other uses of the term in the Family Law Arbitration Act; in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50a03s50-57ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 50-57(a)</a></cite>                        and 50-59(a), "judgment" refers to a court's final ruling after confirmation, modification, or correction of the arbitration award and, thus, a "judgment entered pursuant to provisions of this Article," is a final judgment, similar
                        to the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act. Stokes v. Crumpton, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 757, 784 S.E.2d 537 (2016).
