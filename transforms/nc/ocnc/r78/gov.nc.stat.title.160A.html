                        Housing authority provided a governmental function and was entitled to rely on doctrine of governmental immunity as it related to a personal injury suit brought against it; G.S. 160A-485(a) did not control whether or not the housing authority had legal
                        capacity to waive its immunity by buying insurance, but authority could have accepted liability to the extent of insurance purchased, and the case was therefore remanded since the appellate court was unable to discern whether the

                        Legislative Mandate. - The North Carolina Supreme Court treats the language in this section as a legislative mandate to construe in a broad fashion the provisions and grants of power contained in this Chapter. Homebuilders Ass'n v. City of Charlotte,

                        Mandate of G.S. 160A-4 Has Replaced "Dillon's Rule." - Narrow rule of statutory construction entitled "Dillon's Rule," used when interpreting municipal powers, has been replaced by the mandate of G.S. 160A-4; and the language of

                            reasonably necessitate additional and supplementary powers to carry them into execution and effect. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v. City of Laurinburg, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 75, 606 S.E.2d 721, cert. denied,

                        Construction with G.S. 160A-301. - Zoning amendment, which addressed the number of vehicles that could be parked on a private lot, did not address the same subject as G.S. 160A-301, which governed ordinary parking on public vehicular areas; therefore,
                        G.S. 160A-301 is not a more "specific" statute that renders the provisions of G.S. 160A-4 inapplicable because it simply addresses a different subject. Patmore v.

                        A municipality may not exercise any power not granted to it, and possesses no inherent authority to exercise powers either expressly or impliedly prohibited by statute. Porsh Bldrs., Inc. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 550</cite>,
                        276 S.E.2d 443 (1981).

                        Municipal Powers Must Be Expressly Granted or Implied from Express Grants. - A municipal corporation is a political subdivision of the State and can exercise only such powers as are granted in express words, or those necessary or fairly implied or incident
                        to the powers expressly conferred, or those essential to the accomplishment of the declared objects and purposes of the corporation. Stephenson v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 42</cite>,
                        59 S.E.2d 195 (1950).

                    <p>
                        A municipal corporation has only such powers as are granted to it by the General Assembly in its specific charter or by the general laws of the State applicable to all municipal corporations, and the powers granted in its charter will be construed together
                        with those given under the General Statutes. Laughinghouse v. City of New Bern, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 596</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 802 (1950); Starbuck v. Town of Havelock, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 176</cite>,

                        A municipal corporation is a creature of the General Assembly and has no inherent power, but can exercise such powers as are expressly conferred by the General Assembly or such as are necessarily implied by those expressly given. State v. McGraw,

                        A municipal corporation has only such powers as are granted to it by the General Assembly in its specific charter or by the general laws of the State applicable to all municipal corporations, or such powers as are necessarily implied by those given. State

                    <p>
                        An incorporated city or town is an agency created by the State. It has no governmental power or authority except such as has been granted to it by the legislature, expressly or by necessary implication from the powers expressly conferred. State v. Furio,
                        <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 353</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 275 (1966).

                        Municipal corporations are created by legislative enactment and possess only those powers conferred in the express language of a statute and those necessarily implied by law therefrom. Porsh Bldrs., Inc. v. City of Winston-Salem,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">302 N.C. 550</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 443 (1981).

                    <p>
                        What Municipal Powers Are Implied. - The implied powers of a municipality are those which are necessarily or fairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted or essential to the accomplishment of the purposes of the corporation. Green v.
                        Kitchin, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 450</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 545 (1948), commented on in 27 N.C.L. Rev. 500 (1949).

                    <p>
                        A municipal corporation is authorized by implication to do an act if the doing of such act is necessarily or fairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted, or is essential to the accomplishment of the declared objects and purposes of the
                        corporation. Harrelson v. City of Fayetteville, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 87</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 749 (1967).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Municipal corporations have no inherent police powers and can exercise only those conferred, which powers are subject to strict construction. Kass v. Hedgepeth, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 405</cite>, 38 S.E.2d 164 (1946).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An incorporated city or town has no inherent police powers. State v. Furio, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 353</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 275 (1966).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A city or town in this State has no inherent police power. It may exercise only such powers as are expressly conferred upon it by the General Assembly or as are necessarily implied from those expressly so conferred. Town of Conover v. Jolly,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">277 N.C. 439</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 879 (1970).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Town had no Authority to Impose Impact Fees. - Water and sewer "impact fee" ordinances were invalid because the Public Enterprise Statutes failed to empower the town to impose impact fees for future services; the enabling statutes clearly and unambiguously
                        empowered the town to charge for the contemporaneous use of water and sewer services, not to collect fees for future discretionary spending, and because the legislature alone controlled the extension of municipal authority, the
                        ordinances exceeded the powers delegated to the town. Quality Built Homes, Inc. v. Town of Carthage, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 15</cite>, 789 S.E.2d 454 (2016).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        No Power to Spend Tax Revenues Absent Authorization. - A municipality is a creature of the State, with the powers prescribed by the statute and those necessarily implied by law, and no other; therefore a city or town cannot make a rightful outlay of its
                        tax revenues unless the outlay is explicitly or implicitly authorized by a statute conforming to the Constitution. Horner v. Chamber of Commerce, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 440</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 789
                        (1950), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 77</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 660 (1952); Wilson v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 14</cite>, 76 S.E.2d 546 (1953).

                    <p>
                        A municipal corporation has no authority to waive its immunity from tort liability in performance of its governmental functions. Stephenson v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 42</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 195 (1950).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Municipal Authority to Charge User Fees. - Applying the broad rule of construction of this section, city possessed the authority to charge regulatory user fees as an additional and supplementary power that was reasonably necessary or expedient to carry
                        a regulatory program into execution and effect. Homebuilders Ass'n v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 37</cite>, 442 S.E.2d 45 (1994).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Absent Statutory Authority. - In the absence of statutory authority, a municipality has no authority to contract away or waive its governmental immunity in respect to torts committed in the exercise of its governmental function. Valevais v. City of New
                        Bern, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 178 S.E.2d 109 (1970).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ordinances Having Effect Outside Territorial Limits of Corporation. - While the legislature may confer upon a municipal corporation the power to enact ordinances having effect in territory contiguous to the corporation, in the absence of the grant of
                        such power a city or town may not, by its ordinance, prohibit acts outside its territorial limits or impose criminal liability therefor. State v. Furio, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 353</cite>, 148 S.E.2d
                        275 (1966).

                    <p>
                        Statutory delegations of power to municipalities should be strictly construed, resolving any ambiguity against the corporation's authority to exercise the power. Porsh Bldrs., Inc. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 550</cite>,
                        276 S.E.2d 443 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Any Doubts Must Be Resolved Against Municipality. - A municipality has no inherent police powers, but can exercise only those conferred by the State, and any reasonable doubt concerning such powers is resolved against it. State v. Dannenberg,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">150 N.C. 799</cite>, 63 S.E. 946 (1909).

                    <p>
                        Discretion as to Accomplishment of Municipal Purposes. - A municipal corporation has only those powers expressly granted in its charter and by the general law, construing the acts together, and those powers reasonably implied in or incident to the granted
                        powers which are necessary to effect the fair intent and purpose of its creation; however, it may exercise a sound discretion as to the means by which the purposes of its creation may be accomplished. Riddle v. Ledbetter,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">216 N.C. 491</cite>, 5 S.E.2d 542 (1939).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A municipal corporation may exercise all the powers within the fair intent and purpose of its creation which are reasonably necessary to give effect to the powers expressly granted, and in doing this it may exercise discretion as to the means to the end.
                        Keeter v. Town of Lake Lure, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 252</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 634 (1965).

                    <p>
                        Although the power to impose a privilege license tax must be construed broadly to include incidental powers, a privilege license tax, standing alone, is only a tax and does not carry with it any powers wholly unrelated to its imposition or administration.
                        Fantasy World, Inc. v. Greensboro Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 603, 592 S.E.2d 205, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 543</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 43 (2004).

                    <p>
                        The courts will not inquire into the motives which prompt a municipality's legislative body to enact an ordinance which is valid on its face. Clark's Greenville, Inc. v. West, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 527</cite>, 151 S.E.2d
                        5 (1966).

                    <p>
                        Contracts with Firefighters Not Ultra Vires. - As the legislature expressly authorized municipal corporations to fix salaries or other compensation or to approve and adopt pay plans to compensate city employees, and thus, the city could legally form contracts
                        for the services of firefighters and offer a plan for accumulated vacation leave as a benefit under the contracts, even though they may have been executed improperly, any contracts entered into by the city through its agents to
                        compensate firefighters with accumulated vacation leave were not ultra vires the city. Pritchard v. Elizabeth City, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 344 S.E.2d 821, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 417</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Contract with Town Manager Not Ultra Vires. - The execution of an employment contract providing severance pay to an at-will town manager was not ultra vires. Myers v. Town of Plymouth, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite>                        707, 522 S.E.2d 122 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Eminent Domain Power of a City. - City lawfully exercised its eminent domain power because, consistent with the mandates of G.S. 160A-4 and G.S. 160A-312, the city could acquire property by condemnation to establish a gas transmission and distribution
                        system, even in the absence of a concrete, immediate plan to furnish gas services to its citizens as the acquisition was for a public use by the city in compliance with G.S. 160A-240.1 and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.040A.html#t40Aa01s40A-3ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 40A-3(b)</a></cite>.

        Authority to Impose Water And Sewer Fees.
       </b> - City was entitled to partial summary judgment as a matter of law because an act transferred the authority of the Board of Light and Water to collect water and sewer fees for services "to be furnished" to the city,
                        and thus, there was no genuine issue as to any material fact with respect to the city's legislative authority to charge those fees to developers for their developments; the General Assembly was not required to use the word "transfer"

                        Control of Municipal Territory and Affairs. - When a municipal corporation is established it takes control of the territory and affairs over which it is given authority to the exclusion of other governmental agencies. Gunter v. Sanford,

                    <p>
                        Exclusive Control of Municipal Streets. - The object of incorporating a town or city is to invest the inhabitants of the municipality with the government of all matters that are of special municipal concern, and certainly the streets are as much of a
                        special and local concern as anything connected with a town or city can be. It ought, therefore, to be presumed that they pass under the exclusive control of the municipality as soon as it comes into existence under the law. Gunter

                    <p>
                        Power to Levy Fees. - Trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of a city because 1985 N.C. Sess. Laws. 861 did not give the city the power to levy prospective water and sewer fees; the General Assembly provided the city with the fee-levying
                        powers granted to all municipalities under the General Enterprise Statutes and eliminated the Board of Light and Water Commissioners of the City consistent with the plenary powers found in the constitution consistent with the plenary

                        Power to Purchase Land at Tax Sale. - The title of the purchaser at a tax foreclosure sale may not be challenged by the listed owner upon the purchaser's motion for a writ of assistance; such purchaser may be a municipality where it does not appear of
                        record that the purchase of the land was ultra vires, a municipality having the power to purchase land for certain purposes. Wake County v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 478</cite>, 174 S.E. 303

                        Ownership and Operation of Private For-Profit Corporation. - The authority of a city to hold property granted by this section should not be interpreted to authorize a city to act as a shareholder of a private for-profit corporation organized under the
                        provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>, and to appoint city officials and employees as corporate directors or officers. See opinion of

                        While there may be authority for a city to purchase all of the stock of a corporation which owns and operates a water and sewer system, there is no authority to operate and continue the existence of a private for-profit corporation which is outside of
                        the traditional functions of a municipality and for which there is no judicial or legislative approval. See opinion of the Attorney General to H. Michael Boyd, Deputy City Attorney, City of Charlotte, 60 N.C.A.G. 114 (1992).

                        City Not Liable Absent Agreement for Treatment of Inebriate Injured While Being Assisted by Police. - A city was not liable to a hospital for the cost of treating a habitual inebriate who was injured when he fell while being assisted by city police officers,
                        where there was no express agreement to pay for such services. Nor was there an implied promise to pay, pursuant to a statutory duty, since persons arrested by city police officers, if confined, were confined in the county jail.

                        Constitutionality of Annexation by Local Act Where Essential Service Not Provided. - Annexation to a municipality by a local act of the General Assembly is not invalid constitutionally where the municipality fails to provide one of the many essential

                        Legislature Has Power to Regulate Annexation. - Annexation by a municipal corporation is a political question which is within the power of the state legislature to regulate.

                        Scope of Legislative Discretion. - Enlargement of municipal boundaries by the annexation of new territory, and the consequent extension of corporate jurisdiction, including that of levying taxes, are legitimate subjects of legislation. In the absence
                        of constitutional restriction, the extent to which such legislation shall be enacted, both with respect to the terms and circumstances under which the annexation may be had, and the manner in which it may be made, rests entirely
                        in the discretion of the legislature. Abbott v. Town of Highlands, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 277 S.E.2d 820, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 710</cite>,

                        percent (200%) or less than the most recently published United States Census Bureau poverty thresholds, the governing board of any municipality shall annex by ordinance any area the population of which is no more than ten percent

                        section shall be prepared in substantially the following form: DATE:                To the ______________ (name of governing board) of the (City or Town) of ____________      1. We the undersigned owners of real property believe
                        that the area described in paragraph 2 below meets the requirements of G.S. 160A-31(b1) and respectfully request that the area described in paragraph 2 below be annexed to the (City or Town) of ____________.      2. The area to
                        be annexed is contiguous to the (City or Town) of ____________, and the boundaries of such territory are as follows: ______________________________________________________________________________     (c)  Upon receipt of the petition,
                        the municipal governing board shall cause the clerk of the municipality to investigate the sufficiency thereof and to certify the result of the investigation. For petitions received under subsection (b1) or (j) of this section,
                        the clerk shall receive the evidence provided under subsection (l) of this section before certifying the sufficiency of the petition. Upon receipt of the certification, the municipal governing board shall fix a date for a public
                        hearing on the question of annexation, and shall cause notice of the public hearing to be published once in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality at least 10 days prior to the date of the public hearing; provided,
                        if there be no such paper, the governing board shall have notices posted in three or more public places within the area to be annexed and three or more public places within the municipality.     (d)  At the public hearing persons
                        resident or owning property in the area described in the petition and persons resident or owning property in the municipality shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The governing board shall then determine whether the petition
                        meets the requirements of this section. Upon a finding that the petition that was not submitted under subsection (b1) or (j) of this section meets the requirements of this section, the governing board shall have authority to pass
                        an ordinance annexing the territory described in the petition. The governing board shall have authority to make the annexing ordinance effective immediately or on the June 30 after the date of the passage of the ordinance or the
                        June 30 of the following year after the date of passage of the ordinance.     (d1)  Upon a finding that a petition submitted under subsection (j) of this section meets the requirements of this section, the governing body shall
                        have the authority to adopt an annexation ordinance for the area with an effective date no later than 24 months after the adoption of the ordinance.     (d2)  Upon a finding that a petition submitted under subsection (b1) of this
                        section meets the requirements of this section, the governing body shall, within 60 days of the finding, estimate the capital cost to the municipality of extending water and sewer lines to all parcels within the area covered by
                        the petition and estimate the annual debt service payment that would be required if those costs were financed by a 20-year revenue bond. If the estimated annual debt service payment is less than five percent (5%) of the municipality's
                        annual water and sewer systems revenue for the most recent fiscal year, then the governing body shall within 30 days adopt an annexation ordinance for the area with an effective date no later than 24 months after the adoption of
                        the ordinance. If the estimated annual debt service payment is greater than or equal to five percent (5%) of the municipality's annual water and sewer systems revenue for the most recent fiscal year, then the governing body may
                        adopt a resolution declining to annex the area. If such a resolution is adopted, the governing body shall immediately submit a request to the Local Government Commission to certify that its estimate of the annual debt service payment
                        is reasonable based on established governmental accounting principles.      (1) If the Local Government Commission certifies the estimate, the municipality is not required to annex the area and no petition to annex the area may
                        be submitted under subsection (b1) of this section for 36 months following the certification. During the 36-month period, the municipality shall make ongoing, annual good faith efforts to secure Community Development Block Grants
                        or other grant funding for extending water and sewer service to all parcels in the areas covered by the petition. If sufficient funding is secured so that the estimated capital cost to the municipality for extending water and sewer
                        service, less the funds secured, would result in an annual debt service payment cost to the municipality of less than five percent (5%) of the municipality's annual water and sewer systems revenue for the most recent fiscal year,
                        then the governing body shall within 30 days adopt an annexation ordinance for the area with an effective date no later than 24 months after the adoption of the ordinance.      (2) If the Local Government Commission notifies the
                        governing board that the estimates are not reasonable based on established governmental accounting principles and that a reasonable estimate of the annual debt service payment is less than five percent (5%) of the municipality's
                        annual water and sewer systems revenue for the most recent fiscal year, then the governing body shall within 30 days of the notification adopt an annexation ordinance for the area with an effective date no later than 24 months
                        after the adoption of the ordinance.     (d3)  Municipal services shall be provided to an area annexed under subsections (b1) and (j) of this section in accordance with the requirements of Part 7 of this Article.     (e)  From
                        and after the effective date of the annexation ordinance, the territory and its citizens and property shall be subject to all debts, laws, ordinances and regulations in force in such municipality and shall be entitled to the same
                        privileges and benefits as other parts of such municipality. Real and personal property in the newly annexed territory on the January 1 immediately preceding the beginning of the fiscal year in which the annexation becomes effective
                        is subject to municipal taxes as provided in G.S. 160A-58.10. If the effective date of annexation falls between June 1 and June 30, and the effective date of the privilege license tax ordinance of the annexing municipality is June
                        1, then businesses in the area to be annexed shall be liable for taxes imposed in such ordinance from and after the effective date of annexation.     (f)  For purposes of this section, an area shall be deemed "contiguous" if, at
                        the time the petition is submitted, such area either abuts directly on the municipal boundary or is separated from the municipal boundary by the width of a street or street right-of-way, a creek or river, or the right-of-way of
                        a railroad or other public service corporation, lands owned by the municipality or some other political subdivision, or lands owned by the State of North Carolina. A connecting corridor consisting solely of a street or street right-of-way
                        may not be used to establish contiguity. In describing the area to be annexed in the annexation ordinance, the municipal governing board may include within the description any territory described in this subsection which separates
                        the municipal boundary from the area petitioning for annexation.     (g)  The governing board may initiate annexation of contiguous property owned by the municipality by adopting a resolution stating its intent to annex the property,
                        in lieu of filing a petition. The resolution shall contain an adequate description of the property, state that the property is contiguous to the municipal boundaries and fix a date for a public hearing on the question of annexation.
                        Notice of the public hearing shall be published as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The governing board may hold the public hearing and adopt the annexation ordinance as provided in subsection (d) of this section. 
                          (h)  A city council which receives a petition for annexation under this section may by ordinance require that the petitioners file a signed statement declaring whether or not vested rights with respect to the properties subject
                        to the petition have been established under G.S. 160A-385.1 or G.S. 153A-344.1. If the statement declares that such rights have been established, the city may require petitioners to provide proof of such rights. A statement which
                        declares that no vested rights have been established under G.S. 160A-385.1 or G.S. 153A-344.1 shall be binding on the landowner and any such vested right shall be terminated.     (i)  A municipality has no authority to adopt a
                        resolution or petition itself under this Part for annexation of property it does not own or have any legal interest in. For the purpose of this subsection, a municipality has no legal interest in a State-maintained street unless
                        it owns the underlying fee and not just an easement.     (j)  Using the procedures under this section, the governing board of any municipality may annex by ordinance any distressed area contiguous to its boundaries upon presentation
                        to the governing board of a petition signed by at least one adult resident of at least two-thirds of the resident households located within such area. For purposes of this subsection, a "distressed area" is defined as an area in
                        which at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the households in the area petitioning to be annexed have incomes that are two hundred percent (200%) or less than the most recently published United States Census Bureau poverty thresholds.
                        The municipality may require reasonable proof that the petitioner in fact resides at the address indicated.     (k)  The petition under subsection (j) of this section shall be prepared in substantially the following form: DATE:
                                      To the ______________ (name of governing board) of the (City or Town) of ____________      1. We the undersigned residents of real property believe that the area described in paragraph 2 below meets the requirements
                        of G.S. 160A-31(j) and respectfully request that the area described in paragraph 2 below be annexed to the (City or Town) of____________.      2. The area to be annexed is contiguous to the (City or Town) of ________ ________,

                        For purposes of determining whether the percentage of households in the area petitioning for annexation meets the poverty thresholds under subsections (b1) and (j) of this section, the petitioners shall submit to the municipal governing board any reasonable
                        evidence that demonstrates the area in fact meets the income requirements of that subsection. The evidence presented may include data from the most recent federal decennial census, other official census documents, signed affidavits
                        by at least one adult resident of the household attesting to the household size and income level, or any other documentation verifying the incomes for a majority of the households within the petitioning area. Petitioners may select
                        to submit name, address, and social security number to the clerk, who shall in turn submit the information to the Department of Revenue. Such information shall be kept confidential and is not a public record. The Department shall

                        Deliberate preference for voluntary annexation is incorporated into the law. Town of Hazelwood v. Town of Waynesville, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 89</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 686, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 639</cite>,

                        G.S. 160A-37(e), 160A-49(e), and this section are in pari materia. Conover v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 506</cite>, 256 S.E.2d 216 (1979).

                    <p>
                        No Authorization to Annex Only Part of Area Described. - If the General Assembly had intended to authorize cities proceeding pursuant to a petition for voluntary annexation to annex merely a part of the area described in the petition, it would have so
                        provided, as it has explicitly done in G.S. 160A-37(e) and 160A-49(e). The absence of such statutory authorization, in light of the explicit provisions for it in the involuntary annexation statutes, is cogent evidence that the
                        General Assembly intended a petition for voluntary annexation to stand or fall as a unity. Conover v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 506</cite>, 256 S.E.2d 216 (1979).

                    <p>
                        "Contiguous". - North Carolina annexation statutes do not permit municipality to annex by voluntary means tract of land that is contiguous with its municipal boundaries only by virtue of second tract of land that is being annexed simultaneously. City
                        of Kannapolis v. City of Concord, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 512</cite>, 391 S.E.2d 493 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Standing to Contest Annexation. - Because this section describes a voluntary annexation undertaken at the request of land owners and does not authorize suit by neighboring municipalities, plaintiff town did not have standing to contest the annexation
                        scheme of defendant neighboring town; only if another town owned property in the annexed area, or if both towns were simultaneously attempting to annex controverted property, could there be a justiciable controversy, giving one
                        town standing to contest the annexation by the other, and, even then, G.S. 160A-360 provides a way to resolve such a conflict. Town of Ayden v. Town of Winterville, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite>                        136, 544 S.E.2d 821 (2001).

                        Annexation of Undeveloped Lands Only on Petition. - Large tracts of agricultural or vacant lands, where no evidence of urban development can be shown, should not be annexed in any event, except upon petition of the landowners. Lithium Corp. of Am. v.
                        Town of Bessemer City, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 532</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 574 (1964).

                        Property owners who have signed a voluntary annexation petition have the right to withdraw from the petition at any time up until the governing municipal body has taken action upon the petition by annexing the area described in the petition. Conover v.

                        Resolution of intent is "first mandatory public procedural step" for purposes of the prior jurisdiction rule. Town of Hazelwood v. Town of Waynesville, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 89</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 686, cert. denied,

                    <p>
                        The adoption of a resolution of intent is the critical date for determining whether a municipality utilizing involuntary annexation procedures has prior jurisdiction over the same territory being considered for voluntary annexation by a different municipality.

                        Property Not Contiguous. - Where city sought to annex private property and municipal property, and where municipal property was not contiguous with city but was contiguous to private property, city could not annex municipal property on the theory that
                        the area as a whole was contiguous; the private property and municipal property were annexed by different procedures with independent requirements and could not be considered one whole area for the purpose of satisfying the contiguity
                        requirement. City of Kannapolis v. City of Concord, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 591, 383 S.E.2d 402, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 512</cite>, 391 S.E.2d 493 (1990).

                    <p>
                        At the time town purported to annex defendant counties' property, the property was not contiguous and the attempted annexation was invalid. Town of Valdese v. Burke, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 688, 482 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Effect of Withdrawal. - Where six owners of real property located within the area described in a voluntary annexation petition validly withdrew their signatures from the petition before the annexation ordinance was passed, the city governing body was
                        without jurisdiction to take any further action on the petition as submitted, and the entire ordinance purporting to annex all the area described in the petition was void. Conover v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 506</cite>,
                        256 S.E.2d 216 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Condemnor-County May Enjoin Municipal Annexation Proceeding. - When a county initiates condemnation of property for a sanitary landfill, and the property is being considered for voluntary annexation into a municipality, the county may proceed with the
                        condemnation action. The county is entitled to an injunction enjoining the annexation proceeding, and the property owners and the municipality may raise the proposed annexation in the answer to the condemnation complaint, for appropriate
                        consideration by the court. Yandle v. Mecklenburg County, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 355 S.E.2d 216 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Annexation Held Proper. - City's division of an annexation area into sub-areas did not result in the improper annexation of an "island" not contiguous with the city limits as of the date of the original resolution of intent, although the boundaries of
                        the sub-area, if considered in isolation, rather than as a sub-part of the area originally identified and eventually annexed, were not contiguous with the city limits on the date of the initial resolution. U.S. Cold Storage, Inc.

                    <p>
                        Annexation Held Void. - City's annexation of three developments was void despite utility agreements with the developers barring future lot owners from withdrawing consent to an annexation. No easements were created through the agreements, deeds to non-consenting
                        lot owners did not refer to the agreements, and all owners had to consent under G.S. 160A-31(a). Cunningham v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 86, 711 S.E.2d 477 (2011).

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 2001-37, s. 1, amended subsection (b) by deleting subdivision (b)(5), regarding limitations on the area within the proposed satellite corporate limits. Section 2 of the act made this amendment applicable to
                    the Cities of Marion, Oxford, and Rockingham and the Towns of Calabash, Catawba, Dallas, Godwin, Louisburg, Mocksville, Pembroke, Rutherfordton, and Waynesville only. Session Laws 2001-37, ss. 1 and 2, have been codified as subsection
                    (b1) at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes. Session Laws 2001-438, s. 1, also enacted a subsection (b1), which has been recodified as subsection (b2) at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2002-121, s. 1, provides that subdivision (b)(5) does not apply to the cities of Claremont, Concord, Conover, Newton, Sanford, and Southport, and the Towns of Maiden, Midland, Swansboro, and Warsaw. Session Laws 1997-2, s. 1, provided that
                    subdivision (b)(5) did not apply to the town of Catawba, and Session Laws 2001-72, s. 1 provided the subdivision did not apply to the city of Salisbury. Since subdivision (b)(5) does not apply to more than 10 jurisdictions, the second
                    paragraph of that subdivision has been added at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2007-26, s. 2(a), contained a local modification as to G.S. 160A-58.1(b)(2) and (b)(5). The local modification as to subdivision (b)(5) adds to a local modification that affects ten or more localities. It was codified at this section at the
                    direction of the Revisor of Statutes by inserting "Oak Island" in the second paragraph of subdivision (b)(5).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pursuant to Session Laws 2009-298, s. 1, and at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes, the town of Huntersville has been added to the list of localities in subdivision (b)(5) to which that subdivision is inapplicable.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2013-32, s. 1, amended subsection (b) by deleting subdivision (b)(4), regarding annexation of all of a subdivision. Section 2 deleted the limitation as applicable to the Vidant Family Medical Center. Section 3 of the act made this amendment
                    applicable to the Town of Wallace only.

                    Upon receipt of a petition for annexation under this Part, the city council shall cause the city clerk to investigate the petition, and to certify the results of his investigation. If the clerk certifies that upon investigation the petition appears to
                    be valid, the council shall fix a date for a public hearing on the annexation. Notice of the hearing shall be published once at least 10 days before the date of hearing.

                <p>
                    At the hearing, any person residing in or owning property in the area proposed for annexation and any resident of the annexing city may appear and be heard on the questions of the sufficiency of the petition and the desirability of the annexation. If
                    the council then finds and determines that (i) the area described in the petition meets all of the standards set out in G.S. 160A-58.1(b), (ii) the petition bears the signatures of all of the owners of real property within the area
                    proposed for annexation (except those not required to sign by G.S. 160A-58.1(a)), (iii) the petition is otherwise valid, and (iv) the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the city and of the area proposed for annexation
                    will be best served by the annexation, the council may adopt an ordinance annexing the area described in the petition. The ordinance may be made effective immediately or on any specified date within six months from the date of passage.

                        This Part does not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power in violation of N.C. Const., Art. VIII. Williams v. Town of Grifton, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 199 S.E.2d 288 (1973).

                        The legislature may, without violating the state or federal Constitutions, delegate to a municipality the authority to implement a plan of annexation. Williams v. Town of Grifton, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 462,

                        The guidelines established by this Part are as stringent as those in G.S. 160A-45 et seq., and the discretion conferred upon the municipalities of population less than 5,000 is no greater than that conferred upon municipalities of population of 5,000
                        or greater. Therefore, the contention that the annexation statute is unconstitutional is untenable. Williams v. Town of Grifton, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 199 S.E.2d 288 (1973).

                        Application to Property of Condominium Owners. - Condominium unit owners need municipal services like water, sewage disposal, and police and fire protection just as do homeowners in any new development. It would lead to anomalous results and violate legislative

                        Annexation of territory by a municipality is a legislative and not a judicial act; hence, in the absence of statutory directive, the court, on appeal from an annexation ordinance, cannot divide the territory, annex a part thereof and refuse to annex the
                        remainder. Huntley v. Potter, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 681 (1961).

                        Burden of Showing Noncompliance. - In an annexation proceeding under this Part, the record of the proceedings must show prima facie complete and substantial compliance with the applicable provisions of the statutes; the burden is upon petitioners requesting
                        review of annexation proceedings to show, by competent evidence, failure on the part of the municipality to comply with the statutory requirements as a matter of fact, or irregularity in the proceedings which materially prejudiced
                        the substantive rights of petitioners. Conover v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 506</cite>, 256 S.E.2d 216 (1979).

                        Contiguity is an essential component of the traditional concept of a municipal corporation, which is envisioned as a governmental unit capable of providing essential governmental services to residents within compact borders on a scale adequate to insure
                        "the protection of health, safety, and welfare in areas being intensively used for residential, commercial, industrial, and government purposes or in areas undergoing such development." Imposition of the contiguity requirement
                        is one means of ensuring that the annexation process remains consistent with principles of sound urban development. Hawks v. Town of Valdese, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 1</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 90 (1980).

                        Section 160A-37 provides two different procedural methods for beginning the involuntary annexation process under G.S. 160A-33 to 160A-42, and former G.S. 160A-43 and 160A-44. A municipality may either pass a resolution of consideration one year prior
                        to adopting its resolution of intent, or it may immediately adopt the resolution of intent and postpone the effective date of annexation for at least a year after the ordinance is passed. Town of Hazelwood v. Town of Waynesville,

                        Preference of Landowners Is of No Consequence. - For purposes of the prior jurisdiction rule, annexation proceedings, regardless of their nature, are "equivalent proceedings," and it is of no consequence which town or city the landowners prefer. In fact,
                        it appears to be the very essence of the involuntary annexation procedures that the affected landowners have no choice, as long as the annexing body complies with the applicable statutes. City of Burlington v. Town of Elon College,
                        <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 723</cite>, 314 S.E.2d 534 (1984).

                        Objectives Held Sufficient to Justify Annexation. - Three avowed objectives stated by a town's governing board, namely, (1) essentially all of the town's desirable building sites were exhausted, (2) the tax base was unable to provide the kind of services
                        people needed, and (3) many interested people were unable to participate in town government were sufficient to qualify annexation under this Part. Williams v. Town of Grifton, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite>                        462, 199 S.E.2d 288 (1973).

                        Annexation Proper. - Trial court properly found that a village provided independent administrative, engineering, auditing, legal, and planning services to its residents, and that the village was exploring options for obtaining additional police patrol
                        services, and had committed itself to providing its current and future levels of such services to its residents in a non-discriminatory manner; the trial court found that the village was going to provide some additional services
                        to the area to be annexed, notwithstanding land owners' claim they would receive no additional services whatsoever, and the trial court's order affirming the annexation was proper. Nolan v. Village of Marvin,

                        Village essentially complied with the requirements of G.S. 160A-33 because the village's annexation of property was consistent with the public policy of sound urban development articulated in G.S. 160A-33. Norwood v. Village of Sugar Mt.,

                        Annexation Ordinance Unenforceable. - Appellate court's decision that upheld the trial court's judgment upholding the annexation ordinance was reversed, as the village's annexation ordinance did not provide for meaningful extension of municipal services
                        to the lots subject to annexation, which meant that the village had not substantially complied with the statutory procedures for annexation and that the property owners would suffer material injury, in the form of municipal taxes,
                        if annexation proceeded. Nolan v. Village of Marvin, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 256</cite>, 624 S.E.2d 305 (2006).

                        Municipality Need Not Acquire Private Water and Sewer Systems. - An annexation ordinance may not be attacked on the ground that the municipality has no plans to purchase or finance the purchase of private water and sewer systems existing in the annexed
                        territory, since the mere existence of such private systems within the territory to be annexed does not compel the city to purchase or acquire ownership of them. Huntley v. Potter, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>,
                        122 S.E.2d 681 (1961).

                    <p>
                        Nor Does Mere Extension of Limits or Voluntary Maintenance Appropriate Such Systems. - Where a municipality annexes territory served by private water or sewer lines, the owners of such lines may not recover the value thereof from the municipality in the
                        absence of provisions for payment by contract or ordinance, unless the municipality appropriates such private lines and controls them as proprietor; the mere extension of the city limits to include such lines or the voluntary maintenance
                        of such lines by the city does not amount to an appropriation of such lines by the municipality. Huntley v. Potter, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 681 (1961).

                        Annexation Procedure Constitutional. - The procedure for annexation by cities of 5,000 or more, G.S. 160A-45 et seq., does not violate N.C. Const., Art. I,
                        <span class="s2">

                        The procedure for annexation by cities of 5,000 or more does not authorize a taking of private property without just compensation in violation of the due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. V or the law of the land provision of N.C. Const., Art. I,

                        thus provides adequate due process safeguards to assure that citizens in the annexed area get municipal services on a nondiscriminatory basis. Moody v. Town of Carrboro, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 318</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 265

                        Provisions Not Unconstitutional as Special or Local Legislation. - Sections 160A-45 through 160A-50 are not unconstitutional as special or local legislation even though as enacted the statutes exempted certain counties from their application, because
                        municipal annexation is not one of the subject matter areas which the Constitution requires to be accomplished by general or uniformly applicable laws. In re City of Durham Annexation Ordinance Numbered 5991 for Area A,

                        Central purpose behind the annexation procedure is to assure that, in return for the added financial burden of municipal taxation, the residents receive the benefits of all the major services available to municipal residents. Cockrell v. City of Raleigh,

                        The minimum requirements of the annexation statute are that the city provide information which is necessary to allow the public and the courts to determine whether the municipality has committed itself to provide a nondiscriminatory level of service.

                        The legislature has recognized the importance of adequate water and sewer facilities to the end of quality urban development and specifically required that certain present and proposed water and sewer facilities be shown in the report. That the legislature
                        did not include proposed sewer interceptors among those certain facilities is a matter of legislative concern. Trask v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 17, 306 S.E.2d 832 (1983),

                        Prior Jurisdiction Doctrine. - Adherence to the prior jurisdiction doctrine is not only consistent with the majority rule, but is in keeping with the spirit and intent of the annexation statutes. City of Burlington v. Town of Elon College,
                        <cite

                        A county may not exercise jurisdiction over any part of a city located within its borders. Davidson County v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 252</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 553 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Statutes do not give a county authority over provision of sewer services within a city, or over newly annexed areas of the city which also lie in the county. Davidson County v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 252</cite>,
                        362 S.E.2d 553 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Use of City-Owned Sewage Treatment Plant Without Prior Approval of County. - Since county had no authority to restrict or regulate city's provision of sewer service to its residents, the city could use city-owned sewage treatment plant located outside
                        the city but within the county, which was upgraded pursuant to the county's special use permit, with a condition attached to the permit requiring the county's prior approval of service to county citizens, to meet its statutory
                        mandate to provide sewer service to residents in newly annexed areas without seeking the county's prior approval, even though the facility was located in the county. Davidson County v. City of High Point,

                            class="nc_code">321 N.C. 252</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 553 (1987).

                        Where one municipality institutes valid annexation proceedings first, that municipality should be given priority under the prior jurisdiction rule, and subsequent annexation proceedings, of whatever nature, are of no force and effect. City of Burlington
                        v. Town of Elon College, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 723</cite>, 314 S.E.2d 534 (1984).

                    <p>
                        Meaningful Benefit Provided to Annexed Residents. - Town's annexation was valid because: (1) according to the annexation report, the town would extend its municipal services on a non-discriminatory basis, thus satisfying the statutory requirements under
                        G.S. 160A-47(3); (2) the town annexation provided police protection, a service that promoted the health, safety, and welfare of residents within the annexed area; (3) such protection provided a meaningful benefit to the annexed
                        residents and furthered the public policies underlying the annexation statutes, under G.S. 160A-45; and (4) property owners were bound by a trial court's factual finding that the owners had not shown that the annexation area currently
                        received police services that were comparable to those that the town would provide the annexation area after the annexation became effective. Nolan v. Town of Weddington, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                        486, 642 S.E.2d 261 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Preference of Landowners Is of No Consequence. - For purposes of the prior jurisdiction rule, annexation proceedings, regardless of their nature, are "equivalent proceedings," and it is of no consequence which town or city the landowners prefer. In fact,
                        it appears to be the very essence of the involuntary annexation procedures that the affected landowners have no choice, as long as the annexing body complies with the applicable statutes. City of Burlington v. Town of Elon College,
                        <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 723</cite>, 314 S.E.2d 534 (1984).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Discovery. - Though discovery in annexation proceedings is not altogether forbidden, its scope is necessarily limited by the nature of the proceeding. Campbell v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 252,
                        319 S.E.2d 323, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 492</cite>, 322 S.E.2d 553 (1984).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reports' Statement of Policy Objectives Held Sufficient. - A statement in an annexation plan report that the annexation was designed to promote sound urban development and assure adequate provision of government services was a sufficient statement of
                        the policy objectives to be met by the annexation to comply with this section. Moody v. Town of Carrboro, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 318</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 265 (1980), rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 728</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Judicial Review. - The General Assembly has provided for limited judicial review of annexation ordinances. Section 160A-50 provides that a property owner in the annexed area may seek judicial review of the ordinance. Upon such review, the superior court
                        may consider only whether (1) the statutory procedure was not followed, or (2) the provisions of G.S. 160A-47 were not met, or (3) the provisions of G.S. 160A-48 have not been met. Additionally, petitioner must carry the burden
                        of showing both noncompliance with statutory requirements and procedure and material injury flowing from such noncompliance. McKenzie v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 393,

                        Coincidence of Boundary Requirement. - In considering the coincidence of boundary requirement, the entire area proposed for annexation must be viewed as a whole, rather than as various component portions. Huyck Corp. v. Town of Wake Forest,

                        Classification of Landlocked and Fronting Lots in Single Ownership as Single Lot. - It is not unreasonable and beyond the statutory definition to classify a landlocked lot and its fronting lot in single ownership as a single lot in residential use where
                        only the fronting lot contains "a habitable dwelling unit." Adams-Millis Corp. v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 169 S.E.2d 496 (1969).

                        Annexation Proper. - Village essentially complied with the requirements of G.S. 160A-41 because the village met the literal contiguity requirements in annexing an area.

                        Mobile Homes as "Constructed" for "Residential Purposes" Requirement. - Petitioners/property owners failed to overcome the presumption that the City substantially complied with G.S. 160A-48(c)(3) when it moved to annex disputed areas; mobile homes used
                        to meet the "urban purposes" percentage requirement were "constructed" on the lots pursuant to "residential purposes" as defined by subdivision (2) of this section, and the deletion of a condemned home, originally included as a
                        "habitable" residence, did not affect the calculations or the city's compliance. Bali Co. v. City of Kings Mt., <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 277, 517 S.E.2d 208 (1999).

                        Tract Classified as Residential Despite Growing of Grass Thereon for Cattle Feed. - A city could classify a 1.83 acre tract with a rented house located on it as one lot used for residential purposes, despite the fact that on two separate parts of the
                        lot fescue and sudex grass was grown and a person living in the neighborhood had been allowed to mow this grass, bale it and feed it to his cows. Southern Glove Mfg. Co. v.

                        Standard of Review Under This Section. - The trial court's order affirming a town annexation ordinance had to be vacated where the court applied the material prejudice standard of review to the adequacy of maps contained in the town report as well as
                        to the questions of solid waste collection and the financing of services instead of determining whether or not the town complied with this section in formulating and carrying out its annexation plan; procedural irregularities under
                        G.S. 160A-37 are to be evaluated under a "material prejudice" standard, while violations of either this section or G.S. 160A-36 are to be viewed in light of compliance or lack thereof and, if necessary, result in appropriate amendment.

                        Municipality, as a condition precedent to the right to annex, must file a report showing on its face strict compliance with statutory requirements, and upon review in superior court has the burden of sustaining the regularity, adequacy, veracity and validity
                        of the report and annexation ordinance by competent evidence. Huntley v. Potter, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 681 (1961).

                        The legislature has empowered municipal governing boards to amend the report required by this section, in order to make changes in the plans for serving the area proposed to be annexed, so long as such changes meet the requirements of this section. Gregory

                        Plans Held in Compliance with Subdivision (3)a. - Plans which contained (1) information with respect to the current level of services within town, (2) a commitment to provide substantially the same level of services in the annexation area, and (3) information
                        as to how the extension of services would be financed set forth sufficient information to allow the public and the courts to determine that the town had committed itself to provide a nondiscriminatory level of services to the annexed
                        area and to establish compliance with subdivision (3)a. Huyck Corp. v. Town of Wake Forest, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 356 S.E.2d 599, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 589</cite>,

                        Failure to Call for Increase in Personnel in Plans. - Plans for services to the annexed area are not defective in failing to call for any significant increase in personnel where the record is devoid of evidence showing any need for increased personnel.
                        Adams-Millis Corp. v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 169 S.E.2d 496, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 681</cite> (1969).

                        The fact that the metes and bounds description in a resolution of intent to annex failed to close, because one small piece of property owned by a person who did not join the petition for review was not included within the resolution of intent, was not
                        fatal to the validity of the annexation ordinance where the resolution of intent and the published notice of public hearing made full reference to a map filed in the office of the clerk of the city and available for public inspection
                        of the area proposed to be annexed, and this map and a map published in the newspaper notice of the public hearing showed all the property proposed to be annexed. Conover v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 506</cite>,

                        This section does not make it incumbent upon the municipality to justify annexation other than to the extent of its ability to serve the areas to be annexed. Williams v. Town of Grifton, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite>                        462, 199 S.E.2d 288 (1973).

                        While the extent to which an area needs municipal services is among the factors to be considered in a decision to annex, the statute requires only that a city demonstrate an ability to serve the area to be annexed. Thompson v. City of Salisbury,

                        Map Requirement Met. - Annexation report complied with statutory map requirements where the map indicated the current town limits, the area of proposed annexation, and the current town limits of satellite annexation, as well as major roads and property
                        boundaries; there was no requirement that the report contain a sealed map where the town did not plan to extend water and sewer into an annexed area. Sonopress, Inc. v.

                        Remedy Where Municipality Has Not Carried Out Service Plans Adopted under Subdivision (3). - The statutory remedy for owners of property in annexed territory where the municipality has not followed through on its service plans adopted under the provisions
                        of subdivision (3) of this section and G.S. 160A-37 is by writ of mandamus. Safrit v. Costlow, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 680</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 252 (1967).

                    <p>
                        Record Held to Sustain Finding of Compliance. - Where the record disclosed the plans of the municipality for extending municipal services to the area annexed, itemizing the cost, and obtaining such cost from current taxes, the record supported a finding
                        by the court of compliance with this section, and such finding would not be disturbed in the absence of evidence to the contrary of sufficient weight to overcome the prima facie presumption of regularity. Huntley v. Potter,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 681 (1961).

                    <p>
                        Evidence supporting the plans set out in the report, and no evidence that the service would not be adequate, was sufficient to support the conclusion that the police protection requirement of this section would be met. Williams v. Town of Grifton,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 199 S.E.2d 288 (1973).

                        Annexation ordinance and report met the requirements of this section and G.S. 160A-37. Williams v. Town of Grifton, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 611, 207 S.E.2d 275 (1974).

                        A second public hearing after amendment is not required by this section. Adams-Millis Corp. v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 169 S.E.2d 496, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 681</cite>                        (1969).

                    <p>
                        There is no requirement that a second public hearing be held on an amended annexation proposal, when that amendment is adopted to achieve compliance with this section, pursuant to the authority granted in G.S. 160A-37(e). Gregory v. Town of Plymouth,
                        <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 431, 299 S.E.2d 232, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 544</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 237 (1983).

                    <p>
                        There is no requirement that a second public hearing be held on an amended annexation proposal, when that amendment is adopted to achieve compliance with G.S. 160A-35, and G.S. 160A-35 is the corollary to G.S. 160A-47, with the only significant difference
                        in these statutes being that G.S. 160A-35 applies to cities less than 5,000 and G.S. 160A-47 applies to cities of 5,000 or more. Arnold v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 542,
                        652 S.E.2d 40 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 354</cite>, 663 S.E.2d 312 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Town Not Required to Provide Service. - Language in annexation ordinances to the effect that since water service then provided to the annexed areas by plaintiff was comparable to that provided by the town, the town would not be required to appropriate
                        funds to extend water and sewer lines to the annexed area was required by G.S. 160A-37(e)(3) and subdivision (3)b to insure that residents of the area to be annexed would have access to comparable water service; in no way did this
                        serve as a promise to be rightfully relied upon that the town would not in the future construct its own water lines within the annexed area or that plaintiff had the exclusive right to furnish water service there. Carolina Water
                        Serv., Inc. v. Town of Atlantic Beach, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 464 S.E.2d 317 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Additional Services Not Required. - Annexation report complied with statutory requirements where it stated that no additional police officers were required by the annexation and that roads would continue to be maintained by the State; evidence supported
                        the town's statements that additional police officers were not required and that the State would continue to provide road maintenance. Sonopress, Inc. v. Town of Weaverville, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite>                        492, 562 S.E.2d 32, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 751</cite>, 565 S.E.2d 671 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Annexation Proper. - Trial court properly found that a village provided independent administrative, engineering, auditing, legal, and planning services to its residents, and that the village was exploring options for obtaining additional police patrol
                        services, and had committed itself to providing its current and future levels of such services to its residents in a non-discriminatory manner; the trial court found that the village was going to provide some additional services
                        to the area to be annexed, notwithstanding land owners' claim they would receive no additional services whatsoever, and the trial court's order affirming the annexation was proper. Nolan v. Village of Marvin,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 615 S.E.2d 898 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Village essentially complied with the requirements of G.S. 160A-35 because a map prepared by the village as part of its original report clearly included a one-acre tract of land which was ultimately annexed. Moreover, the annexation ordinance would have
                        extended the same police protection, waste collection services, and recreation department facilities that were then provided within the village. Norwood v. Village of Sugar Mt., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C.

                    <p>
                        Annexation Ordinance Unenforceable. - Appellate court's decision that upheld the trial court's judgment upholding the annexation ordinance was reversed, as the village's annexation ordinance did not provide for meaningful extension of municipal services
                        to the lots subject to annexation, which meant that the village had not substantially complied with the statutory procedures for annexation and that the property owners would suffer material injury, in the form of municipal taxes,
                        if annexation proceeds. Nolan v. Village of Marvin, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 256</cite>, 624 S.E.2d 305 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Financing Statement Not Required. - Town did not need to set out a method for the financing of additional services in its annexation report where the town's statement that no additional services were required was supported by competent evidence in the
                        record; a financing statement was required only if there was to be an extension of services. Sonopress, Inc. v. Town of Weaverville, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 562 S.E.2d 32, cert. denied,

                            A city has statutory authority to annex areas both contiguous and non-contiguous to its primary corporate limits. It must stand ready to provide sewer service (among other services) to newly annexed areas on substantially the same basis and in the same
                            manner in which these services are provided to the rest of the city. Davidson County v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 252</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 553 (1987).

                            Use of City-Owned Sewage Treatment Plant Without Prior Approval of County. - Since county had no authority to restrict or regulate city's provision of sewer service to its residents, the city could use city-owned sewage treatment plant located outside
                            the city but within the county, which was upgraded pursuant to the county's special use permit, with a condition attached to the permit requiring the county's prior approval of service to county citizens, to meet its statutory
                            mandate to provide sewer service to residents in newly annexed areas without seeking the county's prior approval, even though the facility was located in the county. Davidson County v. City of High Point,

                            Discovery. - Judicial review of an annexation ordinance is a limited judicial review, with few similarities to ordinary civil actions which are initiated, tried and adjudicated in a different manner and for which the Rules of Civil Procedure were mostly
                            devised. Nevertheless, since the court reviewing annexation proceedings is explicitly authorized to receive evidence as to the city's compliance with the various procedures prescribed, as to its annexation plan meeting the
                            requisites of this section, and as to the area involved being eligible for annexation under G.S. 160A-48, in those instances where discovery may illuminate these issues it is authorized under the Rules of Civil Procedure. Campbell

                            Nowhere in this section does the concept of equality with "average service" appear in reference to the municipal services to be supplied by the annexing municipality. No reasonable reading of the statutory language permits that inference. In re City of

                            not be delegated to others by the city so as to relieve the city of the duty. If other parties are obligated to the city to perform such duty, the city must enforce the obligation directly against such parties and may not be
                            otherwise relieved of its primary duty to the area which it seeks to make a part of the city for all other purposes. In re Annexation Ordinance, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 633</cite>, 122 S.E.2d

                            When a village proposed to involuntarily annex an area which contained privately owned streets, owners of property on the private streets could not defeat the annexation by denying the village's employees access to the private streets, if the owners chose
                            to keep the streets private and the area were annexed, because it was not the intent of the general assembly, in adopting G.S. 160A-47(3), to provide private communities with an avenue to defeat annexation by denying access
                            to municipal employees, when all other statutory requirements were met, as this would create unacceptable inequities between the rights of citizens in private communities and those living on public roads. Pinewild Project Ltd.

                            When a village proposed to involuntarily annex an area which contained privately owned streets, the village's annexation plan met the requirements of G.S. 160A-47(3) when the village proposed that, if the street's owners dedicated the street to the village,
                            the village would provide the same level of municipal services as the village provided to residents living on public streets because these options were substantially consistent with how the village currently treated public

                            Statement of Plans for Extension of Services. - In its annexation report the city must include a statement setting forth the plans of the municipality for extending certain enumerated municipal services to the area to be annexed on the date of annexation
                            on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as such services are provided within the rest of the municipality prior to annexation. Food Town Stores, Inc. v. City of Salisbury, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 21</cite>,

                            Other Anticipated Services Need Not Be Included. - In a municipal annexation proceeding the city is not required to include in its annexation report plans for extending into the proposed annexation area municipal services other than those enumerated in
                            subdivision (3) of this section. Cockrell v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 479</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 770 (1982).

                            The legislative intent expressed in subdivision (3) requires extension of a variety of municipal services, all of which are required for the public health and safety. Public transportation and parks and recreational facilities do not fall within this
                            classification of service. In re Annexation Ordinance No. 1219, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 303 S.E.2d 380, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 820</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Since plans and procedures concerning transportation are not required by law, a reviewing court has no jurisdiction to hear evidence on this issue. Parkwood Ass'n v.

                            Only Major Municipal Services. - The required information is not that of plans for extending all municipal services, but only the "major" municipal services. Cockrell v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 479</cite>,

                        <p>
                            City bus service and TV service are not "major" municipal services required to be addressed in the annexation report. Cockrell v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 479</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 770 (1982).

                            The respondent city was not required to file a new services plan under this section although the annexation area changed during subsequent revisions to the annexation ordinance, where the only significant change to the services plan was the scope of its
                            coverage - the services for petitioners remained the same - and where the city was bound by the terms of the services plan as amended under principles of equitable estoppel. Bowers v. City of Thomasville,

                            and (3) the method by which the city will finance the extension of these services. In re Annexation Ordinance No. 300-X, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 549</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 470 (1981).

                            which the city will finance the extension of these services. With this minimal information, both the city council and the public can make an informed decision of the costs and benefits of the proposed annexation, a reviewing
                            court can determine whether the city has committed itself to a nondiscriminating level of services, and the residents and the courts have a benchmark against which to measure the level of services which the residents receive
                            within the statutory period. Cockrell v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 479</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 770 (1982).

                            Service Is Municipal Even If Performed by Another. - A service, such as water or sewer service, is a "municipal service" even though it is performed or furnished by an independent authority or by franchise. Cockrell v. City of Raleigh,
                            <cite

                            Service Must Still Be Included in Plan. - If the municipal service is one enumerated in subdivision (3) of this section, it must be included in the annexation report, even though it is provided by an independent authority or under a franchise agreement.

                        <p>
                            The requirement that the annexation report contain a statement setting forth the plans for extending each major municipal service extends to a major service "performed within the municipality," not performed by the municipality. Cockrell v. City of Raleigh,
                            <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 479</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 770 (1982).

                            Plans Should Be Stated Fully and in Detail. - The report of plans for extension of services is the cornerstone of the annexation procedure under this Part, and to be of greatest possible benefit, the plans for services should be stated as fully and in
                            as much detail as resources of the municipality reasonably permit. Cockrell v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 479</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 770 (1982).

                            Response time is only one of many factors that enters into the court's consideration of whether an annexation report reflects plans to provide certain required municipal services on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as in the pre-annexation
                            city area. In re City of Durham Annexation Ordinance No. 5791, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 311 S.E.2d 898 (1984).

                            Time for Implementing Extension of Services. - It would appear from a reading of G.S. 160A-49(h) that a city annexing territory has one year, and possibly 15 months, to implement its plan for extending services to an annexed area. In re Ordinance of Annexation

                            Factors Affecting Whether a Plan Is Discriminatory. - A town's established policies for the provision of municipal services within pre-existing municipal limits should be taken into account when determining whether a proposed plan for extension of services
                            to annexed territories is discriminatory. Matheson v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 402 S.E.2d 140 (1991).

                            Plan Held Sufficient. - Trial court did not err in finding that city's report of plans for the extension of police protection into annexed area met the requirements of this section; the city made a prima facie showing of substantial compliance where it
                            promised to provide a full range of police protection on the same basis and manner as in the present municipality and where the report then outlined the specific services it currently provided, to include a regular patrol division,

                            When a city proposed the involuntary annexation of certain real property, it had to determine the use of that property at the time it prepared the service plan required by G.S. 160A-47, to determine if it complied with the urban usage percentages required

                            There are many variables that affect the level of fire protection afforded to different areas of a municipality: height and size of buildings, construction materials, proximity of buildings to one another and street pattern, among others. In re City of

                            Police Protection Provided. - Town's annexation was valid because: (1) according to the annexation report, the town would extend its municipal services on a non-discriminatory basis, thus satisfying the statutory requirements under G.S. 160A-47(3); (2)
                            the town annexation provided police protection, a service that promoted the health, safety, and welfare of residents within the annexed area; (3) such protection provided a meaningful benefit to the annexed residents and furthered
                            the public policies underlying the annexation statutes, under G.S. 160A-45; and (4) property owners were bound by a trial court's factual finding that the owners had not shown that the annexation area currently received police
                            services that were comparable to those that the town would provide the annexation area after the annexation became effective. Nolan v. Town of Weddington, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                            486, 642 S.E.2d 261 (2007).

                            Regardless of the level of services that county residents receive through a private contractor prior to annexation, the city is only required to provide annexed territories with substantially the same level of services as are enjoyed in other areas of
                            the city. Matheson v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 402 S.E.2d 140 (1991).

                            An increase in the police force proportional to the increase in the population attributable to annexation is a sufficiently sophisticated plan for the provision of services to meet the requirements of subdivision (3)a of this section. Matheson v. City

                            Where city planned to hire three additional sworn officers to maintain its current ratio of one officer for every 486 citizens, the plan was sufficient to meet the requirements of subdivision (3)a of this section. Matheson v. City of Asheville,

                            Full Compliance as to Police and Fire Protection Shown. - Record of annexation proceedings showed prima facie full compliance with this section in regard to extension of police and fire protection to the area to be annexed. In re Annexation Ordinance,
                            <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 633</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 690 (1961).

                        <p>
                            City had shown prima facie compliance with the statute by proposing to provide fire protection services to the annexed area under the same plan as such services are provided to the pre-annexation portions of the city, and similar response times should
                            be anticipated. Matheson v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 402 S.E.2d 140 (1991).

                            When a city proposed to annex certain land, the city's proposal for the extension of police services to the annexed land met the requirements of G.S. 160A-47 because the plan addressed the level of services currently provided in the city and committed
                            to provide substantially the same level of services to the annexed land, and this was all that the applicable statute required. Arnold v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite>                            542, 652 S.E.2d 40 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 354</cite>, 663 S.E.2d 312 (2008).

                            Response time for the fire services is only one of many factors that determines whether an annexation report complies with statutory requirements for the extension of fire protection services. That an annexation report did not include an average response
                            time did not preclude a finding of compliance with the statute. Matheson v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 402 S.E.2d 140 (1991).

                            City Must Plan to Maintain Streets. - So far as an annexation proceeding is concerned, the primary duty of street maintenance in an area after annexation is upon the city, and it must in good faith make plans to maintain the streets, whether paved or
                            unpaved, on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as such services are provided within the rest of the municipality prior to annexation. In re Annexation Ordinance, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 633</cite>,

                            May Not Limit Its Duty to Streets Meeting Certain Standards. - A municipality may not limit its obligations to maintain streets in the area to be annexed by it to those streets which are improved to stipulated standards by the landowners and developers
                            in the area. Any obligation of the landowners and developers to the city to improve the streets is a matter between them and the municipality and is irrelevant to the question of the sufficiency of the annexation ordinance
                            to meet the requirements of the statute. In re Annexation Ordinance, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 633</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 690 (1961).

                        <p>
                            Even if the property owners and developers in the area to be annexed are under a duty to the city to pave all streets and provide storm sewers and curbs and gutters, the city is in no position to rely on this obligation in an annexation proceeding and
                            thereby shift to others the duty which this Article imposes on the city as a condition precedent to annexation. In re Annexation Ordinance, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 633</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 690

                            Specificity Concerning Street Maintenance. - A revised annexation plan report was sufficiently specific with respect to extension of street maintenance services where it detailed what services were provided in the annexing town and stated that all such
                            services would be provided in the annexed area, and was not deficient in failing to provide for the extension of water and sewer lines where this was not a service provided by the town to anyone but was a duty vested with an
                            independent water authority. Moody v. Town of Carrboro, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 318</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 265 (1980), rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 728</cite>, 274 S.E.2d 230

                            (3)b and (3)c of this section even though no plan or associated timetables had been identified for the water supply. Matheson v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 156,

                            Failure to Show Extension Was a Major Water Main. - Where the plaintiffs offered no evidence from which the trial court or appellate court could ascertain in this instance that the twelve-inch water extension was a "major water main," and the policy requiring
                            these petitioners to pay for the cost of water line extensions to their property was consistent with the policy of water line extensions within the pre-existing municipal limits, the trial court was not in error in concluding
                            the town had substantially complied with all the relevant provisions of this section. Wallace v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 378 S.E.2d 225 (1989).

                            that the city's plan for providing services to the area it proposed to annex did not provide statutorily required sewer service. Briggs v.

                            an ordinance null and void. However, in order for a trial court to properly declare an ordinance null and void under G.S. 160A-50(g)(4), it must specifically find that "the ordinance cannot be corrected by remand" as opposed
                            to finding that "the ordinance is not likely to be corrected on remand." Because the trial court failed to make the appropriate finding, perhaps acting under a misapprehension of applicable law, the matter was remanded to the
                            trial court for appropriate findings to support one of the statutory grounds under G.S. 160A-50(g). Fix v. City of Eden, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 622 S.E.2d 647 (2005).

                            Duties under Section. - The requirements of G.S. 160A-47 are that plans for extension to the area to be annexed of all major municipal services performed within the municipality at the time of annexation is a condition precedent to annexation. The minimum
                            requirements of G.S. 160A-47 are that the city provide information which is necessary to allow the public and the courts to determine whether the municipality has committed itself to provide a nondiscriminatory level of service
                            and to allow a reviewing court to determine after the fact whether the municipality has timely provided such services. A city need only substantially comply with G.S. 160A-47. A city is required to provide major municipal services
                            under G.S. 160A-47, and its performance of that duty may not be made to depend upon a doubtful contingency. Fix v. City of Eden, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 622 S.E.2d 647 (2005).

                            Subdivision (3)d requires only that the method of financing be disclosed, not that the precise source of each dollar be pinpointed. In re Annexation Ordinance No. 300-X, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 549</cite>, 284 S.E.2d

                            Use of Federal Funds to Finance Extension of Services. - Although a city's proposals with reference to the financing of the extension of services into the area to be annexed contemplated the use of certain federal funds in connection with such financing,
                            the method set forth in plans to finance extension of the services into the areas to be annexed constituted compliance with subdivision (3)d. Dunn v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 542</cite>,

                            Budgeting of Funds at Time of Trial Held Unnecessary. - Since subdivision (3) of this section requires only that the annexing city file a statement showing how it will provide and finance municipal services to the annexed area, and since there is no requirement
                            that available services be duplicated, the City of Goldsboro, in annexing a federal air force base, was not required to have funds budgeted at the time of trial to provide municipal services to the base in the event the federal
                            government ceased providing those services, where the plan of annexation was based upon sound estimates of anticipated expenditures and revenues. In re Ordinance of Annexation No. 1977-4, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 1</cite>,

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 2011-363, s. 3.1, which amended this section by adding subsection (c), effective July 27, 2011, and applicable to annexations of property used for bona fide farm purposes that were initiated by municipalities
                    on or after that date or pending on that date, was contingent upon House Bill 845, 2011 Regular Session, becoming law. House Bill 845 was enacted as Session Laws 2011-396.

                            Particular Facts Control in Doubtful Cases. - When compliance with the statutory requirements is in doubt, the determination of whether an area is used for a purpose qualifying it for annexation will depend upon the particular facts of each case. Scovill

                            This section does not specify any particular method of calculation for determination of compliance with statutorily mandated requirements and the reasonableness of the method chosen is to be determined in light of the particular circumstances of the questioned
                            annexation proceedings. Lowe v. Town of Mebane, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 332 S.E.2d 739 (1985).

                            Contiguous Area and Coincidence of Boundary Requirements Held Met. - For case holding that where each of three portions included in proposed annexation area was contiguous to the existing town boundary, and, by using a railroad strip as a connector, were
                            contiguous to each other, when viewed as an entire area, the area was contiguous to the boundaries of the town as they existed at the commencement of the annexation proceedings and that the required coincidence of boundaries
                            existed, see Huyck Corp. v. Town of Wake Forest, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 356 S.E.2d 599, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 589</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 139 (1988).

                            Reason for Providing for Judicial Review. - The difficulties of applying the standards of this section in extreme cases were the reason the Municipal Government Study Commission recommended a provision for court review, set out in G.S. 160A-38, to determine
                            whether the agency making the decision made a reasonable decision in accord with statutory standards. Lithium Corp. of Am. v. Town of Bessemer City, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 532</cite>, 135

                            The trial court's order affirming a town annexation ordinance had to be vacated where the court applied the material prejudice standard of review to the adequacy of maps contained in the town report as well as to the questions of solid waste collection
                            and the financing of services instead of determining whether or not the town complied with this section in formulating and carrying out its annexation plan; procedural irregularities under G.S. 160A-37 are to be evaluated under
                            a "material prejudice" standard, while violations of either G.S. 160A-35 or this section are to be viewed in light of compliance or lack thereof and, if necessary, result in appropriate amendment. Sonopress, Inc. v. Town of

                            Annexation of Area in Another Municipality Prohibited. - Any new or amended proceeding by a town correcting procedural irregularities would be an exercise in futility after the disputed area became a part of another city, because after that date any attempt
                            by the town to annex the disputed area would be in violation of this statute, which prohibits the annexation of an area already included within the boundary of another incorporated municipality. Town of Hudson v. City of Lenoir,
                            <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 156</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 443 (1971).

                            Summary judgment was proper in case involving a determination of prior jurisdiction between two towns' competing resolutions of intent where one municipality had sought to involuntarily annex two acres within the boundaries of the other. Town of Spencer
                            v. Town of E. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 124</cite>, 522 S.E.2d 297 (1999).

                        <p>
                            Competing Resolutions of Intent and Priority Jurisdiction. - A resolution of intent to annex territory which includes any territory already within the boundaries of another municipality is void and will lose priority to an intervening and competing valid
                            resolution of intent; the elements listed in this section are "essential elements" with regard to a "prior jurisdiction" determination. Town of Spencer v. Town of E. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 124</cite>,
                            522 S.E.2d 297 (1999).

                        <p>
                            Territory which is contiguous solely to the "satellite corporate limits" fails to satisfy the requirement of subdivision (b)(1) of this section that the area to be annexed in an involuntary annexation proceeding be contiguous or adjacent to the municipal
                            boundaries of the city which seeks annexation. Territory contiguous solely to "satellite corporate limits" is not eligible for annexation until such "satellite corporate limits" become "a part of the primary corporate limits."
                            This occurs in accord with G.S. 160A-58.6 when, through annexation of intervening territory, the boundaries of the satellite area and those of the primary town area touch. Hawks v. Town of Valdese,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">299 N.C. 1</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 90 (1980).

                        <p>
                            If a town wishes to annex involuntarily two unannexed areas on either side of the satellite area, it must first annex the area which abuts directly on both the primary corporate limits and the satellite corporate limits. Only after this intervening territory
                            has been successfully annexed is the area which presently abuts solely on satellite corporate limits eligible for annexation. Hawks v. Town of Valdese, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 1</cite>, 261
                            S.E.2d 90 (1980).

                            Coincidence of Boundary Requirement. - In considering the coincidence of boundary requirement, the entire area proposed for annexation must be viewed as a whole, rather than as various component portions. Huyck Corp. v. Town of Wake Forest,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 356 S.E.2d 599 (1987).

                            Purposes Underlying Subsection (b) Subverted. - Superior court properly remanded town's annexation ordinance for amendment of its proposed boundaries, where although the literal contiguity requirements of subsection (b) of this section and G.S. 160A-41(1)
                            were apparently satisfied by the town's ordinance, the town's compliance with the literal requirements of these statutes resulted in the subversion of the purposes underlying subsection (b), since the town's intentional gerrymandering
                            of the annexation boundary created isolated islands connected to the town by a single narrow corridor of land. Amick v. Town of Stallings, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 64, 382 S.E.2d
                            221 (1989).

                        <p>
                            When a town proposed to annex certain land, it did not comply with the purpose of the standards in G.S. 160A-36(b), to provide essential government services within compact borders, even though it technically complied with the one-eighth contiguity requirement
                            of G.S. 160A-36(b)(2), because it sought to annex certain noncontiguous valuable property by connecting it to the town by a narrow strip of land, surrounded on either side by nonannexed property, thus creating the potential
                            for confusion in the provision of emergency and other services, and this was an impermissible "shoestring" annexation. Hughes v. Town of Oak Island, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 175,

                            in the area must be in actual use, other than for agriculture, and (2) the subdivision test, i.e., that not less than 60% of the acreage which is in residential use, if any, and is vacant must consist of lots and tracts of
                            five acres or less in size. Lithium Corp. of Am. v. Town of Bessemer City, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 532</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 574 (1964).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The criteria in subsection (c) are known as the "use" test and the "subdivision" text. Thompson v. City of Salisbury, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 616, 211 S.E.2d 856 (1975).

                        <p>
                            Subsection (c) contains two tests for determining the availability for annexation, the use test and the subdivision test. American Greetings Corp. v. Town of Alexander Mills, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 727,

                        <p>
                            Both Tests Must Be Complied With. - The fact that the General Assembly connected the two test clauses in subsection (c) of this section with the conjunctive "and," and the clear abuses and hardships which a literal application of the use test, if alone
                            applied, would produce, leads to the conclusion that the legislative intent is that both tests be complied with. Lithium Corp. of Am. v. Town of Bessemer City, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 532</cite>,

                            Both tests established by the General Assembly must be met in order for an area to meet the statutory standard. Adams-Millis Corp. v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 169 S.E.2d 496.

                            Both the "use" test and the "subdivision" test must be met before an area can be classified as urban. Scovill Mfg. Co. v. Town of Wake Forest, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 15, 293 S.E.2d 240 (1982).

                        <p>
                            Application of Tests in Subsection (c). - The use and subdivision tests prescribed by subsection (c) of this section yield accurate results only if applied to a land area which encompasses only unannexed territory. This is so because these tests require
                            a determination of the percentage of lots being used for "urban purposes" and the percentage of "total acreage" subdivided into lots of five acres or less. Such percentage figures will be skewed and inaccurate if not based
                            on data from all the acreage and lots encompassed by the land area under consideration. Hawks v. Town of Valdese, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 1</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 90 (1980).

                            Application of Both Tests May Cause Absurd Results in Extreme Cases. - Literal insistence upon the application of both tests in subsection (c) might in some extreme and improbable circumstances bring about absurd results adverse to municipalities. Lithium

                            Determining What Is a "Lot". - There are several methods which can be used in determining what is a lot in making an appraisal of an area to be annexed. One is to count each numbered lot separately. Another is to consider a landlocked lot as part of the
                            lot in front of it and group the two lots, i.e., the landlocked lot and the one providing it with access to a street, as being a single lot. A third method would be to consider a group of lots in single ownership and used for
                            a single purpose as being a tract within the meaning of the statute, and count tracts rather than lots. Any one of these methods would be "calculated to provide reasonably accurate results," as required by G.S. 160A-42. Adams-Millis
                            Corp. v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 169 S.E.2d 496 (1969).

                        <p>
                            Property owners did not show that a town was unreasonable in relying upon an actual survey, as allowed by G.S. 160A-36; thus, the reviewing court did not err in concluding that one property consisted of two separate lots for the purposes of the subdivision
                            test. Hayes v. Town of Fairmont, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 605 S.E.2d 717 (2004), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 410</cite>, 612 S.E.2d 320 (2005).

                            Landlocked Lot and Fronting Lot as Single Lot. - It is not unreasonable and beyond the statutory definition to classify a landlocked lot and its fronting lot in single ownership as a single lot in residential use, where only the fronting lot contains
                            "a habitable dwelling unit." Adams-Millis Corp. v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 169 S.E.2d 496 (1969).

                            Lots in Single Ownership Used for Common Purpose May Be Considered Single Tract. - In appraising an area to be annexed, one of the methods which can be used to determine what is a tract is to consider several lots in single ownership used for a common
                            purpose as being a single tract; these consolidated lots can then be used to determine the percentage of tracts used for urban purposes. Lowe v. Town of Mebane, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite>                            239, 332 S.E.2d 739 (1985).

                            Tract Held for Future Development Not "Used". - Where about a tenth of a tract of land, marked off by a bumper strip or barrier, was used for parking, and the rest of the tract was graded and held by the owner for possible future industrial development,
                            the vacant part of the tract was not "used " for industrial purposes within the purview of subsection (c). Southern Ry. v. Hook, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 517</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 562 (1964).

                            Classification of apartment complex as commercial rather than residential property was a reasonable method of complying with statutorily mandated requirements for the character of an area to be annexed; the general statutory intent is not to exclude areas
                            of urbanized land from annexation on a technicality, but to provide municipalities with a flexible planning tool. Lowe v. Town of Mebane, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 332 S.E.2d

                            Annexation Ordinance Statement Held Insufficient for Lack of Specific Findings. - A statement in an annexation ordinance that the area to be annexed was in the process of being developed for urban purposes, that more than 60 percent of the area was in
                            use for residential, commercial, industrial, governmental or institutional purposes, and that at least 60 percent of the total acreage, not counting the acreage so used, consisted of lots and tracts of five acres or less in
                            size, did not meet the requirements of this section, as the statement was a mere conclusion and there were no specific findings nor any showing on the face of the record as to the method used by the municipality in making its
                            calculations or as to the present use of any particular tract. Huntley v. Potter, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 681 (1961).

                            Review as to Availability of Area. - If a municipality clearly complies with the standards of subsection (c) of this section, there is nothing to review with respect to the availability of an area proposed for annexation. Where compliance is in doubt,
                            the determination must be made upon the facts in the particular case. Lithium Corp. of Am. v. Town of Bessemer City, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 532</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 574 (1964).

                            Substantial Compliance with Statute Shown. - Trial court erred in concluding that the usage of disputed acres affected the classification of a golf course tract as a whole when the golf course was annexed by a town ordinance, because the golf course tract
                            was properly designated as commercial by the town in its original calculations, and the entire acreage should have been included as commercial acreage for purposes of calculations under the use test; based on the new calculations,
                            the annexation area met the 60 percent minimum required under the subdivision test of G.S. 160A-36(c)(1), and, given that the town substantially complied with the provisions of G.S. 160A-36, the ordinance was properly affirmed
                            without amendment pursuant to G.S. 160A-38. Hayes v. Town of Fairmont, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 605 S.E.2d 717 (2004), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 410</cite>,

                            Village essentially complied with the requirements of G.S. 160A-36 because (1) the village's use and reliance on the then-existing recorded deed and plat, both of which were consistent with the actual description of a one-acre tract of property, complied
                            with the mandates of G.S. 160A-36(d); (2) the recorded line that the village used from a voluntarily-annexed tract was already part of the pre-existing municipal boundary; as such, the line did not constitute a new municipal
                            boundary within the meaning of the statute; (3) the village correctly classified the a tract of land for purposes of G.S. 160A-36(c)(1)'s subdivision test; (4) the village used methods calculated to provide reasonably accurate
                            results to determine the degree of land subdivision; and (5) the village met the literal contiguity requirements in annexing an area. Norwood v.

                            When a town proposed to annex certain land, it did not comply with the subdivision test in G.S. 160A-36(c)(1), requiring that at least 60 percent of a proposed annexation site, not counting acreage used at the time of annexation for commercial, industrial,
                            governmental, or industrial purposes, consist of lots and tracts three acres or less in size, because it designated certain acreage in the proposed annexation area as commercial, when, in fact, the commercial use of the acreage
                            was only proposed, so the acreage was not being used at the time of the annexation for commercial purposes. Hughes v. Town of Oak Island, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 175, 580 S.E.2d

                            that water and, particularly, sewer services are necessarily limited by natural drainage boundaries, the Municipal Government Study Commission, whose recommendations were followed in establishing the present annexation procedures,
                            included topography as an important consideration to be incorporated into the new statutory scheme of annexation. In order to ensure consideration of such topographic features, subsection (d) was enacted specifically enumerating
                            certain features which create natural drainage boundaries. Greene v. Town of Valdese, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 79</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 630 (1982).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subsection (d) contains no mandatory standards or requirements for annexation. Greene v. Town of Valdese, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 79</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 630 (1982).

                            Requirements of Subsection (d) Not Intended to Defeat Otherwise Proper Annexation. - It was not the intent of the legislature to defeat the annexation of an area which was otherwise ripe for annexation because of the directory language contained in subsection
                            (d) of this section. Greene v. Town of Valdese, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 79</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 630 (1982).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Practical" as used in subsection (d) is defined as "that which is possible of reasonable performance." Greene v. Town of Valdese, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 79</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 630 (1982).

                        <p>
                            Tree lines do not constitute "natural topographic features" within the meaning of the requirement of subsection (d) of this section. Greene v. Town of Valdese, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 79</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 630 (1982).

                            No provision in subsection (d) prevents a municipality from using a street as a reference in setting the boundary lines of an area to be annexed. Rexham Corp. v. Town of Pineville, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite>                            349, 216 S.E.2d 445 (1975).

                            Drawing boundary exactly five feet from and parallel to a street for its entire length did not violate subsection (d). Lowe v. Town of Mebane, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 332 S.E.2d 739 (1985).

                            Splitting of Tracts Not Prohibited. - The statutory requirement contained in subsection (d) that a municipality use natural topographic features wherever practical in setting an annexation boundary does not demonstrate a legislative intent to prevent
                            the splitting of tracts. Rexham Corp. v. Town of Pineville, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 349, 216 S.E.2d 445 (1975).

                            Proof of Noncompliance with Subsection (d). - In order to establish noncompliance with subsection (d) of this section, petitioners must show two things: (1) that the boundary of the annexed area does not follow natural topographic features, and (2) that
                            it would have been practical for the boundary to follow such features. Greene v. Town of Valdese, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 79</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 630 (1982); Lowe v. Town of Mebane, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite>                            239, 332 S.E.2d 739 (1985); Weeks v. Town of Coats, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C.

                            Topographic Features Not Followed. - There was sufficient evidence to support the court's conclusion that the town did not attempt to follow topographic features in violation of G.S. 160A-36(d). Weeks v. Town of Coats,

                            Character of areas which may properly be annexed (i) cannot be included within the boundary of another incorporated municipality, (ii) must be adjacent to the existing boundaries of the annexing municipality, (iii) must be developed for urban purposes
                            or must connect an outlying area developed for urban purposes with the municipality and (iv) wherever practical should use topographic features as boundaries. Matheson v. City of Asheville,

                            When a city proposed the annexation of a certain area, it could combine lots in single ownership used for a common purpose into a single tract, which could then be used to determine the percentage of tracts in the area used for urban purposes, under G.S.
                            160A-48(c)(3), but it was impermissible for the city to combine lots being developed for commercial purposes into a single tract classified as commercial because the lots had to be used for a common purpose, and these lots
                            were in the process of development rather than in commercial use. Ridgefield Props., L.L.C. v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 583 S.E.2d 400 (2003), aff'd,

                            City proposing to annex certain land substantially complied with G.S. 160A-48 because land improperly classified as residential should have been classified as "non-urban," as the land met no qualifications to be classified as urban, making G.S. 160A-48(c)
                            inapplicable, as was also true with certain other undeveloped land, and making the classification of this land under G.S. 160A-48(d) proper, which meant the land did not have to qualify under G.S. 160A-48(c), so the land was
                            correctly excluded from calculations of land qualifying for annexation under G.S. 160A-48(c) and, as a result, the total land qualified for annexation under G.S. 160A-48(c)(3), applying the use/subdivision test. Arnold v. City

                            Tests as to Urban Development to Be Applied to Whole Annexation Area. - Not only must the entire annexation area meet the requirements of subsection (c)(1), but even more importantly, the tests to determine whether an area is developed for urban purposes
                            must be applied to the annexation area as a whole. In re Annexation Ordinance, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 442</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 143 (1974); In re City of Durham Annexation Ordinance No. 5791,

                            Division into Sub-Areas or Study Areas Improper. - The urban area that a city seeks to qualify for annexation under one of the urban purposes tests set forth in subdivisions (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section must be considered as a whole, i.e., as
                            one area, and may not be divided into sub-areas or study areas. In re Annexation Ordinance, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 337</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 661 (1980).

                        <p>
                            Application of population credits. - City acted under a misapprehension of the law, and misapplied the statutory standard in subdivision (c)(1), in deciding that population credits should be applied only in the "study area" in which such credits were
                            accumulated, rather than applied uniformly to the whole area to be annexed. In re Annexation Ordinance, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 442</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 143 (1974).

                            Alternative Standards in Subdivisions (c)(1) and (c)(2). - This section's requirement that the area to be annexed must be developed for urban purposes is satisfied if either the standard of subdivision (c)(1) or the standard of subdivision (c)(2) is met.
                            It is not required that both standards be satisfied. In re Annexation Ordinance 301-X, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 565</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 475 (1981).

                            To perform the computations required by the "subdivision test" under subdivision (c)(2) of this section, two figures are needed: the total acreage and the subdivided acreage. In re Annexation Ordinance 301-X, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 565</cite>,

                            Use of Different Standards Upheld. - The trial court did not err in concluding the town complied with subsection (c) of this section in annexing three noncontiguous sub-areas using different standards for qualifying each of the three sub-areas as urban
                            property. Wallace v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 378 S.E.2d 225 (1989).

                            Applicability of Error Margins of G.S. 160A-54 to Calculations Under Subsection (c). - The five percent error margins allowed in subdivisions (2) and (3) of G.S. 160A-54 apply exclusively to calculations made by the municipality for purposes of establishing
                            compliance with the population and subdivision tests contained within the alternative standards prescribed by subsection (c) of this section. Food Town Stores, Inc. v. City of Salisbury, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 21</cite>,

                            The language of G.S. 160A-54 is free from ambiguity and represents a legislative determination that margins of error should be allowed with respect to the calculations made by a municipality to establish compliance with the population and subdivision
                            tests of subsection (c) of this section, but not with respect to the calculations made to establish compliance with the use test of subsection (c). Food Town Stores, Inc. v. City of Salisbury,

                            last preceding decennial census. In re Ordinance of Annexation No. 1977-4, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 1</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 698 (1978).

                            since in accordance with census practice dating back to 1790, persons enumerated in the 1970 census who lived on military bases as members of the armed forces were counted as residents of the states, counties, and minor civil

                            The purpose of subsection (d) is to permit municipal governing boards to extend corporate limits to include all nearby areas developed for urban purposes and, where necessary, to include areas which at the time of annexation are not yet developed for
                            urban purposes but which constitute necessary land connections between the municipality and areas developed for urban purposes or between two or more areas developed for urban purposes. Wallace v. Town of Chapel Hill,

                            Annexation of Intervening Undeveloped Land under Subsection (d). - Where the area proposed to be annexed by a municipality, when considered as a whole, meets the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the fact that a part of the area
                            is an undeveloped tract which does not comply with the standards set out in the statute does not require that such part be excluded from annexation. In re Annexation Ordinance, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 633</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The language of this section simply means that where a developed tract and an undeveloped tract are included in an area to be annexed, and the developed tract complies with subsection (c), but when the undeveloped tract is added, the area as a whole does
                            not so comply, then the undeveloped tract must be excluded unless it complies with one of the requirements of subsection (d). In re Annexation Ordinance, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 633</cite>,

                            A city properly annexed land which was not developed for urban purposes, under G.S. 160A-48(d)(2), along with its annexation of land which was developed for urban purposes, even though the undeveloped land was not contiguous with the city's pre-annexation
                            boundaries, because at least 60 percent of the land's external boundaries were contiguous with the developed land which was being annexed. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Asheville,

                            Plain language of G.S. 160A-48(d)(2), regarding the annexation of areas not developed for urban used, included all possible combinations which made the following equation work: the amount of border which the non-urban area shared with the municipality
                            combined with the amount of border that the non-urban area shared with an area or areas developed for urban purposes equaled 60 percent of the border of the non-urban area, and one workable combination existed where a non-urban
                            area touched, on at least 60 percent of its external border, only an area or areas developed for urban purposes. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite>                            1, 587 S.E.2d 490 (2003).

                            Compliance with Subsection (d). - In defining areas not developed for urban purposes that nevertheless may be annexed, G.S. 160A-48(d)(2) clearly specifies a combination of two things, in "any" variation or quantities of these two entities: the municipal
                            boundary and the boundary of the urban developed area. To totally exclude one entity from the equation fails to yield a true "combination." Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Asheville,

                            Plain meaning of G.S. 160A-48(d)(2) states that there must be a "combination" of adjacency to a municipality and adjacency to areas developed for urban purposes in order for a city to annex land under

                            devised. Nevertheless, since the court reviewing annexation proceedings is explicitly authorized to receive evidence as to the city's compliance with the various procedures prescribed, as to its annexation plan meeting the

                            Collateral Estoppel Barred Reclassification of Land Previously Classified as "Vacant." - Original trial court decision that divided the landowner's property into commercial and "vacant" portions and the order that only the commercial portion be used on
                            remand to determine compliance with G.S. 160A-48(c)(3) could not be construed as a license to attempt to re-classify the vacant acres. United States Cold Storage v.

                            Actual Minimum Urbanization Is An Essential Requirement of the Annexation Act. - "Sound urban development" does not mean a territory may be annexed whenever some documentation of record supports its assessment as urban; it means a territory may be annexed

                            When a city proposed to annex certain property, including certain lots which were being developed for commercial purposes, it was error to classify those lots as being used for a commercial purpose, for purposes of determining compliance with G.S. 160A-48(c)(3),
                            because the property's actual use at the time of the city's service plan was the relevant consideration, rather than a proposed future use. Ridgefield Props., L.L.C. v.

                            Micro Approach Calculations Meet Urbanization Test. - Town met the urbanization test for annexation, where the town used a "micro approach" whereby it determined the number of dwelling units in each census block within the area to be annexed, then determined
                            the average family size therein, then multiplied the number of dwelling units in each census block by the average family size to calculate the estimated population of each block, and finally added the block numbers together

                            Governmental Use. - Involuntary annexation was improper where there was insufficient evidence of governmental use on four disputed tracts; while the evidence supported a finding of common ownership, there was insufficient evidence that the lots served
                            a common purpose, and the court, therefore, erred in relying on a plan of future development to classify the entire tract as under governmental use. Arquilla v.

                            When a power company asserted that certain parts of its land which a city proposed to annex were not developed for industrial use, and, thus, not subject to annexation, there was sufficient evidence from which the trial court could find each tract was
                            used in support of the company's power plant, as there was testimony that two tracts were a buffer for a cooling pond, and that two other tracts were buffers for ash ponds on the property. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v.

                            In addition to topographic features, the statute explicitly permits the use of streets as boundaries. In order to establish non-compliance with subdivision (e) of this section, petitioners must show two things: (1) that the boundary of the annexed area
                            does not follow topographic features, and (2) that it would have been practical for the boundary to follow such features. Matheson v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite>                            156, 402 S.E.2d 140 (1991).

                            City Not Required to Extend Annexation to Areas in Conflict with Mandatory Statute Provisions. - The city was not required to extend the boundaries of the proposed annexation area to include ridge lines where to do so would have defeated the city's compliance
                            with the other mandatory portions of the annexation statute. Matheson v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 402 S.E.2d 140 (1991).

                            Annexation areas that were at least one-eighth contiguous with the municipal boundary and whose portions were connected by street right-of-way corridors, complied with the requirements of G.S. 160A-48(b). Anthony v. City of Shelby,

                            City's division of an annexation area into sub-areas did not result in the improper annexation of an "island" not contiguous with the city limits as of the date of the original resolution of intent, although the boundaries of the sub-area, if considered
                            in isolation, rather than as a sub-part of the area originally identified and eventually annexed, were not contiguous with the city limits on the date of the initial resolution. U.S. Cold Storage, Inc. v. City of Lumberton,

                            Compliance with Subsection (e). - Sufficient evidence supported a finding that the city substantially complied with this section, where the city's Planning Director testified that the city first examined the area to be annexed for natural topographic
                            features, and in the absence of such features, used a 200 foot setback requirement. Blackwell v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 759, 502 S.E.2d 371, cert. denied,

                            Section 160A-48(c)(3) contained two mandatory tests for determining the availability of an area for annexation: (1) the use test - that not less than 60 percent of the lots and tracts in the area had to be in actual use, other than for agriculture, and
                            (2) the subdivision test - not less than 60 percent of the acreage which was in residential use, if any, and was vacant had to consist of lots and tracts of five (now three) acres or less in size. Carolina Power &amp; Light

                            Purpose of G.S. 160A-48(d) was to permit municipal governing boards to extend corporate limits to include all nearby areas developed for urban purposes and where necessary to include areas which at the time of annexation were not yet developed for urban
                            purposes but which constituted necessary land connections between the municipality and areas developed for urban purposes or between two or more areas developed for urban purposes, and for purposes of this subsection, "necessary
                            land connection" meant an area that did not exceed 25 percent of the total area to be annexed. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 587

                            Judicial Review - Annexation ordinance could be challenged in a trial court on the basis that the provisions of G.S. 160A-48 had not been met, under G.S. 160A-50(f)(3), and judicial review of an annexation ordinance was limited to determining whether
                            the annexation proceedings substantially complied with the requirements of the applicable annexation statute. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite>                            1, 587 S.E.2d 490 (2003).

                            Petitioners challenging a city's annexation ordinances failed to show the city misclassified the lots to be annexed or that the county tax maps it relied on were inaccurate. As petitioners offered no reliable evidence that the city's methodology was inaccurate
                            and not calculated to provide reasonably accurate results, as required by G.S. 106A-54, the ordinances were properly deemed valid. Brown v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. App.</cite>                            497, 626 S.E.2d 747 (2006).

                        This section provides two different procedural methods for beginning the involuntary annexation process under G.S. 160A-33 to 160A-42 and former G.S. 160A-43 and 160A-44. A municipality may either pass a resolution of consideration one year prior to adopting
                        its resolution of intent, or it may immediately adopt the resolution of intent and postpone the effective date of annexation for at least a year after the ordinance is passed. Town of Hazelwood v. Town of Waynesville,

                        The trial court's order affirming a town annexation ordinance had to be vacated where the court applied the material prejudice standard of review to the adequacy of maps contained in the town report as well as to the questions of solid waste collection

                        a "material prejudice" standard, while violations of either G.S. 160A-35 or G.S. 160A-36 are to be viewed in light of compliance or lack thereof and, if necessary, result in appropriate amendment. Sonopress, Inc. v. Town of Weaverville,

                        Court of Appeals was filed and certified in September, 1969, property within the area being annexed was not subject to municipal ad valorem taxes for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1969, since (1) newly annexed territory is
                        subject to municipal taxes levied for the fiscal year following the effective date of annexation, under subsection (f) of this section, and (2) under G.S. 160A-38(i), the appeal postponed the effective date of the ordinance until

                    <p>
                        Fact that the metes and bounds description in a resolution of intent to annex failed to close because one small piece of property owned by a person who did not join the petition for review was not included within the resolution of intent was not fatal
                        to the validity of the annexation ordinance, where the resolution of intent and the published notice of public hearing made full reference to a map, filed in the office of the clerk of the city, and available for public inspection
                        of the area proposed to be annexed, and this map and a map published in the newspaper notice of the public hearing showed all the property proposed to be annexed. Conover v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 506</cite>,

                        Property Owner Not Materially Prejudiced by Illegible Map. - Although the public notice provided by town for public hearing on annexation and printed in newspaper included an illegible map, the property owner was not materially prejudiced, since the public
                        notice adequately described the property at issue; further, the property owner was not materially prejudiced by the denial of its request for a postponement of the public hearing because it had ample notice of the proposed annexation
                        and an opportunity to be heard. Sonopress, Inc. v. Town of Weaverville, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 562 S.E.2d 32, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 751</cite>, 565 S.E.2d

                        Where annexation is completed without being challenged in the manner prescribed by G.S. 160A-38, it becomes an accomplished fact, and the remedies of property owners and citizens within the annexed areas are those provided in subsection (h) of this section.

                        from such date to compel the municipality to follow through on its plans for furnishing essential municipal services to the area annexed in accordance with the plans filed in the proceedings. Safrit v. Costlow,

                        Town Not Required to Provide Service. - Language in annexation ordinances to the effect that since water service then provided to the annexed areas by plaintiff was comparable to that provided by the town, the town would not be required to appropriate
                        funds to extend water and sewer lines to the annexed area was required by subdivision (e)(3) and G.S. 160A-35(3)b to insure that residents of the area to be annexed would have access to comparable water service; in no way did this
                        serve as a promise to be rightfully relied upon that the town would not in the future construct its own water lines within the annexed area or that plaintiff had the exclusive right to furnish water service there. Carolina Water

                        New Public Hearing Not Required - Although town's annexation report failed to fully set forth the town's policies regarding sanitation services, the trial court did not have to order a new public hearing, but could remand the issue to the town to more
                        fully and adequately set forth the town's policy, and the proposed extension of such services into the area of annexation; a municipal governing board has the authority to amend an annexation report to make changes in the plans
                        for serving the area proposed to be annexed without another public hearing as long as the changes meet the statutory requirements and were part of the original notice of public hearing. Sonopress, Inc. v. Town of Weaverville,

                        Informational Meeting. - Land owners failed to demonstrate how they had suffered material injury as a result of a village's failure to answer one question at the informational meeting, the answer to which could have no effect on the validity of the proposed
                        annexation, and the annexation was proper. Nolan v. Village of Marvin, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 615 S.E.2d 898 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Annexation Proper. - Village essentially complied with the requirements of G.S. 160A-37 because, while it would have been impermissible for the village to annex property that it had not included in its original report, it was permitted to omit property
                        described in its original report from the property it ultimately annexed, which was exactly what occurred. Norwood v. Village of Sugar Mt., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 293, 667 S.E.2d 524

                        The respondent city was not required to file a new services plan under this section although the annexation area changed during subsequent revisions to the annexation ordinance, where the only significant change to the services plan was the scope of its

                        Minimum requirements of the annexation statute are that the city provide information which is necessary to allow the public and the courts to determine whether the municipality has committed itself to provide a nondiscriminatory level of service and to
                        allow a reviewing court to determine after the fact whether the municipality has timely provided such services. If such services are not provided, the residents of the annexed area would be entitled to a writ of mandamus requiring
                        the municipality to live up to its commitments. Cockrell v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 479</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 770 (1982).

                        Purpose of subsection (a), requiring resolution stating intent to consider annexation, is to record the town board's decision and to mark the formal beginning of the municipality's actions. This resolution expresses the intent of the governing board and
                        it has little significance to the public. Kritzer v. Town of Southern Pines, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 234 S.E.2d 648 (1977).

                        Reading Report at Public Hearing in Compliance with Subsection (d). - Reading report of proposed annexation in its entirety at a public hearing is a more detailed explanation of the report than a shorter summary explanation prepared by a representative
                        of the municipality would have been. In this manner, those who attend the meeting are made aware of each and every provision and statement in the report and are then given an opportunity to be heard. This is sufficient compliance
                        with the requirements of subsection (d) of this section. In re Annexation Ordinance, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 337</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 661 (1980).

                        mailed and no contention that the property owners did not receive the mailed notices, this irregularity was so slight that it could not have prejudiced petitioner, and it did not require remand of the ordinance. Thrash v. City

                        Public Informational Meeting - City substantially complied with the requirement of G.S. 160A-49(c1) that property owners be given the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers regarding a proposed annexation, when the trial court found all persons
                        attending a public informational meeting were given the opportunity to ask one or more questions to which city representatives responded. Anthony v. City of Shelby, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite>                        144, 567 S.E.2d 222 (2002).

                        of one lot and no change in the subsections of G.S. 160A-48 under which the city sought annexation, there was no substantial change to the ordinance, necessitating notice. Arnold v. City of Asheville,

                        Remand Was Appropriate Remedy for Alleged Notice Irregularity. - Trial court did not err in refusing to declare an involuntary annexation ordinance null and void where, assuming arguendo that any alleged procedural irregularities pursuant to G.S. 160A-49(b)(3)
                        had prejudiced a landowner, the remedy under G.S. 160A-50(g)(1) was a remand to the municipal governing board for further proceedings. United States Cold Storage v. City of Lumberton, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite>                        327, 576 S.E.2d 415 (2003).

                        Extension of sewer lines and other services into the annexed area, pursuant to the plan of annexation, is not a condition precedent to annexation, the statutory remedy for failure to extend such services being an application, by a person owning property
                        in the annexed territory, for a writ of mandamus to compel such performance of the plan. Dale v. City of Morganton, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 567</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 136 (1967).

                        In reviewing the procedure followed by a municipal governing board in an annexation proceeding, the question whether the municipality is then providing services pursuant to the plan of annexation is not before the court, and the extension of services
                        into an annexed area in accordance with the promulgated plan is not a condition precedent to annexation. In re City of New Bern, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 641</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 851 (1971).

                        Persons in Annexed Areas May Be Denied Vote During 60-Day Approval Period. - Although those in annexed areas become citizens of the annexing jurisdiction upon annexation, under 42 U.S.C.

    §

                        Failure of Resolution of Intent to State Effective Date. - City's failure to state effective date of annexation in its resolution of intent was not an omission of an essential requirement of the statute but was only a "slight irregularity," which would
                        not invalidate annexation proceedings if there has been substantial compliance with all essential elements of the law. City of Kannapolis v. City of Concord, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 512</cite>, 391

                        annexations, G.S. 160A-49, superseded a city charter provision permitting only voluntary annexations. Brown v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 266, 614 S.E.2d 599 (2005).

                        sewerage district formed under Article 4 or Article 5 of Chapter 162A of the General Statutes; a county water or sewer district formed under Article 6 of Chapter 162A of the General Statutes; a sanitary district formed under Article
                        2 of Chapter 130A of the General Statutes; a county-owned water or sewer system; a municipal-owned water or sewer system; a water or sewer utility created by an act of the General Assembly; or a joint agency providing a water or

                        <br /> view - The superior court's review of an involuntary annexation proceeding, pursuant to this section, is limited in scope to the following: (1) Did the municipality comply with the statutory procedures? (2) If not, will
                        petitioners "suffer material injury" by reason of the municipality's failure to comply? (3) Does the character of the area specified for annexation meet the requirements of G.S. 160A-36 as applied to petitioners' property? Conover

                        area to be annexed meet the requirements of G.S. 160A-36 or G.S. 160A-48? Huyck Corp. v. Town of Wake Forest, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 356 S.E.2d 599, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 589</cite>,

                        Remedy Under G.S. 160A-37 Exclusive Where Annexation Not Challenged Under This Section. - Where annexation is completed without being challenged in the manner prescribed by this section, it becomes an accomplished fact, and the remedies of property owners
                        and citizens within the annexed areas are those provided in subsection (h) of G.S. 160A-37. Gaskill v. Costlow, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 686</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 148 (1967).

                        of the ordinance seeking a review of the action of the municipal board of commissioners, in accordance with the procedure provided by this section, and an independent action instituted some 22 months after the adoption of the ordinance
                        and seeking to have it declared void ab initio will be dismissed. Gaskill v. Costlow, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 686</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 148 (1967).

                    <p>
                        Fact that city was proceeding under a local act which did not set forth the persons who could appeal, rather than under this Chapter, did not extend the right to challenge the annexation to persons outside the annexed area who did not own property within

                        Failure to Allege Material Injury Not Fatal. - While the better practice would be to allege specifically that the petitioner will suffer material injury by reason of the failure of respondent to comply with the statutory procedures regarding annexation,
                        the failure to do so is not fatal, particularly if the petition contains allegations from which material injury can be implied. Adams-Millis Corp. v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite>                        78, 169 S.E.2d 496, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 681</cite> (1969).

                        Effect of Appeal on Effective Date of Annexation for Tax Purposes. - Where an appeal from an annexation ordinance was pending in the Court of Appeals on the effective date of annexation specified in the ordinance, May 15, 1969, and the decision of the
                        Court of Appeals was filed and certified in September 1969, property within the area being annexed was not subject to municipal ad valorem taxes for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1969, since (1) newly annexed territory is subject
                        to municipal taxes levied for the fiscal year following the effective date of annexation, G.S. 160A-37(f), and (2) under subsection (i) of this section the appeal postponed the effective date of the ordinance until the date of
                        the final judgment of the appellate court. Adams-Millis Corp. v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 147</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 704 (1972).

                        and substantial compliance with this Article as a condition precedent to the right of the municipality to annex the territory. Huntley v. Potter, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 681

                        Burden on Petitioners to Prove Prejudicial Irregularity Where Prima Facie Compliance Shown. - Where, upon review in the superior court of an annexation ordinance, the record of the proceeding shows prima facie that there has been substantial compliance
                        with the requirements and provisions of the annexation statute, the burden is upon petitioners to show by competent evidence failure on the part of the municipality to comply with the statutory requirements as a matter of fact,
                        or irregularity in the proceedings which materially prejudices the substantive rights of petitioners. Huntley v. Potter, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 681 (1961); In re Annexation

                        Trial court erred in striking down a village's annexation ordinances because the village substantially complied with the essential statutory provisions in annexing the property owners' land and the property owners failed to produce competent evidence
                        demonstrating that the village failed to meet the statutory requirements as a matter of fact or that an irregularity in the proceedings existed which materially prejudiced the owners' substantive rights so that the owners suffered
                        a material injury. Norwood v. Village of Sugar Mt., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 293, 667 S.E.2d 524 (2008), review denied, review dismissed, as moot, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 582</cite>,

                        Nothing to Review on Issue of Availability If Compliance Is Clear. - If a municipality clearly complies with the standards of subsection (c) of G.S. 160A-36, there is nothing to review with respect to the availability of an area proposed for annexation.

                        Remand Where Compliance Not Shown by Record. - Under this section, if the record of annexation proceedings on its face fails to show substantial compliance with any essential provision of this Article, the superior court upon review must remand to the
                        governing board for amendment with respect to such noncompliance. Huntley v. Potter, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 681 (1961).

                        Remand of Ordinance for Amendment. - Trial court, pursuant to G.S. 160A-38(g)(2), instead of striking a village ordinance should have simply remanded the ordinance to the village to amend the annexation boundaries so as to conform with G.S. 160A-36. Norwood

                        Public Hearing on Remand. - Neither subdivision (g)(2) of this section nor any other provisions of the annexation statute requires the municipal governing board upon remand to hold a second public hearing unless it adds an area not included in the original
                        notice of public hearing and not provided for in the plans for service. Rexham Corp. v. Town of Pineville, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 349, 216 S.E.2d 445 (1975).

                        When Court May Permit Annexation of Part of Area. - The superior court may permit, under subsection (h) of this section, an annexation ordinance to be effective with respect to a part of the area proposed only when there is no appeal in regard to such
                        part and the municipality agrees to the order for such partial annexation. Huntley v. Potter, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 681 (1961).

                        Where an order is issued restraining the operation of an annexation ordinance as to the entire area pending review, subsection (e) of this section has no application, since the statute permits the court to approve the annexation of a part of the proposed
                        area only when no question for review has been raised as to such part. Huntley v. Potter, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 619</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 681 (1961).

                    <p>
                        Voiding of Town Ordinance Rather Than Remanding - When a town adopted an ordinance proposing to annex certain land, it was proper for the trial court to declare the ordinance void, under G.S. 160A-38(g)(4), rather than remanding the matter to the town
                        for amendment of the boundaries, because there was no evidence that the annexation area could be corrected on remand to comply with the applicable statutes. Hughes v.

                        Jurisdiction of Court of Appeals. - An appeal from an order of the superior court affirming an annexation ordinance was properly taken to the Court of Appeals, notwithstanding that by clear legislative oversight subsections (h) and (i) of this section
                        were not amended to include the Court of Appeals as one of the appellate courts, since <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIa05s7A-27" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-27</a></cite> gives
                        initial appellate jurisdiction of such cause to the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals, therefore, is deemed to be included in subsections (h) and (i). Adams-Millis Corp. v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 147</cite>,

                        Filing of Petition Necessary to Perfect Appellate Jurisdiction in Superior Court. - An appeal from the passage of an annexation ordinance by a municipality having a population of less than 5,000 must be taken within 30 days following such passage by filing
                        a petition in the superior court of the county in which the municipality is located. Compliance with this provision is a condition precedent to perfecting appellate jurisdiction in the superior court for the review of an annexation
                        ordinance. Ingles Markets, Inc. v. Town of Black Mt., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 390 S.E.2d 688, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 429</cite>, 395 S.E.2d 679 (1990).

                        Entry of Remand Order Divested Superior Court of Jurisdiction. - Superior court's entry of order of remand of appeal of adoption of 1988 ordinance for the limited purpose of including specific findings of fact that the area to be annexed was developed
                        for urban purposes divested that court of appellate jurisdiction to conduct further review of those aspects of the petition brought forward, but not addressed by the order, such that petitioner was required to appeal anew from
                        the action of the town taken pursuant to remand in adopting an amended 1989 ordinance in order to obtain the right to a review of the 1989 ordinance in the superior court. Ingles Markets, Inc. v. Town of Black Mt.,

                        Further Appellate Review After Remand. - In order to obtain further review of an annexation ordinance after infirmities have been corrected by the municipality pursuant to an order of remand, whether such order of remand addresses all or merely some of
                        the issues raised in the initial petition, appellate jurisdiction in the superior court must be perfected anew by filing a separate petition in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 160A-38(a). Ingles Markets, Inc. v. Town of

                        Property owners did not show that a town was unreasonable in relying upon an actual survey, as allowed by G.S. 160A-36; thus, the reviewing court did not err in concluding that one property consisted of two separate lots for the purposes of the subdivision

                        Substantial Compliance With Statute Shown. - Trial court erred in concluding that the usage of disputed acres affected the classification of a golf course tract as a whole when the golf course was annexed by a town ordinance, because the golf course tract
                        was properly designated as commercial by the town in its original calculations, and the entire acreage should have been included as commercial acreage for purposes of calculations under the use test; based on the new calculations,
                        the annexation area met the 60 percent minimum required under the subdivision test of G.S. 160A-36(c)(1), and, given that the town substantially complied with the provisions of G.S. 160A-36, the ordinance was properly affirmed
                        without amendment pursuant to G.S. 160A-38. Hayes v. Town of Fairmont, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 605 S.E.2d 717 (2004), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 410</cite>, 612

                        Annexation Properly Affirmed. - Trial court properly found that a village provided independent administrative, engineering, auditing, legal, and planning services to its residents, and that the village was exploring options for obtaining additional police
                        patrol services, and had committed itself to providing its current and future levels of such services to its residents in a non-discriminatory manner; the trial court found that the village was going to provide some additional
                        services to the area to be annexed, notwithstanding land owners' claim they would receive no additional services whatsoever, and the trial court's order affirming the annexation was proper. Nolan v. Village of Marvin,

                            The central purpose behind the annexation procedure is to assure that, in return for the added financial burden of municipal taxation, the residents of the annexed area receive the benefits of all the major services available to municipal residents. In

                            Subsection (g) Time Requirement. - A city annexation ordinance was valid where the city complied with the 3-month requirement of subsection (g) although it acted more than six months after the Court of Appeals' opinion was filed; the city could act only
                            after the case was remanded two times; first to the superior court, and then to the city council because only then did the city have the power to revise the annexation ordinance. Bowers v. City of Thomasville,

                            Denial of Motion to Intervene Was Proper. - Denial of a corporation's motion to intervene in a case seeking review of an annexation ordinance was proper, since the corporation failed to comply with G.S. 160A-50 procedures by moving to intervene six months
                            after the ordinance was adopted; intervention was also improper under G.S. 1A-1-24, due to the facts that the motion was filed after judgment approving a settlement was entered and that the proposed intervention would have
                            prejudiced the original parties by destroying their settlement. Gates Four Homeowners Ass'n v. City of Fayetteville, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 688, 613 S.E.2d 55 (2005).

                            Order compelling discovery was generally not immediately appealable; while G.S. 160A-50 contemplated an expedited hearing procedure, where the challengers in an annexation case did not appear concerned with an expedited hearing, and the most significant
                            portion of the delay in the matter was due to the challengers' refusal to answer discovery, and in getting the matter before the appellate court, the challengers failed to show that a substantial right was affected, and an

                            Absolute and literal compliance with a statute describing the conditions of annexation is unnecessary; substantial compliance only is required, because absolute and literal compliance with the statute would result in defeating the purpose of the statute

                            Adverse Effect upon Financial Interests Not Grounds for Attacking Annexation Proceedings. - A property owner can attack annexation proceedings only upon the grounds specified in the statutes; he cannot successfully resist annexation because a city ordinance
                            will adversely affect his financial interest. In re City of New Bern, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 641</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 851 (1971); Cockrell v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 479</cite>,

                            Remand for Amendment of Record. - If the record of annexation proceedings on its face fails to show substantial compliance with any essential provision of the statute, the superior court upon review must remand to the governing board for amendment with
                            respect to such noncompliance. The court itself is without authority to amend the report, ordinance or other part of the record, even if evidence is presented which justifies amendment. Huntley v. Potter,

                            to the petitioners, where the end result was that petitioners were not made part of the city by the ordinance at issue. Southern Glove Mfg. Co. v. City of Newton, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite>                            754, 306 S.E.2d 466 (1983).

                            was a remand to the municipal governing board for further proceedings. United States Cold Storage v. City of Lumberton, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 576 S.E.2d 415 (2003).

                            Applicability of Rules of Civil Procedure. - Since judicial review of an annexation ordinance is manifestly a "proceeding of a civil nature," the Rules of Civil Procedure clearly apply to it, unless a different procedure is provided by statute, but only
                            to the extent necessary to process the proceeding according to its nature. A different procedure for this proceeding from that provided in the Rules of Civil Procedure is provided to some extent by this section. Campbell v.

                            Appellants' motion to intervene in another party's petition for review of an annexation ordinance was properly denied because, even assuming G.S. 1A-1-24(a) applied to appeals of annexation ordinances under G.S. 160A-50(a), judgment had already entered,
                            intervention would have prejudiced the city and the other party, and appellants did not offer a legitimate reason for the delay. Home Builders Ass'n of Fayetteville N.C. Inc. v. City of Fayetteville,

                            Discovery. - Judicial review of an annexation ordinance is a limited judicial review, with few similarities to ordinary civil actions which are initiated, tried and adjudicated in a different manner and for which the Rules of Civil Procedure were mostly
                            devised. Nevertheless, since the court reviewing annexation proceedings is explicitly authorized to receive evidence as to the city's compliance with the various procedures prescribed, as to its annexation plan meeting the
                            requisites of G.S. 160A-47, and as to the area involved being eligible for annexation under G.S. 160A-48, in those instances where discovery may illuminate these issues that it is authorized under the Rules of Civil Procedure.

                        <p>
                            Power to Require Production of Evidence. - Absent an explicit statutory restriction to the contrary, a judge having the duty to receive evidence on and decide certain issues has the power, within his discretion, to require that evidence on those issues
                            be produced. In the exercise of that power other factors require consideration, however, including the information already available through the documents required by subsection (c) of this section and the mandate contained
                            in this section that these reviews be accomplished expeditiously and without unnecessary delays. Campbell v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 319 S.E.2d 323, cert.

                            Settlement of Annexation Disputes. - Settlements of annexation disputes under G.S. 160A-50(m) are not "actions having the effect of an ordinance" under G.S. 160A-75, but are a method of dispute resolution in the annexation process; therefore, there is
                            no need to send the matter back to city council after a settlement is reached. Home Builders Ass'n of Fayetteville N.C. Inc. v. City of Fayetteville, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 625,

                            Sufficiency of Annexation Report. - City's annexation report was appropriate to the extent which (1) it contained a statement setting forth the plans of the city for the extension of street maintenance services to the annexation area in compliance with
                            G.S. 160A-47(3)(a); (2) it complied with G.S. 160A-47 regarding the sewer service installation fee; (3) it provided a sufficient statement in an annexation report showing the financial impact of the annexation as required by

                            18, 1980, remanded the annexation plan report to the town board for a more specific statement of the services to be provided and the sources of revenues to finance such services, and where the infirmities in the report were
                            cured by a revised plan adopted on February 26, 1980, this date became the effective date of the annexation ordinance, subject to further appeal to the superior court. Where such appeal was taken and the superior court entered
                            an order on March 4, 1980, approving the revised annexation plan report and affirming the annexation, the effective date of the annexation became March 4, 1980, subject to further appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court
                            (now to the Court of Appeals). When petitioner appealed from that judgment to the Supreme Court, the effective date of the ordinance was again postponed by the language of subsection (i) of this section, until the date the

                        Determining What Is a "Lot". - In making an appraisal of an area to be annexed, there are several methods which can be used in determining what is a lot. One is to count each numbered lot separately. Another is to consider a landlocked lot as part of
                        the lot in front of it and group the two lots, i.e., the landlocked lot and the one providing it with access to a street, as being a single lot. A third method would be to consider a group of lots in single ownership and used for
                        a single purpose as being a tract within the meaning of the statute, and count tracts rather than lots. Any one of these methods would be "calculated to provide reasonably accurate results," as required by this section. Adams-Millis

                        Property owners did not show that a town was unreasonable in relying upon an actual survey, as allowed by G.S. 160A-36; thus, the reviewing court did not err in concluding that one property consisted of two separate lots for the purposes of the subdivision
                        test. Hayes v. Town of Fairmont, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 605 S.E.2d 717 (2004), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 410</cite>, 612 S.E.2d 320 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Recorded Plat. - Recorded plat was not a "reasonably reliable" source for purposes of showing subdivision where: (1) property shown on plat had never actually been developed; (2) county tax office had exceeded its statutory authority in classifying property
                        as "subdivision," because it was not divided into lots and there were no streets (G.S. 105-287); (3) the property had never been surveyed; and (4) no lots had ever been sold. Further, aerial photographs showed no road while recorded
                        plat did. When accuracy of record evidence proffered by city to meet requisites for annexation is belied by evidence of actual condition of property, such records are not "reasonably reliable" for the purposes of this section.

                        the average family size therein, then multiplied the number of dwelling units in each census block by the average family size to calculate the estimated population of each block, and finally added the block numbers together to
                        produce the population estimate. Williams v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 500 S.E.2d 770, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 241</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 611

                        provide reasonably accurate results, as required by G.S. 160A-54, because they presented no expert testimony about the spreadsheets, and testimony of the city's principal planner was insufficient to establish a foundation for their
                        admissibility. Brown v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 626 S.E.2d 747 (2006).

                        Applicability of Error Margins to Calculations Under

                        <span class="s2">

     §
    
</span> 160A-48(c). - The five percent error margins allowed in subdivisions (2) and (3) of this section apply exclusively to calculations made by the municipality for purposes of establishing compliance with the population and
                        subdivision tests contained within the alternative standards prescribed by G.S. 160A-48(c). Food Town Stores, Inc. v. City of Salisbury, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 21</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 123 (1980).

                    <p>
                        The language of this section is free from ambiguity and represents a legislative determination that margins of error should be allowed with respect to the calculations made by a municipality to establish compliance with the population and subdivision
                        tests of G.S. 160A-48(c), but not with respect to the calculations made to establish compliance with the use test of G.S. 160A-48(c). Food Town Stores, Inc. v. City of Salisbury, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 21</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Method of Calculating Number of Lots. - A municipality is not tied to any particular method of calculating the number of lots so long as the method utilized is calculated to provide reasonably accurate results. Food Town Stores, Inc. v. City of Salisbury,
                        <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 21</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 123 (1980).

                    <p>
                        The fact that different methods of lot calculation have been used by the city in past annexations is of no import where the record establishes that the method utilized in the annexation under scrutiny complies with the requirements of this section. Food
                        Town Stores, Inc. v. City of Salisbury, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 21</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 123 (1980).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is eminently reasonable for the city to follow actual use and ownership patterns instead of artificial patterns of subdivision in determining the number of lots in the area to be annexed. Such method of lot counting was calculated to provide reasonably
                        accurate results as required by this section. Food Town Stores, Inc. v. City of Salisbury, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 21</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 123 (1980).

                        Petitioners Failed to Meet Burden to Show Inaccuracy of City's Methodology. - Petitioners challenging a city's annexation ordinances failed to show the city misclassified the lots to be annexed or that the county tax maps it relied on were inaccurate.
                        As they offered no reliable evidence that the city's methodology was inaccurate and not calculated to provide reasonably accurate results, as required by G.S. 106A-54, the ordinances were properly deemed valid. Brown v. City of

                        Vacating Office for Preexisting Impediment. - While there can be no serious doubt of the right of a corporate body to vacate the seat of a corporate officer for adequate causes arising subsequent to taking his seat, there has been no precedent for depriving
                        a member of his place by the action of a municipal body of which he is a member for any preexisting impediment affecting his capacity to hold the office. Ellison v. Aldermen of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 125</cite>                        (1883).

                    A vacancy that occurs in an elective office of a city shall be filled by appointment of the city council. If the term of the office expires immediately following the next regular city election, or if the next regular city election will be held within
                    90 days after the vacancy occurs, the person appointed to fill the vacancy shall serve the remainder of the unexpired term. Otherwise, a successor shall be elected at the next regularly scheduled city election that is held more than
                    90 days after the vacancy occurs, and the person appointed to fill the vacancy shall serve only until the elected successor takes office. The elected successor shall then serve the remainder of the unexpired term. If the number of
                    vacancies on the council is such that a quorum of the council cannot be obtained, the mayor shall appoint enough members to make up a quorum, and the council shall then proceed to fill the remaining vacancies. If the number of vacancies
                    on the council is such that a quorum of the council cannot be obtained and the office of mayor is vacant, the Governor may fill the vacancies upon the request of any remaining member of the council, or upon the petition of any five
                    registered voters of the city. Vacancies in appointive offices shall be filled by the same authority that makes the initial appointment. This section shall not apply to vacancies in cities that have not held a city election, levied
                    any taxes, or engaged in any municipal functions for a period of five years or more.

                    party.

                <p>
                    By following the procedure set out in this section, the council may amend the city charter by ordinance to implement any of the optional forms set out in G.S. 160A-101. The council shall first adopt a resolution of intent to consider an ordinance amending
                    the charter. The resolution of intent shall describe the proposed charter amendments briefly but completely and with reference to the pertinent provisions of G.S. 160A-101, but it need not contain the precise text of the charter amendments
                    necessary to implement the proposed changes. At the same time that a resolution of intent is adopted, the council shall also call a public hearing on the proposed charter amendments, the date of the hearing to be not more than 45 days
                    after adoption of the resolution. A notice of the hearing shall be published at least once not less than 10 days prior to the date fixed for the public hearing, and shall contain a summary of the proposed amendments. Following the
                    public hearing, but not earlier than the next regular meeting of the council and not later than 60 days from the date of the hearing, the council may adopt an ordinance amending the charter to implement the amendments proposed in the
                    resolution of intent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The council may, but shall not be required to unless a referendum petition is received pursuant to G.S. 160A-103, make any ordinance adopted pursuant to this section effective only if approved by a vote of the people, and may by resolution adopted at
                    the same time call a special election for the purpose of submitting the ordinance to a vote. The date fixed for the special election shall be the next date permitted under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a23s163-287ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 163-287(a)</a></cite>                    that is more than 70 days after adoption of the ordinance.

                <p>
                    Within 10 days after an ordinance is adopted under this section, the council shall publish a notice stating that an ordinance amending the charter has been adopted and summarizing its contents and effect. If the ordinance is made effective subject to
                    a vote of the people, the council shall publish a notice of the election in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a23s163-287" target="_blank">G.S. 163-287</a></cite>, and need

                <p>
                    The people may initiate a referendum on proposed charter amendments. An initiative petition shall bear the signatures and resident addresses of a number of qualified voters of the city equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the whole number of voters
                    who are registered to vote in city elections according to the most recent figures certified by the State Board of Elections or 5,000, whichever is less. The petition shall set forth the proposed amendments by describing them briefly
                    but completely and with reference to the pertinent provisions of G.S. 160A-101, but it need not contain the precise text of the charter amendments necessary to implement the proposed changes. The petition may not propose changes in
                    the alternative, or more than one integrated set of charter amendments. Upon receipt of a valid initiative petition, the council shall call a special election on the question of adopting the charter amendments proposed therein, and
                    shall give public notice thereof in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a23s163-287" target="_blank">G.S. 163-287</a></cite>. The date of the special election shall be fixed
                    on a date permitted by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a23s163-287" target="_blank">G.S. 163-287</a></cite>. If a majority of the votes cast in the special election shall be in favor of the proposed changes,
                    the council shall adopt an ordinance amending the charter to put them into effect. Such an ordinance shall not be subject to a referendum petition. No initiative petition may be filed (i) between the time the council initiates proceedings
                    under G.S. 160A-102 by publishing a notice of hearing on proposed charter amendments and the time proceeding under that section have been carried to a conclusion either through adoption or rejection of a proposed ordinance or lapse
                    of time, nor (ii) within one year and six months following the effective date of an ordinance amending the city charter pursuant to this Article, nor (iii) within one year and six months following the date of any election on charter
                    amendments that were defeated by the voters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The restrictions imposed by this section on filing initiative petitions shall apply only to petitions concerning the same subject matter. For example, pendency of council action on amendments concerning the method of electing the council shall not preclude
                    an initiative petition on adoption of the council-manager form of government.

                        Policy as to Payment of Employees Must Have Council Approval. - This section makes ineffective any policy as to payment of city employees in the City of Wilmington, a city with the council-manager form of government, without the approval of the Wilmington

                        As the evidence before the trial court on a motion for summary judgment filed by a police department did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether numerous current police officers were entitled to a pay increase, because the city council
                        had not approved any pay raise for existing employees of the police department with post-secondary degrees, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the department and against the contesting officers. City

                        fell within the purview of this section and its mandate as to "schedule of pay." Newber v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 350 S.E.2d 125 (1986), cert. denied and appeal

                        Compensation When No Salary Specified. - Where a municipal corporation engaged a commissioner of its sinking fund under the provisions of its charter, by which the incumbent was employed for a term of years continuously, his employment was that of a public
                        officer, which precluded compensation based upon a quantum meruit, and he could not recover for his services in the absence of express statutory provision. Borden v. City of Goldsboro, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 661</cite>,

                        outside the scope of his office, due to his clear violation of the conflict of interest statute, G.S 14-234(a), so that he was not entitled to have his defense provided by the county, and, while the actions of the other commissioners
                        did not rise to a violation of the conflict of interest law, their actions combined with their judgment and knowledge of the actions of the commissioner who was guilty of a conflict of interest raised questions as to whether their
                        conduct was within the course and scope of their office. Gibbs v. Mayo, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 549, 591 S.E.2d 905, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 543</cite>, 599 S.E.2d

                        Complaint Alleging Waiver of Governmental Immunity. - Dismissal of the complaint seeking reimbursement for costs incurred in defending lawsuits brought against the former chief of police during his tenure was not warranted because the former chief sufficiently
                        pled waiver of governmental immunity by alleging the essence of a contract claim: that he had an employment relationship with the city that included an obligation on the part of the city to pay for his defense and that the city
                        failed to do so. Wray v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 41</cite>, 802 S.E.2d 894 (2017).

                    It is not the purpose of this section to allow infringement upon the rights of employees to engage in free speech and free association. Every city employee has a civic responsibility to support good government by every available means and in every appropriate
                    manner. Employees shall not be restricted from affiliating with civic organizations of a partisan or political nature, nor shall employees, while off duty, be restricted from attending political meetings, or advocating and supporting
                    the principles or policies of civic or political organizations, or supporting partisan or nonpartisan candidates of their choice in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the State and the Constitution and laws of the United

                            The necessary implication of subdivision (b)(3) is that the General Assembly intended to allow the issuance of a preliminary injunction upon a showing by plaintiffs of a likelihood of success on the merits of a tort claim and some type of irreparable
                            harm, even where an ordinance has not been enforced by local authorities or where an ordinance might permit one to pursue a course of action that otherwise would constitute a potential tort claim under State law. Kaplan v.

                            cert. denied, 283 S.E.2d 131 (1980).

                            A municipal ordinance promulgated in the exercise of the police power will not be declared unconstitutional unless it is clearly so, and every intendment will be made to sustain it. Currituck County v. Willey, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite>                            835, 266 S.E.2d 52, cert. denied, 283 S.E.2d 131 (1980).

                            Doubt as to whether an ordinance is invalid, as conflicting with individual rights, should be resolved against the city. Slaughter v. O'Berry, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 181</cite>, 35 S.E. 241, 48 L.R.A. 442 (1900).

                        <p>
                            The courts will not inquire into the motives which prompt a municipality's legislative body to enact an ordinance which is valid on its face. Clark's Greenville, Inc. v. West, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 527</cite>, 151
                            S.E.2d 5 (1966).

                        <p>
                            Courts Will Be Slow to Interfere. - By this section discretionary power is vested in the city authorities, and the courts will be slow to interfere when the ordinance is not contrary to the laws of the State and no fraud, dishonesty, or oppression is
                            charged. State v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 855</cite>, 19 S.E. 919 (1894).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unless municipality's action is so clearly unreasonable as to amount to oppression and manifest abuse of discretion, courts will be slow to interfere, and then the power of the court will be exercised with great caution and only in a clear case. Jones
                            v. Town of N. Wilkesboro, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 646</cite>, 64 S.E. 866 (1909).

                        <p>
                            Scope of Courts' Review. - Where town passed ordinance pursuant to its police power as provided under G.S. 160A-186 and expressly stated that its purpose was to protect the health, safety and welfare of the town, review of validity of such ordinance would
                            be to determine if the police power had been exercised within the constitutional limitations imposed by both the state and federal Constitutions. Such review would not include an analysis of the motives which prompted the passage
                            of the ordinance, because so long as an act is not forbidden, the wisdom of the enactment is exclusively a legislative decision. Town of Atlantic Beach v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 422</cite>,
                            298 S.E.2d 686, appeal dismissed, 462 U.S. 1101, 103 S. Ct. 2446, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1328 (1983).

                            Challenge to Constitutionality of Criminal Statute or Ordinance in Action to Enjoin Enforcement. - Notwithstanding the general rule that the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance purporting to create a criminal offense may not be challenged in an
                            action to enjoin its enforcement, a well-established exception permits such action when injunctive relief is essential to the protection of property rights and the rights of persons against injuries otherwise irremediable.

                            General Laws Prevail over Ordinances. - Municipal bylaws and ordinances must be in harmony with the general laws of the State, and whenever they come in conflict with the general laws, the bylaws and ordinances must give way. Washington v. Hammond,
                            <cite

                            Legislative Classifications to Bear Reasonable Relation to Purpose. - So long as classification made by ordinance bears some reasonable relationship to the public welfare which the ordinance seeks to promote, the ordinance will not be rendered unconstitutional
                            merely because persons in one class derive some incidental competitive advantage over those in another. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 289,
                            172 S.E.2d 276, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).

                        <p>
                            The equal protection clauses of the United States and North Carolina Constitutions impose upon law-making bodies the requirement that any legislative classification be based on differences that are reasonably related to the purposes of the act in which

                            No Liability for Failure to Enact or Enforce Ordinances. - A municipal corporation is not civilly liable for failure to pass ordinances to preserve the public health or otherwise promote the public good, nor for any omission to enforce the ordinances
                            enacted under the legislative powers granted in its charter or to see that they are properly observed by its citizens or by those who may be resident within the corporate limits. Bunch v. Edenton,

                            When Owner Is Entitled to Compensation for Abatement of Nuisance. - An owner of property is not entitled to compensation for property rightfully destroyed or damaged by a city in abating a nuisance; the reason for this is that the destruction or damage
                            is for public safety or health and is not a taking of private property for public use without compensation or due process in the constitutional sense. Rhyne v. Town of Mount Holly, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 521</cite>,

                            declared to be a nuisance. Rhyne v. Town of Mount Holly, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 521</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 40 (1960).

                            Conflict Between Regulation Adopted by State Agency and Municipal Ordinance - Provision of the Gastonia (North Carolina) City Code that governed outdoor billboards conflicted with a regulation that was adopted by the North Carolina Department of Transportation
                            (DOT) to implement North Carolina's Outdoor Advertising Control Act, G.S. 136-126 et seq., and was preempted by the DOT's regulation. Morris Communs. Corp. v.

                            of ocean front property owners, the appellate court could find nothing in the State Lands Act, codified at <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.146.html#t146s0Ia01s146-1" target="_blank">G.S. 146-1</a></cite>                            et seq., which limited the authority of a town or city to enact regulations in order to protect a public beach located within its municipal limits.

                            Sunday observance ordinances, when they proscribe buying and selling, whether it be tangible merchandise or a ticket to an amusement or a sporting event, regulate trade under the broad definition of trade which has been adopted by the Supreme Court. Since,
                            however, these city ordinances are passed under general laws, with reference to them there is no conflict between the exercise of the police power and N.C. Const., Art. II,

                            The provisions of N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s2">

                            except for works of necessity and acts which, themselves, are in exercise of the constitutional right to worship. The legislature may delegate this power to municipalities. Such legislation is within the police power of the
                            State and, nothing else appearing, is not a violation of U.S. Const., Amends. I and XIV. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).

                            Enactment of Sunday regulations comes within the police power, and the General Assembly or a municipal governing board exercising delegated power may enact such regulations provided the classifications of those affected are based upon reasonable distinctions,
                            affect all persons similarly situated, and have some reasonable relation to the public peace, welfare, and safety. Clark's Charlotte, Inc. v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 222</cite>, 134

                            Reasonable and Nondiscriminatory Ordinances Upheld. - When enacted by cities and towns under general laws, Sunday observance ordinances which are reasonable and do not discriminate within a class of competitors similarly situated have been upheld as a
                            valid exercise of delegated police power. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).

                            Validity of Ordinance Dependent on Reasonable Relation to Legitimate Objective. - The validity of a Sunday closing statute or ordinance depends upon its reasonable relation to the accomplishment of the State's legitimate objective, which, in this instance,
                            is the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and welfare by the establishment of a day of rest and relaxation. Legislation for this purpose, like other legislation, may not discriminate arbitrarily either between persons,
                            or groups of persons, or between activities which are prohibited and those which are permitted. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 8 (1972).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The general rule is that the enactment of Sunday regulations is a legitimate exercise of the police power, and that the classification on which a Sunday law is based is within the discretion of the legislative branch of the government or within the discretion
                            of the governing body of a municipality clothed with power to enact and enforce ordinances for the observance of Sunday, and will be upheld, provided the classification is founded upon reasonable distinctions, affects all persons
                            similarly situated or engaged in the same business without discrimination, and has some reasonable relation to the public peace, welfare and safety. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>,

                            Difference in Treatment of Businesses Must Have Reasonable Basis. - The objective of a municipal ordinance being the establishment of Sunday as a day of general rest and relaxation, the difference in treatment by the ordinance of two types of business
                            must be supported by a reasonable basis for the conclusion that one, substantially more than the other, will interfere with such use and enjoyment of the day. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson,
                            <cite

                            Burden of Showing Absence of Reasonable Basis on Complainant. - The legislative body has wide discretion in determining which activities do and which activities do not interfere with the observance of Sunday as a day of general rest and relaxation sufficiently
                            to justify the prohibition of those activities on that day. The burden rests upon the person complaining to establish the absence of a reasonable basis for such determination. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson,

                        <p>
                            Prohibition of Ordinary Business Pursuits. - It is against the public policy of the State that one should pursue his ordinary business calling on Sunday, and it is very generally understood not only that ordinary business pursuits may be regulated, but
                            altogether prohibited on Sunday. State v. Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 682</cite>, 86 S.E. 597 (1915); State v. Burbage, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 876</cite>, 89 S.E. 795 (1916).

                            Sunday closing ordinance which singled out and banned the operation of billiard halls on Sunday, but permitted other businesses which provided facilities for recreation, sports and amusements, which were potentially as equally disruptive, violated the
                            equal protection clauses of the North Carolina and United States Constitutions. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 8 (1972).

                            Opening of Drugstores Only. - An ordinance of a town may, under the provisions of this section, prohibit the opening of all places of business on Sunday, except drugstores, and it is not an unreasonable regulation, under the police power of the town,
                            inasmuch as drugstores are open all day Sunday, for the governing authorities to further provide that they may sell articles of common use which are quasi-necessities to many, such as mineral waters, soft drinks, cigars and
                            tobacco, only between certain hours of that day. State v. Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 682</cite>, 86 S.E. 597 (1915).

                        <p>
                            Failure to Except Department Stores Upheld. - A municipal ordinance prohibiting generally the operation of all businesses within a municipality on Sunday, but excepting certain businesses, including hotels, drugstores, magazine stands, etc., did not result
                            in unlawful discrimination in regard to general department stores, even though such stores had departments selling the same types of goods as stores within the classifications excepted from the ordinance, since the classification
                            of general department stores, as distinguished from drugstores, bakeries, etc., was based upon a reasonable distinction and the ordinance operated equally upon all within several classifications. Clark's Charlotte, Inc. v.
                            Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 222</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 364 (1964).

                            Sunday observance ordinance classifying "sporting goods and toys" as prohibited items and live bait as permitted was not unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 1</cite>,

                            Prohibition of Sales of Mobile But Not Conventional Homes. - A municipal ordinance which prohibited the sale on Sunday of mobile homes but which did not prohibit the sale on Sunday of conventional homes was valid, since a classification based on the differences
                            between the two types of selling, i.e., presence or absence of traffic, congestion, and noise, bore a reasonable relation to the purpose of the ordinance in establishing Sunday as a day of rest and relaxation. Raleigh Mobile

                        <p>
                            Sale of Coca-Cola. - Regulating the sale of merchandise, drinks, etc., on Sunday is a valid exercise of the police powers of an incorporated city or town. And while the service of meals within the municipality at restaurants, etc., was a necessity (permitting
                            the sale of coffee, tea, etc.), the sale of Coca-Cola as a part of the meals could be prohibited by ordinance. State v. Weddington, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 643</cite>, 125 S.E. 257 (1924).

                        <p>
                            Differential Fines Upheld. - An ordinance of a town, authorized by statute, imposing a fine of $25.00 upon drugstores for selling cigars, etc., on Sunday, and a fine of $5.00 for the same offense upon restaurants, cafes, and lunch stands, declaring the
                            same to be a misdemeanor, related to distinct and easily severable occupations, and in the absence of any finding that those engaged in them came in competition with each other, the ordinance would not be declared unconstitutional
                            and invalid upon the ground that it was discretionary against the owners of drugstores. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 809</cite>, 89 S.E. 40 (1916).

                            Classification of Occupations. - The General Assembly or municipal corporation has the power to classify different occupations, provided the classification is not unreasonable and oppressive, and usually the extent to which the power will be exercised
                            is for the General Assembly or the governing body of the municipality. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 809</cite>, 89 S.E. 40 (1916). See also, State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 648</cite>,

                            Power to Close Business at Certain Hours. - The right of a city to restrict hours of business is restricted to cases when it is for the protection and benefit of the public. It has no power to require a merchant to close his store at an early hour because
                            other merchants so desire to close all stores at a regular early hour. State v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 814</cite>, 42 S.E. 960 (1902).

                            Sitting in Place of Business After Closing Time. - A city has power to restrict the use of property insofar as it may injure others, but it has no power to provide against a person sitting in his place of business after a time prescribed for closing it.

                            Conflict with State Building Code. - An interpretation of this section to allow a city ordinance requiring sprinkler systems, thus empowering a city to ignore explicit statewide legislative enactments, would, in effect, permit a city to amend the North
                            Carolina Building Code by the simple expedient of codifying a contested ordinance as a part of its fire prevention code and thereby to evade the clear requirements of G.S. 143-138(e). Greene v. City of Winston-Salem,

                            It is not necessary to the validity of an ordinance regulating the establishment of gasoline filling stations in a municipality that it substantially comply with the provisions of the statutes as to zoning, since the regulation of filling stations comes
                            within the State police power which has been conferred on municipalities by the general law. Shuford v. Town of Waynesville, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 135</cite>, 198 S.E. 585 (1938).

                            Fluoridation Ordinance. - A municipal ordinance for the fluoridation of the city water supply is enacted in the exercise of public policy, and the courts will not interfere therewith in the absence of a showing that the ordinance is so unreasonable, oppressive,
                            and subversive as to amount to an abuse rather than a legitimate exercise of the legislative power. Stroupe v. Eller, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 573</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 240 (1964).

                            Mobile Home Is Not a Nuisance Per Se. - Subdivision (26) of former G.S. 160-200 conferred upon cities and towns the power to prevent and abate nuisances, but a mobile home is not a nuisance per se. Town of Conover v. Jolly,

                            Mobile Home May Not Be Prohibited Per Se. - A well-constructed and equipped mobile home connected with the public water, sewer and electric systems could not be deemed per se "detrimental to the health, morals, comfort, safety, convenience and welfare
                            of the people" of a town within the purview of subdivision (6) of former G.S. 160-200; consequently, that subdivision did not confer upon a municipality the authority to enact an ordinance prohibiting the use anywhere within
                            its limits of a single mobile home as a permanent residence. Town of Conover v. Jolly, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 439</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 879 (1970).

                            Zoning Ordinance Preempted by ABC Permit. - In case in which petitioner, without objection by respondent board, argued that the decision of the ABC Commission to grant him a permit preempted respondent's denial of his special exception use permit request,
                            since the zoning ordinance, upon which respondent's denial was based, attempted to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages, which is a violation of State law, the trial court did not err in concluding that petitioner, as the
                            holder of a valid ABC permit issued by the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, was entitled to be issued a city beer license, and in ordering the tax collector of the city to issue any city license. Melkonian v. Board

                            Abatement of Encroachment on Street by Buildings. - Any permanent structure which materially encroaches upon a public street and impedes travel is a nuisance per se, and may be abated, notwithstanding space is left for the passage of the public; a failure
                            on the part of the city to abate it in a reasonable time will make it liable as a joint tort-feasor. Graham v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 649</cite>, 120 S.E. 466 (1923).

                            Forbidding Lumber Yards in Residential Sections. - It is within the valid discretionary exercise of the police powers of a municipality to pass an ordinance forbidding the erection of lumber yards within a long-established, exclusively residential portion,
                            and when this discretionary power has not been abused the courts will not interfere. Turner v. City of New Bern, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 541</cite>, 122 S.E. 469 (1924); Angelo v. City of

                            Disinfection of Secondhand Clothing. - A city has power to require that a dealer in secondhand clothing turn them over to the city to be disinfected, and exercise of such power cannot be considered as a restriction of an owner over his property, but only
                            the proper and lawful use of authority to protect the health of its citizens from diseases. Rosenbaum v. City of New Bern, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 83</cite>, 24 S.E. 1 (1896).

                            Regulation of Perishable Food Markets. - A city, in the exercise of statutory authority, may enact a valid penal ordinance as affecting the health of its citizens, and under its police power, require that meats, fish, oysters, and perishable matter be
                            sold at a sanitary market building containing refrigeration and other sanitary methods, under proper inspection, where adequate accommodation may be obtained at a reasonable rental, not for profit, and the city may exclude
                            such business within a prescribed territory therefrom, the location of the markethouse being reasonably suitable to the business or trades specified. Angelo v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 207</cite>,

                            Board of town commissioners could forbid the keeping of hog pens in the town to such an extent as they might deem necessary to prevent nuisances to the public, and, indeed, they could have done so without express authority. State v. Hord,

                            Regulation of Swine Farms. - County's ordinances attempting to regulate swine farms were invalid because the state had established a comprehensive scheme of regulation that indicated the General Assembly's intention to regulate this area on a state-wide
                            basis, leaving no room for local regulation. Craig v. County of Chatham, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 40</cite>, 565 S.E.2d 172 (2002).

                            Town ordinance dealing with dogs running at large was not inconsistent with former G.S. 106-381, which statute was designed to provide minimum protection against vicious dogs in all parts of the State (rural, urban, small villages and large cities). With
                            more concentrated population, cities are justified in adopting stricter regulations for dogs and are authorized to require a higher standard of conduct or condition with respect to the keeping of dogs within its corporate limits
                            than was required by former G.S. 106-381 for the State generally. Pharo v. Pearson, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 220 S.E.2d 359 (1975).

                            <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 4.3, which limits the number of dogs allowed on property, is not unconstitutional; the ordinance did not set an arbitrary, immutable limit on the number of pets, but, rather, the number of dogs allowed was based
                            on the square footage of the lot, and there was no restriction on the number of dogs less than five months old. The record revealed that the town enacted the ordinance for the purpose of reducing noise and odor problems within
                            the city limits, which were clearly legitimate public purposes, and a limitation on the number of dogs per lot was directly connected to these objectives. State v. Maynard, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 757, 673

                            generally permitted to regulate vehicle towing and that it acted within its authority by enacting signage, notice, and payment requirements for towing from private lots; however, Chapel Hill exceeded those powers by imposing
                            a fee schedule and prohibiting towing companies from charging credit card fees. King v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 400</cite>, 758 S.E.2d 364 (2014).

         Regulatory Authority of State over Speed of Trains May Not Be Delegated to Cities and Towns.

                            delegate to its cities powers it is authorized by Congress to exercise. Johnson v. Southern Ry., 654 F. Supp. 121 (W.D.N.C. 1987).

                        and penalties, however, is limited to those remedies and penalties available in this section. Town of Pine Knoll Shores v. Evans, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 407 S.E.2d 895 (1991).

      </b> - The preamble to Session Laws 2005-441, reads: "Whereas, the clearing of obstructions in streams, such as dead trees, fallen tree limbs, root balls, underbrush, and trash and debris furthers the health, safety, and welfare
                    of the State's citizens by allowing such streams to function more efficiently to remove stormwater, thus reducing flooding; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, local governments are deterred from engaging in stream-clearing activities by the possibility that they will become legally responsible for regular stream clearing, or the possibility that they will become legally responsible for the impact
                    on private properties of natural events such as flooding, which have never been the legal responsibility of local governments; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, many private landowners do not have the resources to clear obstructions from the streams that are located on their property, and it is in the public interest to facilitate the establishment of stream-clearing programs by local governments; Now,

                                elections.     The proposition submitted to the voters shall be substantially in the following form: "Shall the property tax rate limitation applicable to the City/Town of ____________ be increased from ____________ on

                                approve the proposition, the rate limitation imposed in subsection (c) shall be increased for the city.     (g)  With respect to any of the categories listed in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the city may provide
                                the necessary personnel, land, buildings, equipment, supplies, and financial support from property tax revenues for the program, function, or service.     (h)  This section does not authorize any city to undertake any program,
                                function, joint undertaking, or service not otherwise authorized by law. It is intended only to authorize the levy of property taxes within the limitations set out herein to finance programs, functions, or services authorized

                        That an ordinance imposing a privilege license tax on cyber-gambling businesses taxed each computer terminal within each business did not mean it unlawfully classified property for taxation. The city was not taxing individual computer terminals for the
                        sake of taxing computers, but was taxing businesses for the privilege of carrying out cyber-gambling through the use of computer terminals, and such a tax was authorized by G.S. 160A-211. IMT, Inc. v. City of Lumberton,

                        City's privilege license tax on cyber-gambling establishments was not invalid because it exempted state-endorsed lotteries from taxation, as the state-endorsed lotteries provided net revenues to the state Education Lottery Fund and thus reasonably constituted
                        a separate classification from unendorsed gambling. IMT, Inc. v. City of Lumberton, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 724 S.E.2d 588 (2012).

                        City's privilege license tax on cyber-gambling establishments did not violate N.C. Const. art. V,

                        Purpose. - Former statute imposed a license tax for the purpose of raising revenue, and not an ad valorem tax. Nor did the statute seek to regulate chain stores under the police power, and the tax was in accord with the fiscal policy of the State of raising
                        revenue for State purposes by the imposition of taxes on trades, professions, franchises and incomes, and leaving to the counties and municipalities for their support ad valorem taxes on real and personal property. Great Atl. &amp;

                        Prior Law Invalid. - Prior law which imposed a license tax of $50.00 each on stores operated in this State where there were six or more such stores under the same management, but which imposed no such tax on other mercantile establishments doing the same
                        business when there were less than six stores under one management, was held an arbitrary classification and unconstitutional. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Doughton, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 145</cite>,

                        a municipal ordinance imposing a license tax upon the operation of passenger vehicles for hire in addition to the $1.00 theretofore imposed by it upon motor vehicles generally was void, and could not be sustained upon the theory
                        that it was a tax upon the business of operating a motor vehicle for hire rather than upon ownership of the vehicle, since the word "business " and the word "use," as used in the section, meant the same thing. Cox v. Brown,

                        a return for State sales and use taxes. The governing board of the taxing city has the same authority to waive the penalties for a room occupancy tax that the Secretary of Revenue has to waive the penalties for State sales and

                    If a taxable accommodation is furnished as part of a package, the bundled transaction provisions in G.S. 105-164.4D apply in determining the sales price of the taxable accommodation. If those provisions do not address the type of package offered, the
                    person offering the package may determine an allocated price for each item in the package based on a reasonable allocation of revenue that is supported by the person's business records kept in the ordinary course of business and calculate
                    tax on the allocated price of the taxable accommodation.

                <p>
                    A retailer must separately state the room occupancy tax. Room occupancy taxes paid to a retailer are held in trust for and on account of the taxing city.

                <p>
                    The taxing city shall design and furnish to all appropriate businesses and persons in the city the necessary forms for filing returns and instructions to ensure the full collection of the tax. An operator of a business who collects a room occupancy tax
                    may deduct from the amount remitted to the taxing city a discount equal to the discount the State allows the retailer for State sales and use tax.

                        Tax Authorized. - A city may, by ordinance, impose a tax at the rate of eight tenths percent (0.8%) on the gross receipts from the short-term lease or rental of heavy equipment by a person whose principal business is the short-term lease or rental of
                        heavy equipment at retail. The heavy equipment subject to this tax is exempt from property tax under G.S. 105-275, and this tax provides an alternative to a property tax on the equipment. A person is not considered to be in the
                        short-term lease or rental business if the majority of the person's lease and rental gross receipts are derived from leases and rentals to a person who is a related person under G.S. 105-163.010.

                        the quarter. The tax is intended to be added to the amount charged for the short-term lease or rental of heavy equipment and paid to the heavy equipment business by the person to whom the heavy equipment is leased or rented.

                        the Secretary of Revenue in imposing these penalties and remedies.

                    The tax authorized by this section applies to gross receipts that are subject to tax under G.S. 105-164.4(a)(2). Gross receipts from the short-term lease or rental of heavy equipment are subject to a tax imposed by a city under this section if the place
                    of business from which the heavy equipment is delivered is located in the city.

                        Power to Impose Assessments Within Right of Taxation. - The power to impose assessments upon owners whose lands abut upon the streets of a city to be improved comes within the sovereign right of taxation, and no license, permit, or franchise from the
                        legislature or a municipal board will be construed to establish an exemption from the proper exercise of this power, or in derogation of it, unless such bodies are acting clearly within their authority, and the grant itself is
                        in terms so clear and explicit as to be free from substantial doubt. City of Durham v. Durham Pub. Serv. Co., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 333</cite>, 109 S.E. 40 (1921), aff'd, 261 U.S. 149, 43 S. Ct.

                        Liability of Municipal Parks for Assessments. - Absent constitutional or statutory provisions to the contrary, the public property of a municipality, such as parks, etc., is subject to assessment for local improvements of its streets; hence, when there
                        is no provision exempting same, a public park of a city was included within the intent and meaning of Laws 1915, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.056.html" target="_blank">Chapter 56</a></cite>,
                        providing that lands abutting on a street to be paved or improved should be assessed for such improvements to the extent of the respective frontage of the lots thereon, in a certain proportionate part of the cost, by the "front
                        foot" rule. Town of Tarboro v. Forbes, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 59</cite>, 116 S.E. 81 (1923).

                        Interference by Courts. - Where an act allows assessments to be made by a city on property abutting on a street for pavement or improvements thereon, the legislative declaration on the subject is conclusive as to the necessity and benefit of the proposed
                        improvements, and in applying the principle and estimating the amount as against the owners, individual or corporate, the court may interfere only in case of palpable and gross abuse. Kinston v. Atlantic &amp; N.C.R.R.,

                        Procedure Must Fulfill Essential Requirements. - While a slight informality of procedure or a failure to observe a provision which is merely directory will not generally affect the validity of an assessment, it is nevertheless true that any substantial
                        and material departure from the essential requirements of the law under which the improvement is made will render an assessment therefor invalid. Town of Tarboro v. Forbes, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 59</cite>,
                        116 S.E. 81 (1923).

                    <p>
                        Invalidity of Assessment Absent Proper Petition. - An assessment for widening a street under contract with the Highway Commission (now Board of Transportation) without petition of a majority of the owners is invalid. Sechriest v. City of Thomasville,
                        <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 108</cite>, 162 S.E. 212 (1932).

                    <p>
                        Absence of Petition Cured by Legislation. - When improvements are made under an assessment, and there has been no petition as required by statute, the assessments are invalid. However, this defect may be cured by a validating act of the legislature although
                        the act is retrospective. Holton v. Town of Mockville, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 144</cite>, 126 S.E. 326 (1925); Gallimore v. City of Thomasville, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 648</cite>, 132 S.E.

                    <p>
                        Where levies are made without a petition, the assessments are invalid but not void, and the legislature has the power to validate the assessments by subsequent legislative act, since the legislature had the power to authorize the assessments in the first
                        instance. Crutchfield v. City of Thomasville, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 709</cite>, 172 S.E. 366 (1934).

                        The General Assembly, which has the power to confer upon the authorities of a municipal corporation the power to improve its streets and sidewalks and to assess the owners of abutting property with a part of the cost of such improvements without a petition,
                        as indicated by this section, also has the power to validate proceedings for the improvement of streets and sidewalks which were begun and which have been concluded without an initial petition. Crutchfield v. City of Thomasville,

                        When Governing Body's Determination as to Sufficiency of Petition Is Conclusive. - Where it appears upon the face of a petition, as a matter of law, that the signers of the petition do not represent a majority of the lineal feet of the total frontage
                        on the street proposed to be improved, the determination of the governing body as to the sufficiency of the petition is not final or conclusive. Insofar as the sufficiency of the petition involves only questions of fact, the determination
                        of the governing body, in the absence of fraud, and when acting in good faith, is final and conclusive. City of Tarboro v. Forbes, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 59</cite>, 116 S.E. 81 (1923); Gallimore
                        v. City of Thomasville, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 648</cite>, 132 S.E. 657 (1926).

                        Where municipal authorities have approved the petition of owners of land abutting upon a street proposed to be improved in accordance with the statute, their approval and order for the improvements to be made is final, except where it appears from the
                        face of the petition, as a matter of law, that the signers do not represent a majority of the owners or of the lineal feet required by statute. Jones v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 127</cite>,

                        Complaint Alleging Invalidity of Petition Held Insufficient. - In an action to have an assessment levied against plaintiff's property declared invalid, a complaint alleging that only one of the signatures of abutting property owners to the petition for
                        improvements was valid, without alleging that the assessment was based on the petition, what other signatures appeared on the petition, or facts supporting the conclusion that the other signatures were invalid, was insufficient
                        to state a cause of action, and demurrer to the complaint was properly sustained. Broadway v. Town of Asheboro, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 232</cite>, 108 S.E.2d 441 (1959).

                    <p>
                        When City Owns Part of Abutting Land. - A town is subject to assessment on its abutting property, and the rule of a majority of lineal feet and number of owners will apply just the same when a city owns a part of the abutting land as any other time. And
                        if the city fails to sign when its signature is necessary to have a majority of lineal feet, the assessment is a nullity. Town of Tarboro v. Forbes, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 59</cite>, 116 S.E. 81
                        (1923).

                        Improvement of Only One Side of Street. - An assessment levied for street improvements on abutting property owners is not void on the ground that the assessment was for improving only one side of a street. Town of Waxhaw v. Seaboard A.L. Ry.,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">195 N.C. 550</cite>, 142 S.E. 761 (1928).

                    <p>
                        Signatures as Evidence of Agency. - Where wife owned the locus in quo and petition for public improvements was signed by both husband and wife, the signature of the wife as the owner of the property along with the signature of the husband was sufficient

                    When any city proposes to make local improvements that would benefit lands owned by the State of North Carolina or any board, agency, commission, or institution thereof, the council may request the Council of State to consent to special assessments against

                    available funds. If consent to the assessment is refused, the state-owned property shall be exempt from assessment.

                    increasing, or reducing them as may be proper in compliance with the basis of assessment. If any property is omitted from the preliminary assessment roll, the council may place it on the roll and levy the proper assessment. Whenever
                    the council confirms assessments for any project, the city clerk shall enter in the minutes of the council the date, hour, and minute of confirmation. From and after the time of confirmation, the assessments shall be a lien on the
                    property assessed of the same nature and to the same extent as the lien for county and city property taxes, according to the priorities set out in G.S. 160A-233(c). After the assessment roll is confirmed, a copy of it shall be delivered
                    to the city tax collector for collection in the same manner as property taxes, except as herein provided.

                        Assessments as Liens on Property. - Assessments made upon property for street and sidewalk improvements by a town, in all respects under the authority conferred on the municipality by statute, to be paid in partial payments over a designated period of
                        time, are to be regarded in the nature of a statutory mortgage when due and payable; they constitute liens on the property within the warranty clause against encumbrances contained in a deed, and are recoverable in grantee's action
                        against grantor to the extent he has been required to pay them. Coble v. Dick, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 732</cite>, 140 S.E. 745 (1927).

                        Within Meaning of Warranty Against Encumbrances. - The lien for street assessments is an encumbrance within the meaning of the warranty clause against encumbrances contained in a deed. Coble v. Dick, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 732</cite>,
                        140 S.E. 745 (1927); City of Winston-Salem v. Powell Paving Co., 7 F. Supp. 424 (M.D.N.C. 1934).

                        Lien Is Based on Theory of Special Benefit to Property. - The lien against property for street improvements is a lien in rem against the land itself, but is not strictly a tax lien and is based upon the theory of special benefit to the property itself.
                        Town of Saluda v. Polk County, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 180</cite>, 176 S.E. 298 (1934).

                    <p>
                        Lien Not Enforceable Against Estate of Decedent. - An assessment made upon adjoining land for a street improvement by a town is a charge upon the land constituting a lien superior to all others, but is not enforceable against the personalty or other lands
                        of the owner; and when the owner of land has been thus assessed, payable in installments, and he subsequently dies, such assessment is not a debt of the deceased payable by his personal representative, but a charge against the
                        land itself. The provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa19s28A-19-6" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-19-6</a></cite>, as to the order of payment of debts of the deceased, have

                    <p>
                        When Lien Attaches. - The lien for street assessments does not attach to land until confirmation of the assessments; thus, where such assessments are not confirmed by the governing body of the town until after the execution of a deed to the property,
                        the subsequently attaching lien for the assessments does not violate the warranty and covenant in the deed, in the usual language, against encumbrances. Oliver v. Hecht, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 481</cite>,

                        Owner's Ratification as Sufficient Compliance with Statute. - Where property owner signs the petition and has notice that improvements are to be made and notice that the assessment roll giving the amount of the assessment against his property has been
                        filed in the office of the city clerk, and he accepts the benefits and pays installments of the assessments without objection, he ratifies same and the statute is sufficiently complied with. Town of Wake Forest v. Holding,

                        Right of Appeal Makes Statute Constitutional. - The right of appeal to the courts being provided in case of dissatisfaction by an owner of land abutting on a street assessed by the governing body of a municipality for street improvement, the objection
                        that the owner's property is taken for a public use in contravention of the due process clause of the Constitution is untenable. Leak v. Town of Wadesboro, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 683</cite>, 121
                        S.E. 12 (1923).

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction of Court is Derivative. - The jurisdiction of the court upon appeal from a levy of assessments for street improvements by the governing body of a town, as provided by statute, is entirely derivative, and where a town has no jurisdiction to
                        condemn land the court on appeal likewise has no jurisdiction to do so. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Town of Ahoskie, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 154</cite>, 176 S.E. 264 (1934).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Original jurisdiction to determine questions of fact involved in assessment proceedings is derived from the General Assembly and vested in the city council. Since a property owner's right of appeal from the city council to the courts is created and governed
                        by statute, the jurisdiction acquired is derivative. On appeal to the courts, the owner of assessed property has no right to be heard there on the question of whether the lands are benefitted or not, but only on the validity of
                        the assessment, its proper apportionment and other questions of law. In re Dunn, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 326 S.E.2d 309, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 602</cite>, 332

                        Superior court may not determine de novo questions within the city council's original jurisdiction. In re Dunn, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 326 S.E.2d 309, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 602</cite>,

                    <p>
                        While a petition is a prerequisite, it is not jurisdictional, and if the finding by the municipal board is erroneous, it should be corrected by appeal. Town of Asheboro v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 298</cite>, 17 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        The language providing that appeals "shall be tried as other actions at law," serves merely to distinguish those actions from special proceedings for purposes of determining the applicable procedural rules. In re Dunn, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite>                        243, 326 S.E.2d 309, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 602</cite>, 332 S.E.2d 180 (1985).

                        Appeal Not Limited to Amount of Assessment. - Former similar statute did not limit the property owner's appeal from an assessment for public improvements solely to the amount to be charged against his land. Smith v. City of Rockingham,

                        Existence of Street as Issue. - Under the provisions of former similar statute, it was necessary that there be an existing street in order for a valid assessment for improvements to be laid on the property of abutting owners, and this could be made an
                        issue in an appeal, with the adjoining owner introducing his evidence to show to the contrary. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Town of Ahoskie, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 258</cite>, 134 S.E. 653 (1926).

                        validity of the ordinance or of the assessment for any alleged irregularities which are not jurisdictional. Town of Asheboro v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 298</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 105 (1941).

                        Injunctive Relief Not Available After Failure to Appeal. - The remedy of abutting owners assessed for street improvements is given by the provisions for the right of appeal, and when no appeal has been taken and the work has been completed, injunctive
                        relief against the collection of the assessments by the city will not lie. Jones v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 127</cite>, 147 S.E. 824 (1929).

                        Remedy is to Object to Local Assessment. - The owner of land abutting on a street which the municipality proposes to improve has his remedy in objecting to the local assessment on his property because of the insufficiency of the petition, and he may not
                        enjoin the issuance of bonds for this necessary expense on that ground when he has failed to pursue his statutory remedy. Brown v. Town of Hillsboro, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 368</cite>, 117 S.E. 41

                        Untimely Application for Writ of Certiorari. - An abutting property owner who failed to appeal from a final order of the board of aldermen affirming the assessment roll was not entitled to a writ of certiorari where application for the writ was filed
                        more than eight months after his time for appeal had expired. Sanford v. Southern Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 388</cite>, 93 S.E.2d 560 (1956).

                    The council shall have the power, when in its judgment any irregularity, omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings related thereto, has occurred, to set aside the whole of any special assessment made by it and thereupon to make
                    a reassessment. In that case, all additional interest paid, or to be paid, as a result of the delay in confirming the assessment shall be included as a part of the project cost. The proceeding shall, as far as practicable, in all respects
                    take place as it had with the original assessments, and the reassessment shall have the same force as if it had originally been properly made.

                        Reduction of Assessment Held Unavailable on Grounds Urged. - Where the board of aldermen granted a petition for street improvements requesting the assessment of a larger proportion of the costs of the improvements against the lots of land abutting directly
                        thereon than was otherwise required by statute, after the confirmation of the assessment roll a subsequent board of aldermen was without power to grant a petition of the abutting landowners for a reduction of the assessment upon
                        the ground alone that the amount of the assessments exceeded that which they had originally anticipated, and a suit by other taxpayers of the town to enjoin the granting of such petition was proper. McClester v. Town of China Grove,

                        Assessments Not Preference Against Estate of Deceased Life Tenant. - Since street and sidewalk assessments constitute a lien against the property not collectible out of other properties belonging to the owner, and since a life tenant is not liable for
                        the whole assessment, being entitled to have it proportioned, upon the death of a life tenant such assessments made prior to his death do not constitute a preference against his estate payable as a tax assessed on the estate prior
                        to his death. Rigsbee v. Brogden, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 510</cite>, 184 S.E. 24 (1936), decided under former similar statutory provisions.

                    the time of making an apportionment under this section, the council shall enter on its minutes a statement to the effect that the apportionment is made with the consent of the owners of the property affected, and this entry shall be
                    conclusive in the absence of fraud. Reassessments made under this section may include past due installments of principal and interest as well as installments not then due, and any installments not then due shall fall due at the same
                    dates as they would have under the original assessment. The council may delegate authority to make apportionment of assessments to the chief financial officer, but apportionments shall in all cases be reported to the council at its
                    next regular meeting and entered in the minutes.

                        Power Not Restricted Where Land and City in Same County. - Summary judgment was properly entered in a declaratory action regarding the applicability of G.S. 153A-15(b) because a condemnation action by a city in order to facilitate the construction of
                        a water supply and distribution facility did not require any approval since the city and the land were located in the same county; moreover, the evidence showed that the real and substantial benefits of the condemnation accrued
                        to the city in question, and not other parties in the case that were located in different counties. Caswell County v. Town of Yanceyville, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 611 S.E.2d 451 (2005).

                        City's Lawful Exercise of its Eminent Domain Power. - City lawfully exercised its eminent domain power because, consistent with the mandates of G.S. 160A-4 and G.S. 160A-312, the city could acquire property by condemnation to establish a gas transmission
                        and distribution system, even in the absence of a concrete, immediate plan to furnish gas services to its citizens as the acquisition was for a public use by the city in compliance with G.S. 160A-240.1 and

                        Proper Exercise of Police Power. - In condemnation proceeding brought pursuant to city's power of eminent domain under G.S. 160A-240.1, partial summary judgment was properly granted precluding property owners from recovering for diminution in value caused
                        by the city's construction of a median restricting access to lanes in only one direction of travel; the separation of lanes of traffic was an exercise of police power, and the means used to accomplish the legitimate objective were
                        reasonable in light of the fact that the owners still had free ingress and egress to their property, and injury to property caused by such an exercise of police power was not compensable. City of Concord v. Stafford,

                        County Had Authority to Lease Property. - Although the taxpayers argued that the proposed ballot language for the 2004 Park Bonds was intended to preclude the use of the property as a professional baseball stadium, when the 2004 Park Bond only restricted
                        the expenditure of bond proceeds on a stadium for professional baseball, and the disbursed money was subsequently repaid, there was no substantial deviation from the purpose for which the bonds were approved under G.S. 159-135.
                        Further, G.S. 160A-265, made applicable to counties by G.S. 153A-176, stated that counties may: (i) hold, use, change the use thereof to other uses; or (ii) sell or dispose of real and personal property, without regard to the method

                        and refuted his argument that an exchange of properties contemplated by an interlocal agreement was hastily arranged; therefore the claim failed to overcome the presumption of legality afforded to acts by public officials. The
                        allegations were grievances, rather than allegations sufficient to demonstrate bad faith circumvention of the statutory requirements of G.S. 160A-266. Reese v.

                        What Real Estate May Be Sold. - Town or city authorities may sell any personal property, or sell or lease any real estate which belongs to such town or city, as the surplus of the original acreage ceded for the town or city site, or such land as may have
                        been subsequently acquired or purchased. But in no case may such power be extended to the sale or lease of any real estate which is to be held in trust for the use of the town, or any real estate which is devoted to the purpose
                        of government. To enable the town to sell such real estate there must be a special act of the General Assembly authorizing such sale or lease. Southport v. Stanly, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 464</cite>,

                        Conveyance of Land Dedicated for Street. - When a city conveys land bounded by an established street, and the grantee enters upon and improves the land, a subsequent conveyance by the corporation of the land covered by the street, whereby the easement
                        of the appurtenant owner is interfered with, is void. But where there have been no improvements made on a dedicated street and the dedicated land has never been used as a street, a city by an act of legislature conferring authority
                        may sell and convey the land so dedicated to it for street purposes. Moose v. Carson, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 431</cite>, 10 S.E. 689 (1889); Church v. Dula, <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. 262</cite>,

                        Sale of Property Conveyed to County. - By the July deed, the property owner conveyed his entire fee simple absolute interest in the property to the county, and the additional language in the deed did not create any limitations or conditions upon the fee
                        simple interest; moreover, municipalities and counties had statutory authority to change the use of real property or to sell or dispose of real property, without regard to the method or purpose of its acquisition or to its intended
                        or actual governmental or other prior use, G.S. 160A-265, and the heirs had not alleged that the county did not follow proper statutory procedures under G.S. 160A-266 et seq., in its sale of the property to the company. Therefore,
                        summary judgment in favor of the heirs on the basis of express or implied dedication of the property to use as a site for a courthouse or county offices or a public park was in error and was reversed; as there were no genuine issues
                        of material fact and the company was entitled to judgment as a matter of law quieting title to the property under G.S. 41-10, the trial court should have granted summary judgment to the company as to its action to quiet title,
                        and should have granted summary judgment in favor of the county and the company by way of declaratory judgment pursuant to G.S. 1-253 et seq., on all substantive issues. Metcalf v. Black Dog Realty, LLC,

                        County Had Authority to Lease Property. - County, by G.S. 160A-266, had authority to lease its property, none of the changes to the lease altered any material conditions of the lease, and the notice published prior to December 2007 was legally sufficient.
                        The taxpayers did not show a likelihood of success on the merits of his case, and the trial court properly denied their motion for a preliminary injunction. Further, G.S. 160A-272, made applicable to counties through G.S. 153A-176,
                        provided that leases for terms of more than 10 years shall be treated as a sale of property and may be executed by following any of the procedures authorized for sale of real property, and the lease between the county and the team
                        was for longer than ten years and was thus by statute treated as a sale between the two parties. Reese v. Mecklenburg County, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 685 S.E.2d 34 (2009), review

                        This section empowers a city to lease or rent any property owned by the city for such terms and upon such conditions as the council may determine. This power is to be exercised by the governing body of the municipality acting in its proprietary, rather
                        than its governmental capacity. Lewis v. City of Washington, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 305 S.E.2d 752, modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 818</cite>, 310 S.E.2d

                        The city's proprietary or corporate power to contract for the leasing of its property is limited. It cannot be exercised so as to disadvantageously affect the governing body's governmental powers. The true test is whether the contract itself deprives
                        a governing body, or its successor, of a discretion which public policy demands should be left unimpaired. Lewis v. City of Washington, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 305 S.E.2d 752, modified

                        Leasing Property is a Proprietary Activity. - The rule of governmental immunity did not bar plaintiff's claim against the town because the town's execution of a lease of town property was proprietary in nature. Stephenson v. Town of Garner,

                        County, by G.S. 160A-266, had authority to lease its property, none of the changes to the lease altered any material conditions of the lease, and the notice published prior to December 2007 was legally sufficient. The taxpayers did not show a likelihood
                        of success on the merits of his case, and the trial court properly denied their motion for a preliminary injunction. Further, G.S. 160A-272, made applicable to counties through G.S. 153A-176, provided that leases for terms of more
                        than 10 years shall be treated as a sale of property and may be executed by following any of the procedures authorized for sale of real property, and the lease between the county and the team was for longer than ten years and was
                        thus by statute treated as a sale between the two parties. Reese v. Mecklenburg County, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 685 S.E.2d 34 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 242</cite>,

                        Governmental Immunity. - City was entitled to governmental immunity in a negligence action arising from a trip and fall at a building the city leased to an arts organization because the lease was a governmental function, as (1) the legislature provided
                        urban redevelopment activities undertaken to promote the health, safety, and welfare of North Carolina citizens were governmental functions, (2) the legislature determined private enterprise alone could not address urban blight,
                        (3) the lease was a valid urban redevelopment and downtown revitalization activity, (4) the city did not seek to make a profit from the lease, and (5) the fees the city charged under the lease were not substantial and did not cover
                        the city's operating costs. Meinck v. City of Gastonia, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 497</cite>, 819 S.E.2d 353 (2018).

                    A city shall have authority to grant easements over, through, under, or across any city property or the right-of-way of any public street or alley that is not a part of the State highway system. Easements in a street or alley right-of-way shall not be

                    or other permanent structure (other than utility wires or pipes) shall be treated as a sale of real property, except that a grant of air rights over a street right-of-way for the purpose of constructing a bridge or passageway between
                    existing buildings on opposite sides of the street shall be treated as a grant of an easement.

                        Presumption of Legality and Correctness. - Board of education's resolution to authorize its chairman to approve an interlocal agreement was afforded a presumption of legality and correctness: (1) G.S. 160A-274, G.S. 153A-158, G.S. 115C-36, and G.S. 115C-518
                        authorized the board, upon such terms and conditions as it deemed wise, to exchange property owned by the board, based upon a determination that the property was no longer suitable and necessary for public school purposes; (2)
                        the board determined that the replacement office space in the Government Center was more suitable for its needs; (3) this determination was adequate to meet the unnecessary or unsuitable requirement of G.S. 115C-518, (4) plaintiff
                        failed to overcome the presumption of legality afforded public officials; therefore (5) plaintiff's complaint did not state a cause of action, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,

                        complaint did not allege, nor did answers admit, that either a city or a county had agreed, hastily or otherwise, to pay or exchange property for less than the appraised or fair market value, in violation of G.S. 160A-274. Reese

                    Any city, county, or other municipal corporation is authorized to execute and deliver deeds to any real property with full covenants of warranty, without regard to how the property was acquired, when, in the opinion of the governing body, it is in the

                        This section extends the extraterritorial power of city police officers beyond the mere power to arrest found in subsection (c) of G.S. 15A-402. State v. Treants, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 203, 298 S.E.2d 438 (1982),

                    <p>
                        This section and G.S. 15A-402 must be analyzed to determine what area the territorial jurisdiction of a municipal law-enforcement officer actually encompasses. State v. Treants, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 203, 298
                        S.E.2d 438 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 702</cite>, 301 S.E.2d 395 (1983).

                        In light of G.S. 15A-402 and G.S. 160A-286, North Carolina courts would not recognize a claim for negligence against a university or its police force for failing to intervene or interfere with a municipality's exercise of its statutory police powers.
                        McFadyen v. Duke Univ., 786 F. Supp. 2d 887 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 31, 2011), aff'd and rev'd in part, 703 F.3d 636 (2012).

                    <p>
                        As a matter of law, city police had complete statutory authority under North Carolina law, on campus and off, pursuant to G.S. 15A-402 and G.S. 160A-286; jurisdictional agreement between the city police and university police could not reduce the city
                        police department's statutory authority, nor could it give the university police any authority over the city police, even on campus or in other areas around campus, regardless of whether the university police had "primary jurisdiction"
                        of an area under the agreement. McFadyen v. Duke Univ., 786 F. Supp. 2d 887 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 31, 2011), aff'd and rev'd in part, 703 F.3d 636 (2012).

                        City Not Required to Provide Fire Protection. - While a city is allowed to provide fire protection as a municipal service, it is not required by statute to provide such protection or to pay another for the provision of fire protection. Orange Water &amp;

                        No Liability for Failure to Furnish Adequate Pressure or Service. - The maintenance of a fire department for extinguishing fire without cost to the property owner is a governmental function, and there is no liability for failure to provide adequate pressure
                        or service in extinguishing a fire. Howland v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 749</cite>, 94 S.E. 524 (1917).

                    <p>
                        The power to regulate and prevent fire is governmental, and a failure to exercise this power does not subject a city to action for negligence which causes loss by fire. Harrington v. Town of Greenville, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. 632</cite>,

                        Liability for Negligence. - A city, in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary, is not liable for any damage occasioned by the negligence of its fire department. Mack v. City Water Works, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 383</cite>,

                    <p>
                        The extinguishment of fires is a function which a municipal corporation undertakes in its governmental capacity, and in connection with which, in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary, it incurs no civil liability, either for inadequacy in
                        equipment or for the negligence of its employees. Seales v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 469</cite>, 127 S.E. 543 (1925); Mabe v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 486</cite>,

                        Liability of City for Hydrant Fees. - Even absent statutory or express contractual liability to pay another for fire protection, justice and equity require a city to pay fire hydrant fees to a water and sewer authority where the authority intended to
                        maintain hydrants for the city's use, the city granted a 60-year franchise to the authority to install and maintain hydrants, free service was explicitly proscribed, the city knew of the hydrant charges, and the city paid such
                        charges until the rate was increased. The law implies a promise by the city to pay for such service. Otherwise, it would be unjustly enriched at the expense of the authority. Orange Water &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Town of Carrboro,

                        Scope of Liability. - A fire chief is a public official and, as such, his governmental immunity defense, in his official capacity, is waived to the extent of insurance coverage purchased by the town he serves; however, not he but the town is liable for
                        the acts of ordinary negligence of its public officials to the extent it has waived its immunity by purchasing insurance. Willis v. Town of Beaufort, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 544 S.E.2d

    §
   </span> 2(7) because by contracting to retain the employee for an extended period of time, the employer ensured that it would, for several years, have the service of a qualified fire chief without fear that the fire chief would
                        leave the employer for a better opportunity; the employment and retention of a qualified fire chief to execute the duties contained in G.S. 160A-292 involves a reasonable connection with the convenience and necessity of a municipality,
                        and the employment of a fire chief benefits the public generally, not just the fire chief or special interests, because the fire chief is responsible for maintaining the safety of the city and its citizens from fire. Elliott v.

                        Fallen Power Line - The city did not owe a special duty to a cable television repairman who was electrocuted by a fallen unmarked power line, and as plaintiff did not allege any intentional misconduct on the part of the city which would survive application
                        of the public duty doctrine, the city was immune to liability. Vanasek v. Duke Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 335, 511 S.E.2d 41 (1999).

                        Agreement to Furnish Fire Protection as Compensation for Easement Authorized. - A municipality has the authority to compensate landowners for a water and sewer line easement across a tract of land located outside the municipal limits by an agreement to

                        Agreement Does Not Constitute Waiver of Governmental Immunity. - An agreement by a municipality to furnish fire protection for property lying outside the municipality as compensation for a water line and sewer easement across such property does not constitute
                        a waiver of the municipality's governmental immunity with respect to torts committed in the maintenance or operation of its fire department. Valevais v.

                        Profit Does Not Make Municipality's Function Proprietary. - The fact that a water and sewer easement obtained by a municipality in exchange for its promise to furnish fire protection permitted the municipality to sell water at a profit did not make the
                        furnishing of such fire protection a proprietary rather than a governmental function. Valevais v. City of New Bern, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 178 S.E.2d 109 (1970);decided under former

                            over them might at all times do so with reasonable ease, speed and safety. Bunch v. Edenton, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 431</cite> (1886); Fitzgerald v. Concord, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 110</cite>,

                            While a city is not an insurer of the safety of one who uses its streets and sidewalks, it is under a duty to use due care to keep its streets and sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition for the ordinary use thereof. Mosseller v. City of Asheville,

                            The duty to maintain sidewalks and streets in a safe condition carries with it a correlative duty to perform these maintenance tasks in a competent manner or suffer the consequences of negligently inflicted damage which is foreseeable. Kaplan v. City

                            Duty extends to streets dedicated and accepted by the municipality, but not to streets or portions of streets not accepted by it, although dedicated by some individual. Hughes v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 457</cite>,

                            Duty to Sidewalks. - The rights, powers, and liability of the municipality extend equally to the sidewalk as to the roadway, for both are parts of the street, and towns and cities are held to the same degree of liability for failure to repair sidewalks
                            as to repair the other part of the street. Bunch v. Edenton, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 431</cite> (1886); Tate v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 392</cite>, 19 S.E. 767 (1894);

                            The duty of keeping its sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition rests primarily on a municipality. Kaplan v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 203 S.E.2d 653, rev'd on other grounds,

                        <p>
                            The evidence was not sufficient to raise an inference of negligence under this section where the plaintiff's experts testified that the depression in the sidewalk had existed for a number of years, had been at least one-half of an inch for 1-2 years before
                            the accident, and was contrary to the building code but a city employee testified that the records were void of any complaints of defects in the sidewalk; the law with regard to municipalities and maintenance of sidewalks is
                            such that minor defects are not actionable. Desmond v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 544 S.E.2d 269 (2001).

                        <p>
                            Summary judgment should not have been granted to a city in a negligence case because it had a statutory duty to maintain a sidewalk in a reasonably safe manner; there was no evidence that the North Carolina Department of Transportation had agreed to take
                            on maintenance responsibility in this case. Although the city's responsibility to maintain certain streets and bridges was limited, the same was not true for its responsibility to maintain sidewalks. Steele v. City of Durham,

                            Liability of Abutting Owner to Pedestrians for Hazardous Conditions on Sidewalk. - Insofar as pedestrians are concerned, any liability of the owner or occupant of abutting property for hazardous conditions existent upon the adjacent sidewalk is limited
                            to conditions created or maintained by him, and must be predicated upon his negligence in that respect. Dunning v. Forsyth Whse. Co., <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 723</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 893 (1968).

                            duty of the city to repair, alter, and improve the streets, as the city, in its discretion, may deem proper, and to construct therein sewers and other improvements for the public benefit. City of Raleigh v. Carolina Power &amp;

                            Commissioners' Duty. - This section does not impose on the commissioners the duty to personally work the streets, but it does impose on them a duty to keep them in repair. Although they are allowed discretion, the commissioners are subject to indictment
                            for neglecting to keep public streets in repair. State v. Dickson, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 871</cite>, 32 S.E. 961 (1899).

                            Negligent failure to take such measures as ordinary prudence requires to avert injury, where the municipality has actual or imputable knowledge of the dangerous condition, will render municipality liable for injury proximately caused. Hunt v. City of

                            Municipalities may be liable in tort for failure to maintain their streets in a reasonably safe condition, and they are now required to do so by this section. McClellan v.

                            Municipality Cannot Plead Governmental Immunity for Street Damage. - As an exception to the doctrine of governmental immunity, it has been uniformly held in this jurisdiction that municipalities may be held liable in tort for failure to maintain their
                            streets in a reasonably safe condition, and they are now required by statute to do so. Clark v. Scheld, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 732</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 838 (1961).

                        <p>
                            A municipality cannot, with impunity, create in its streets a condition palpably dangerous, neglect to provide the most ordinary means of protection against it, and then avoid liability for proximate injury on the plea of governmental immunity. Hunt v.
                            City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 74</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 694 (1946); Kaplan v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 203 S.E.2d 653, rev'd on other

                        <p>
                            No Governmental Immunity. - Municipalities in North Carolina have never been immune from civil liability for negligence based upon the failing to keep its streets free of unnecessary obstructions, as in untrimmed shrubs and bushes that obstructed the
                            view of motorists using the streets involved; therefore, in the case at bar defendant had no immunity to waive, and the insolvency of its insurer did not affect its liability. McDonald v. Village of Pinehurst,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 633, 372 S.E.2d 733 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's denial of the city's motion for summary judgment was affirmed because although the city contended that it was immune from suit under the doctrine of governmental immunity for the claims brought by the mother, and that it had not waived its
                            governmental immunity pursuant to G.S. 160A-485 because it had not purchased liability insurance covering the claims, the mother alleged that the city was negligent in violating G.S. 160A-296, which gave a municipality the
                            authority to regulate the use of its streets and sidewalks and, in addition, imposed a positive duty upon the municipality to keep them in proper repair, in a reasonably safe condition, and free from unnecessary obstructions.
                            G.S. 160A-296(a)(1), (2), and (5). The statute created an exception to the doctrine that a municipality will have immunity from liability for negligence in the performance of a governmental function, and, by reason thereof,
                            the doctrine of governmental immunity had no application to protect a city from liability for a negligent breach of the statutory duties so imposed; moreover, there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether or not
                            the city had actual or implied notice of the obstructions. Beckles-Palomares v. Logan, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 235, 688 S.E.2d 758 (2010).

                            Municipality Is Not Insurer of Condition of Streets. - While it is the duty of the city to keep its streets in such repair that they are reasonably safe for public travel, it is not an insurer of such condition, nor does it warrant that they shall at
                            all times be absolutely safe. A city is only responsible for a negligent breach of duty. Fitzgerald v. Concord, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 110</cite>, 52 S.E. 309 (1905).

                            Actual or Constructive Notice Prerequisite to Recovery. - Notice of a defect in a street, actual or constructive, and a failure to act on the part of the municipality to remedy the situation are prerequisites to recovery in an action involving a municipality.
                            Bowman v. Town of Granite Falls, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 333, 204 S.E.2d 239 (1974).

                        <p>
                            In order to establish responsibility, it is not sufficient to show that a defect existed and that an injury has been caused thereby. It must be further shown that the officers of the town knew, or by ordinary diligence might have discovered, the defect,
                            and that the character of the defect was such that injuries to travellers therefrom might reasonably be anticipated. Jones v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 310</cite>, 32 S.E.

                        <p>
                            It is necessary for a complaining party to show more than the existence of a defect in the street or sidewalk and the injury; he must also show that the officers of the town or city knew, or by ordinary diligence, might have known of the defect, and that
                            the character of the defect was such that injuries to travellers using its street or sidewalk in a proper manner might reasonably be foreseen. Mosseller v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 104</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Summary judgment was appropriate where the plaintiff failed to offer any evidence that the city had either actual or constructive notice of any alleged defect in its sidewalk, as required to support a negligence action under this section, so as to create
                            a genuine issue of material fact. Willis v. City of New Bern, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 762, 529 S.E.2d 691 (2000).

                            Notice Must Be of Defect Itself. - The notice, actual or implied, of a highway defect causing injuries which a municipality must receive as a condition precedent to liability for those injuries is notice of the defect itself which occasioned the injury,
                            and not merely of conditions naturally productive of that defect and subsequently in fact producing it. Mosseller v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 104</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 558 (1966).

                            When Notice Implied. - When observable defects in a highway have existed for a time so long that they ought to have been observed, notice of them is implied. Fitzgerald v. Concord, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 110</cite>,
                            52 S.E. 309 (1905).

                            Notice of a dangerous condition in a street or sidewalk will be imputed to a town or city if its officers should have discovered it in the exercise of due care. Faw v. Town of N. Wilkesboro, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 406</cite>,

                            Implied Notice Usually a Jury Question. - On the question of notice implied from the continued existence of a defect, no definite or fixed rule can be laid down as to the time required, and it is usually a question for the jury on the facts and circumstances
                            of each particular case. Fitzgerald v. Concord, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 110</cite>, 52 S.E. 309 (1905).

                            Notice of Latent Defects. - Notice of latent defects should not be so readily presumed from their continuance as open and obvious defects. Fitzgerald v. Concord, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 110</cite>, 52 S.E. 309 (1905).

                            Foreseeability of Injury Essential to Recovery. - To recover for injuries received from a fall on a defective street, the plaintiff must not only show that the city knew of the defect, but must go further and show that the character of the defect was
                            such that injuries to travellers using its street or sidewalk in a proper manner might reasonably be foreseen. Mosseller v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 104</cite>, 147 S.E.2d

                            Trivial Defects Will Not Make City Liable. - It is not every defect in a street or sidewalk which will render a city liable to a person who falls as a result thereof. Trivial defects, which are not naturally dangerous, will not make the city liable for
                            injuries occasioned thereby. Mosseller v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 104</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 558 (1966).

                            Effect of Independent Contributory Cause. - When two causes combine to produce an injury to a traveler on a highway, both of which are in their nature proximate, the one being a culpable defect in the highway, and the other some occurrence for which neither
                            party is responsible, the municipality is liable, provided the injury would not have been sustained but for such defect. Dillon v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 184</cite>, 32 S.E.
                            548 (1889).

                            Liability for Consequential Damage in Grading Streets. - Where a municipal corporation has authority to grade its streets, it is not liable for consequential damage, unless the work was done in an unskillful and incautious manner. Meares v. Commissioners

                            Liability for Damages from Tree Cutting. - Discretionary power of repairing and maintaining a street is vested in the commissioners of a city, and an action for damages caused by cutting of trees in the street, by them, will not lie in favor of an abutting
                            property owner, in the absence of negligence, malice, or wantonness. Tate v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 392</cite>, 19 S.E. 767 (1894).

                            Failure to Provide Reasonable Lighting. - While a city may not be under a legal necessity to light its streets at all, where it does maintain street lights its failure to provide lighting which is reasonably required at a particular place because of the
                            dangerous condition of the street is a negligent failure to discharge its duty to maintain the streets in a reasonably safe condition for travel. Hunt v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 74</cite>,
                            36 S.E.2d 694 (1946).

                            No Right in Abutting Owner to Change Street's Condition. - When a street is repaired or changed by a city so as to damage an owner of the fee in the street or to cause a nuisance, the owner has no right to change the condition of the street so as to remove
                            the nuisance or lessen the damage, and such act will subject him to indictment. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 865</cite>, 12 S.E. 320 (1890).

                            Ratification of Unauthorized Repair by City. - When an unauthorized person makes an act of repair to streets that might have been done by a city, a ratification by the city will relieve him of any liability as a trespasser. Wolfe v. Pearson,

                            Although court found that the maintenance of stop signs constituted a discretionary function, thereby entitling city to the defense of governmental immunity, it reversed the lower court's grant of summary judgment in the city's favor where it appeared
                            from the record that the city was covered by a liability insurance policy at the time of the collision at issue, thereby waiving immunity from suit. Cucina v.

                            Repair Does Not Prove Possession. - City's occasional repair of fence on Housing Authority property did not itself prove the city's intent to possess and control the fence, since these repairs might have reflected no more than the city's statutory duty
                            as a municipality to clear streets and rights-of-way. Petty v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 391, 355 S.E.2d 210 (1987), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                            559, 369 S.E.2d 612 (1988).

                            Suit against a city arising from a traffic accident during a funeral procession was properly dismissed because a moving car, even if driven negligently, was not an "obstruction" within the meaning of G.S. 160A-296(a)(2); also, the timing of a traffic
                            signal was a discretionary governmental function, and thus within the immunity doctrine. Sisk v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 645 S.E.2d 176 (2007), review

                            be jointly and severally liable to a traveler for an injury resulting therefrom absent fault on his part. The question of primary and secondary liability is for the offending parties to adjust between themselves. Dillon v.

                            The opening and closing of streets is a governmental function. Bessemer Imp. Co. v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 549</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 336 (1958).

                            The power provided by subdivision (a)(3) of this section is to be exercised in the discretion of the governing body of the municipality acting in its governmental, rather than its proprietary capacity. Rockingham Square Shopping Center, Inc. v. Town of

                            In an action by homeowners against a town alleging claims for inverse condemnation and negligence for closing a public street after storm damage under G.S. 160A-296(A), the trial court erred in failing to enter summary judgment in favor of the town on
                            governmental immunity grounds. The extent to which particular municipal streets and roads were kept open for use by members of the public was a governmental function and governmental immunity was available to the town as a
                            defense to the damage claims arising from a discretionary road closure decision. Kirkpatrick v. Town of Nags Head, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 132, 713 S.E.2d 151 (2011).

                            Exclusive to the Municipality. - A municipal corporation is usually given express power by its charter to lay out and open streets. Such charter provisions are supplemented by our general statutes. Under the power thus conferred, the municipal authorities
                            are the sole judges of the necessity or expediency of exercising that right. The municipality's power over its streets is exclusive. Waynesville v. Satterthwait, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 226</cite>,

                            Diminution of Access from Change of Grade Is Damnum Absque Injuria. - When a city acts for public convenience under the authority granted it by the legislature and raises or lowers the grade of a street, any diminution of access by an abutting property
                            owner is damnum absque injuria. The abutting property owner can neither prevent the change by injunction nor recover damages for the diminished value of his property, when the work is done in conformity with plans designated
                            to promote public convenience. Thompson v. Seaboard Air Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 577</cite>, 104 S.E.2d 181 (1958).

                            of the city commissioners, the width of the street and sidewalk being within the sound discretion of the commissioners. Ham v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 107</cite>, 170 S.E.

                            Demurrer to Action Challenging Closing of Street at Railroad Grade Crossing Upheld. - Defendant town, in cooperation with federal and State authorities in procuring the construction of an underpass and the elimination of two grade crossings, closed two
                            of its streets at the railroad crossings. An action was thereupon instituted by property holders adjacent to the railroad tracks and along one of the closed streets, alleging that the order closing the streets was ultra vires
                            and resulted in the creation of a nuisance causing injury to plaintiffs' property. It was held that defendant town had authority to close the said streets at the crossings in the interest of the public welfare, in the exercise
                            of a discretionary governmental power with which the courts could interfere only in instances of fraud or oppression constituting a manifest abuse of discretion, and that as the closing did not constitute a nuisance or abuse
                            of discretion, defendant town's demurrer to the complaint was properly sustained. Sanders v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 312</cite>, 4 S.E.2d 902 (1939).

                    <p>
                        Subsection (a) is intended to apply where there is no contract between a city and the Board of Transportation and does not, per se, absolve a city from liability for injury, if any, imposed upon it by such contract. Matternes v. City of Winston-Salem,

                        City Had No Duty to Regulate Design, Site Distance, or Speed Limit of a Street. - Trial court did not err in granting a town and municipal employees summary judgment in a driver's action alleging that they negligently failed to establish the proper road
                        design, speed limit, or traffic control devices on the street where the accident occurred because the driver failed to produce any evidence that the town and employees owed a legal duty to regulate the design, site distance, speed
                        limit, or any other features of the street, and there was no evidence that the view on the street where the accident occurred was obstructed; the driver was able to see a stop sign in time to stop at an intersection, and she failed
                        to produce any evidence of a defect in the condition of the street or any question about the adequacy of the stop sign to alert drivers of the need to stop. Blackwell v. Hatley, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite>                        208, 688 S.E.2d 742 (2010).

                        Liability of City to Individual User for Failure to Make Repairs, etc., Contracted for. - An individual user of a street which is part of the State highway system who sustains personal injuries or property damage as the result of a dangerous condition
                        of such street cannot maintain an action for damages against a city which contracted with the Board of Transportation to repair or remove such condition and then did nothing whatsoever about it. Matternes v. City of Winston-Salem,
                        <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 1</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 481 (1974).

                    <p>
                        Liability of City for Dangerous Condition on State Highway Within Its Borders. - When a city street becomes a part of the State highway system, the Board of Transportation is responsible for its maintenance thereafter, which responsibility includes the
                        control of all signs and structures within the right-of-way. Therefore, in the absence of any control over a State highway within its border, a municipality has no liability for injuries resulting from a dangerous condition of
                        such street, unless it created or increased such condition. Shapiro v. Toyota Motor Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 658, 248 S.E.2d 868 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Sidewalks. - Summary judgment should not have been granted to a city in a negligence case because it had a statutory duty to maintain a sidewalk in a reasonably safe manner; there was no evidence that the North Carolina Department of Transportation had
                        agreed to take on maintenance responsibility in this case. Although the city's responsibility to maintain certain streets and bridges was limited, the same was not true for its responsibility to maintain sidewalks. Steele v. City
                        of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 782 S.E.2d 331 (2016).

                        City Not Responsible for "Controlled Access" Areas. - All areas within the boundaries of the "controlled access" area are part of the State Highway system and were excepted from contract between the city and NCDOT; thus, city was not responsible for dangerous
                        conditions within the "controlled access" areas. Eakes v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 551, 481 S.E.2d 403 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Exercise of control over railroad crossings is within a municipality's inherent police power. Cooper v. Town of Southern Pines, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 293 S.E.2d 235 (1982).

                        Authority Under This Section Does Not Constitute Duty. - The fact that a city has the authority to make certain decisions does not mean that the city is under an obligation to do so. The words "authority" and "power" are not synonymous with the word "duty".
                        When the Legislature intended to create a duty in this Chapter, it did so expressly. Cooper v. Town of Southern Pines, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 293 S.E.2d 235 (1982).

                        In a wrongful death action arising from a motorist's death after being struck by a train at a railroad crossing in a city, the city's authority, under G.S. 160A-298(c), to require the installation of warning devices at the crossing did not create a duty
                        on its part to have such devices installed. Wilkerson v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 332, 566 S.E.2d 104 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Section allows a city to exercise its discretion in requiring improvements at railroad crossings. There is no mandate of action. Cooper v. Town of Southern Pines, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 293 S.E.2d 235 (1982).

                        Courts Will Not Interfere Absent Abuse of Discretion. - Courts will not interfere with discretionary powers conferred on a municipality for the public welfare unless the exercise (or non-exercise) of those powers is so clearly unreasonable as to constitute
                        an abuse of discretion. Cooper v. Town of Southern Pines, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 293 S.E.2d 235 (1982).

                        Cost of Automatic Signal Devices at Railroad Crossings. - A city has authority, in the exercise of its police power, to promote public safety and convenience, to allocate to a railway company some portion of the costs of the installation and maintenance
                        of automatic signal devices at road crossings. Allocations so made would constitute a denial of a railway company's constitutional right to substantive due process only if the proportion of the costs allocated to it was so unreasonable
                        as to constitute an arbitrary taking of its property. Southern Ry. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 465</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 396 (1969), decided under former G.S. 160-200.

                        and public hearing shall be prominently posted in at least two places along the street or alley. If the street or alley is under the authority and control of the Department of Transportation, a copy of the resolution shall be mailed

                        it is located would thereby be deprived of reasonable means of ingress and egress to his property, the council may adopt an order closing the street or alley. A certified copy of the order (or judgment of the court) shall be filed

                        Closing of Portion of Street. - The legislature did not intend to provide a town with the authority to close a street only if the entire length and breadth of the street is closed; thus, a town may close only a portion of a street. Williamson v. Town
                        of Surf City, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 545 S.E.2d 798 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Time to Contest Closing of Street. - A declaratory judgment action to contest the validity of a proceeding to close a 30-foot wide strip of land adjacent to the plaintiff's property was untimely where the complaint was filed more than 30 days after the
                        adoption of the ordinance purporting to close the disputed strip of land. Groves v. Cmty. Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 548 S.E.2d 535 (2001).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Public Must Acquire Some Right in Street Before Municipality May Close It. - The language of subsections (a) and (d) clearly indicates that the public must have acquired some right in the street or alley before the municipality may act to close it. In
                        re Easement of Right of Way, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 303, 368 S.E.2d 639 (1988).

                        Indexing of resolution closing a street under the name of the city, without also indexing it under the names of the abutting landowners who acquired the fee simple title to the portion closed, was all that was statutorily required. General Greene Inv.
                        Co. v. Greene, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 268 S.E.2d 810, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 235</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 132 (1980).

                    <p>
                        Street Not to Be Utilized for Park. - Subsection (c) specifies that if a portion of the street is closed, the land would go to property owners on either side of the dedicated street; thus, closing a street pursuant to this section would not allow town
                        to utilize the street for park purposes. Wooten v. Town of Topsail Beach, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 739, 493 S.E.2d 285 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 78</cite>, 505

                    <p>
                        Construction of Public Facilities on Portion of Closed Street. - A town had authority to close a street pursuant to this section where the town intended to use a portion of the closed street to construct public facilities, provided the town complied with
                        the procedural requirements of this section. Williamson v. Town of Surf City, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 545 S.E.2d 798 (2001).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Collateral Attack on Notice Precluded. - Where all abutting owners consented to a closing, no other notices by mail to landowners were required by former G.S. 153-9(17), and subsequent owners of property who purchased on the representation that an adjacent
                        street was open could not collaterally attack the city council's finding that notice of the hearing was duly published. General Greene Inv. Co. v. Greene, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 268
                        S.E.2d 810, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 235</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 132 (1980).

                    <p>
                        Separation of Powers Clause not Violated. - G.S. 160A-299(b) did not deprive a home owner of his right to a fair hearing or violate the Separation of Powers Clause of the North Carolina Constitution in his appeal from a town council order closing a road
                        because he had the opportunity to test, rebut, and explain evidence presented to the council at three public hearings held on the road closure over a two-month period; these hearings were the proper place for him to present evidence
                        and to rebut any evidence contrary to his position. Houston v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 739, 630 S.E.2d 249 (2006).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Status as Taxpayer Insufficient to Support Appeal. - Resident provided no factual basis to support the argument that the resident was an aggrieved person in this case as the resident's property was not adjacent to certain streets, the resident did not
                        allege any personal injury, and although the resident asserted the resident's status as a taxpayer, such status is patently insufficient to support an appeal from, or action for declaratory judgment regarding, a town's order closing
                        a street or alley under the statute; thus, the resident lacked standing to contest the town's decision. Cox v. Town of Oriental, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 675, 759 S.E.2d 388 (2014).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidentiary Hearing Not Required on Appeal. - Homeowner was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing in his appeal from a town council's road closure order because the clear and unambiguous language of G.S. 160A-299(b) directed the superior court to decide
                        all issues except the council's compliance with procedural issues on the record before the town council, and the owner did not challenge the council's procedural compliance; the record evidence supported the council's findings,
                        and the superior court properly affirmed its order after finding that it complied with G.S. 160A-299. Houston v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 739, 630 S.E.2d 249 (2006).

                        City has been held to have owed the plaintiffs no affirmative duty to control traffic on a city street when G.S. 160A-300 authorized the city to control traffic, but did not expressly require it to do so; a city cannot be held liable for delaying the
                        installation of safety devices at a railroad crossing because the city, although authorized to require safety devices, has no duty to have the warning or safety devices in place. Norman v. N.C. DOT,

                        Installation and Maintenance of Traffic Lights as Discretionary Governmental Function. - The installation and maintenance of traffic lights by a municipality is in the interest of the public safety in the exercise of the police power and is a discretionary
                        governmental function. Hodges v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 737</cite>, 200 S.E. 889 (1939).

       </b> - An individual who was assessed a $50.00 civil penalty for a red light violation detected by cameras installed under the authority of G.S. 160A-300.1 lacked standing to challenge the statute on the grounds of a violation
                        of his right to due process and equal protection because the individual did not avail himself of any of the procedural processes available under the statute. Furthermore, even if the individual had standing, the statute was civil
                        in nature and the process was sufficient in a civil setting to afford the citation recipient due process. In addition, the individual failed to allege membership in any suspect class. Shavitz v. City of High Point, 270 F. Supp.

                        A municipality may require a motorist who parks his vehicle in a parking meter zone to set the meter in operation by depositing a coin, provided that the deposit of the coin is the method selected by its governing body in the exercise of its discretion
                        for the purpose of regulating parking in the interest of the public convenience and not as a revenue raising measure. State v. Scoggin, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 1</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 97 (1952).

                        The deposit of a coin by a motorist at the time of parking, to activate the parking meter, is not a fee, charge or toll for using the parking space, but is simply the method adopted by the governing authorities of the city for putting the meter in operation,
                        and the revenue derived therefrom is expressly set apart and dedicated to a particular use by the legislature. Britt v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 446</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 289 (1952).

                        But Revenue Derived Therefrom Is in the Nature of a Tax. - The revenue derived from on-street parking facilities is exacted in the performance of a governmental function, and must be set apart and used for a specific purpose. By whatever name called,
                        it is in the nature of a tax. Britt v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 446</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 289 (1952).

                    <p>
                        Validity of Making Parking Privilege Dependent on Amount of Money Placed in Meter. - Where a municipal ordinance prescribed that parking in a designated zone should be limited to one hour, a motorist could not be convicted of overtime parking for parking
                        in such zone for less than the prescribed one-hour period; hence, an additional provision of the ordinance, that a motorist would be subject to criminal prosecution if he parked in the one-hour zone for longer than 12 minutes upon
                        the deposit of a one-cent coin or 24 minutes upon the deposit of two one-cent coins for successive periods, was unconstitutional as being discriminatory and as making the period of time dependent not upon public convenience but
                        upon the amount of money deposited. State v. Scoggin, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 1</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 97 (1952).

                        Where a municipal ordinance prescribes one-hour and two-hour parking meter zones upon the deposit of a five-cent coin, the ordinance may permit, by nonpenal provisions, that a motorist may deposit a one-cent coin for a shorter length of time, provided
                        the motorist is permitted, by depositing additional pennies, not to exceed a total of five, to remain in the parking space for the total length of time prescribed by the ordinance for such zone. State v. Scoggin,

                        Contract Binding City to Enact Parking Meter Ordinance Not Authorized. - A municipality may not bind itself to enact or enforce on-street and off-street parking regulations by penal ordinance for the period during which bonds issued to provide off-street
                        parking facilities should be outstanding, since it may not contract away or bind itself in regard to its freedom to enact governmental regulations. Britt v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 446</cite>,

                        Zoning amendment, which addressed the number of vehicles that could be parked on a private lot, did not address the same subject as G.S. 160A-301, which governed ordinary parking on public vehicular areas; therefore, G.S. 160A-301 is not a more "specific"
                        statute that renders the provisions of G.S. 160A-4 inapplicable because it simply addresses a different subject. Patmore v. Town of Chapel Hill N.C. <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 757 S.E.2d

                        Zoning Amendment and Statute Did Not Address Same Subject. - Fact that a town chose to restrict the number of cars parked on a lawn as a rough proxy for the number of tenants did not transform a zoning amendment into a "parking" ordinance because the
                        amendment was intended to regulate the ratio of bedrooms to tenants in rental properties by restricting the number of vehicles parked in the yard; the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius was not applicable to the
                        relationship between the statute and the zoning amendment. Patmore v. Town of Chapel Hill N.C. <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 757 S.E.2d 302, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 519</cite>,

                    or regulate fishing from any bridge one mile beyond the corporate limits of the city where the board or boards of county commissioners by resolution agree to such prohibition or regulation; provided, however, that the board or boards
                    of county commissioners may upon 30 days' written notice withdraw their respective approval of the municipal ordinance, and that ordinance shall have no further effect within that county's jurisdiction. The ordinance shall provide
                    that signs shall be posted on any bridge where fishing is prohibited or regulated reflecting such prohibition or regulation. In any event, no one may fish from the drawspan of any regularly attended drawbridge.

                <p>
                    The police department of the city is hereby vested with the jurisdiction and authority to enforce any ordinance passed pursuant to this section.

                    The authority granted under the provisions of this section shall be subject to the authority of the Board of Transportation to prohibit fishing on any bridge on the State highway system.

                        A city may by ordinance license and regulate all vehicles operated for hire in the city. The ordinance may require that the drivers and operators of taxicabs engaged in the business of transporting passengers for hire over the public streets shall obtain
                        a license or permit from the city; provided, however, that the license or permit fee for taxicab drivers shall not exceed fifteen dollars ($15.00). As a condition of licensure, the city may require an applicant for licensure to
                        pass a controlled substance examination. The ordinances may also specify the types of taxicab services that are legal in the municipality; provided, that in all cases shared-ride services as well as exclusive-ride services shall
                        be legal. Shared-ride service is defined as a taxi service in which two or more persons with either different origins or with different destinations, or both, occupy a taxicab at one time. Exclusive-ride service is defined as a
                        taxi service in which the first passenger or party requests exclusive use of the taxicab. In the event the applicant is to be subjected to a national criminal history background check, the ordinance shall specifically authorize
                        the use of FBI records. The ordinance shall require any applicant who is subjected to a national criminal history background check to be fingerprinted.

                        The word "franchise" denotes a right or privilege conferred by law, that is, a special privilege conferred by government on an individual, natural or corporate, which is not enjoyed by its citizens generally, of common right. Ordinarily the grant of a
                        franchise when accepted and acted on creates a contract which is binding on the grantor and the grantee. Hence, the grant of a franchise contemplates, and usually embraces, express conditions and stipulations as to standards of
                        service, and so forth, which the grantee or holder of the franchise must perform. Victory Cab Co. v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 572</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 433 (1951).

                        Ordinance Regulating Taxicabs Presumed to Be Valid. - In the exercise of their delegated power to license, regulate, and control the operators and drivers of taxicabs, it is the duty of the municipal authorities, in their sound discretion, to determine
                        what ordinances or regulations are reasonably necessary for the protection of the public or the better government of the town; and when in the exercise of such discretion and ordinance is adopted, it is presumed to be valid, and
                        the courts will not declare it invalid unless it is clearly shown to be so. State v. Stallings, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 252</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 901 (1949); Victory Cab Co. v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 138</cite>,

                        Requiring Taxicab Drivers to Wear Distinctive Insignia. - It is not an unlawful, unreasonable, or arbitrary exercise of its delegated police power for a city to require, as a condition incident to the privilege of operating a taxicab on its streets, that
                        the driver of such taxicab shall wear a distinctive cap or other insignia while operating same, to show that he is a duly licensed taxicab driver. Such a requirement would seem to be reasonable and a protection to the public against
                        unlicensed drivers or operators. State v. Stallings, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 252</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 901 (1949).

                        Requiring Taxicab Operators to Secure Liability Insurance. - An ordinance requiring operators of taxicabs or other motor vehicles for hire to secure liability insurance or enter into bond with personal or corporate surety is a valid exercise of the police
                        power and does not violate the U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, the operation of vehicles for gain being a special and extraordinary use of a city's streets, which the city has the power to condition by ordinance uniform upon all coming
                        within the classification. Watkins v. Iseley, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 256</cite>, 183 S.E. 365 (1936).

                    A city may only require street improvements related to schools that are required for safe ingress and egress to the municipal street system and that are physically connected to a driveway on the school site. The required improvements shall not exceed
                    those required pursuant to G.S. 136-18(29). G.S. 160A-307 shall not apply to schools. A city may only require street improvements related to schools as provided in G.S. 160A-372. The cost of any improvements to the municipal street
                    system pursuant to this section shall be reimbursed by the city. Any agreement between a school and a city to make improvements to the municipal street system shall not include a requirement for acquisition of right-of-way by the school,
                    unless the school is owned by an entity that has eminent domain power. Any right-of-way costs incurred by a school for required improvements pursuant to this section shall be reimbursed by the city. Notwithstanding any provision of
                    this Chapter to the contrary, a city may not condition the approval of any zoning, rezoning, or permit request on the waiver or reduction of any provision of this section. The term "school," as used in this section, means any facility
                    engaged in the educational instruction of children in any grade or combination of grades from kindergarten through the twelfth grade at which attendance satisfies the compulsory attendance law and includes charter schools authorized
                    under G.S. 115C-218.5.

        Authority to Impose Impact and Tap Fees.

                        160A-314(a) makes no distinction between increasing rates, rents, or fees in order to raise the money necessary for capital improvements, and there is no language in the statute limiting a town's authority to impose fees for the
                        use of the services as a method of raising money for capital expansion or requiring that a town only increase rates for the services furnished to fund such improvements; thus, under G.S. 160A-314 the Town could increase fees, rates

                        While there may be authority for a city to purchase all of the stock of a corporation which owns and operates a water and sewer system, there is no authority to operate and continue the existence of a private for-profit corporation which is outside of
                        the traditional functions of a municipality and for which there is no judicial or legislative approval. See opinion of the Attorney General to H. Michael Boyd, Deputy City Attorney, City of Charlotte, 60 N.C.A.G. 114 (1992).

         Section Contemplates Anticompetitive Activity.
        </b> - This section grants cities the authority to acquire, construct, maintain, improve, own, operate, and regulate sewage collection systems of all types, and additionally, the North Carolina scheme explicitly contemplates
                            anticompetitive activity because it expressly authorizes cities to require those within its limits to use its sewer facilities. Therefore, the North Carolina legislature contemplated anticompetitive conduct by cities respecting
                            sewage services within city limits. Pinehurst Enters., Inc. v. Town of S. Pines, 690 F. Supp. 444 (M.D.N.C. 1988), aff'd, 887 F.2d 1080 (4th Cir. 1989).

                            distribution system, even in the absence of a concrete, immediate plan to furnish gas services to its citizens as the acquisition was for a public use by the city in compliance with G.S. 160A-240.1 and

                            acts merely as an agent of the General Assembly. City of Wilson v. Carolina Bldrs. of Wilson, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 117, 379 S.E.2d 712 (1989).

                            Rates Charged for Garbage Service. - A municipality which provides garbage collection services may impose a charge reasonably commensurate with the cost of this service upon the householder or building occupant. Under proper classification, the rates
                            charged need not be uniform, and a business may be charged at a rate different from individuals. Big Bear of N.C. Inc. v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 262</cite>, 240 S.E.2d

                            County Zoning Ordinances Inapplicable to Municipal Facility. - City which owned a sewage treatment facility located in a county and outside the city's boundaries was not required to comply with county's zoning ordinances in upgrading the facility and
                            providing sewage service to newly annexed areas of city with that facility. Davidson County v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 354 S.E.2d 280, modified and aff'd,

                            special use permit, with a condition attached to the permit requiring the county's prior approval of service to county citizens, to meet its statutory mandate to provide sewer service to residents in newly annexed areas without

                            Municipality Is Not Liable for Personal Injuries Resulting from Construction of Sewerage System. - A municipal corporation is performing a governmental function when engaged in construction of a sewerage system and is not liable for personal injuries
                            resulting from the alleged negligent acts of its employees in such construction, notwithstanding the municipality charges for sewage and sanitary services which it furnishes its citizens. A municipality will not lose its governmental
                            immunity solely because it is engaged in an activity which makes a profit, the test being whether the act is for the common good of all without the element of special corporate benefit or pecuniary profit. McCombs v. City of

                            Municipality's for Injuries to Health Resulting from Sewer Construction and Maintenance. - In the construction and maintenance of a sewer or drainage system, a municipal corporation exercises a part of the governmental powers of the State for the customary
                            local convenience and benefit of all the people, and in the exercise of these discretionary functions the municipality cannot be required to respond in damages to individuals for injury to health, resulting either from omissions
                            to act or the mode of exercising the power conferred on it for public purposes to be used at discretion for the public good. McCombs v. City of Asheboro, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite>                            234, 170 S.E.2d 169 (1969).

                            Municipality May Be Liable for Damages to Property. - In actions brought to recover damages for injury to property and person by reason of the alleged negligent maintenance of a sewerage system, recovery has been allowed for damage to property on the
                            theory of the creation of a nuisance and the taking of property. McCombs v. City of Asheboro, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 170 S.E.2d 169 (1969).

                            in damages therefor or subject to equitable restraint in a proper case, and it is a nuisance to pollute a stream by emptying sewage therein. Moser v. City of Burlington, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. 141</cite>,

                            Sewer Excavations Not Attractive Nuisance. - Municipalities must build sewers and other conduits necessitating the making of excavations. This creates some obvious danger, but is not categorized as an attractive nuisance. McCombs v. City of Asheboro,

                            Town Had No Authority to Impose Impact Fees. - Water and sewer "impact fee" ordinances were invalid because the Public Enterprise Statutes failed to empower the town to impose impact fees for future services; the enabling statutes clearly and unambiguously
                            empowered the town to charge for the contemporaneous use of water and sewer services, not to collect fees for future discretionary spending, and because the legislature alone controlled the extension of municipal authority,
                            the ordinances exceeded the powers delegated to the town. Quality Built Homes, Inc. v. Town of Carthage, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 15</cite>, 789 S.E.2d 454 (2016).

                            and subversive as to amount to an abuse rather than a legitimate exercise of the legislative power. Stroupe v. Eller, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 573</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 240 (1964).

                            Utilities Had Standing to Challenge City's Provision of Water to Subdivision. - Plaintiff utilities which, by virtue of their contiguity to subdivision were in a superior position to any other utility in the area to provide service to the development
                            since no other competitor would be able to provide for subdivision without first obtaining a certificate, and in the event that another company sought a certificate, plaintiffs would be afforded the opportunity to contest the
                            application, had a legitimate expectation of entitlement sufficient to give them a protectible interest so as to challenge city's provision of water to the subdivision. Quality Water Supply, Inc. v. City of Wilmington,

                            Annexation of Area Served by Private Water or Sewer Lines. - Where there is no contract or municipal ordinance involved, and the territory served by private water or sewer lines is annexed to a municipality, the owner of the lines may not recover the
                            value thereof from the municipality unless it appropriates them and controls them as proprietor. Covington v. City of Rockingham, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 507</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 420 (1966).

                            Town Authorized to Extend Water Lines. - When the water service being provided by plaintiff water service to annexed area was no longer equal to the water service being provided by the town to other areas within the municipal boundaries, the town had
                            the authority, pursuant to this section, to extend its water lines to the annexed area. Carolina Water Serv., Inc. v. Town of Atlantic Beach, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 464 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            By offering water users in annexed area with the option, rather than requirement, to connect to the town's water system at reduced fees, the town was simply providing those users with the same opportunity as it had historically given to water users in
                            other areas to which it had extended service. Carolina Water Serv., Inc. v. Town of Atlantic Beach, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 464 S.E.2d 317 (1995).

                            City Authorized to Expand Sewer System. - A condemnation procedure was proper because the intended use of the condemnation satisfied the public use and public benefit test as all city residents, including the landowners whose property was being condemned,
                            and provided an equal right to connect to the expanded sewer system, which was an essential service. Tucker v. City of Kannapolis, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 582 S.E.2d 697 (2003).

                            The clause "Subject to Part 2 of this Article" refers to those situations where a city extending its electric lines outside its corporate limits necessarily begins construction within its corporate limits. When a city extending service outside its corporate
                            limits constructs lines beginning at some point within its corporate limits, then pursuant to this section and G.S. 160A-332, such lines as are within the city limits may not infringe on the guaranteed corridor rights of a
                            secondary supplier. Duke Power Co. v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 378, 317 S.E.2d 701, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 82</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 895 (1984).

                        <p>
                            Under current legislation, the absolute right of a secondary supplier to serve customers within its 300-foot corridor arises upon the effective date of annexation, statutorily defined as the "determination date." If the legislature determines that the
                            corridor rights of a secondary supplier deserve protection before the effective date of annexation, then it can guarantee such rights by defining the "determination date" when such rights arise as the date an annexation ordinance
                            is adopted rather than the date an annexation plan is effected. Unless and until such time arises, the Supreme Court precedent in relying solely on this section in determining whether a city has legislative authority to extend
                            its lines will be followed. Duke Power Co. v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 378, 317 S.E.2d 701, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 82</cite>, 321 S.E.2d

                            Right to Distribute Electricity Beyond Corporate Limits. - A municipality has the power to purchase, generate, or distribute electricity for its own use and the use of its inhabitants, and is given legislative authority to extend its lines beyond its
                            corporate limits for the purpose of selling electricity to nonresidents; therefore, a complaint in an action against a municipality alleging injury from negligent maintenance of power lines outside the corporate limits was
                            not demurrable on the ground that the alleged negligence of its officers and employees was ultra vires. Kennerly v. Town of Dallas, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 532</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 538 (1939).

                            A municipal corporation engaged in the production and distribution of electric power is authorized to extend this service to consumers outside its corporate limits, and this would confer authority on a city to construct and operate transmission lines
                            for the distribution of electric current for the benefit of the public beyond its corporate boundaries within reasonable limitations. But if from lawful competition the town's business is curtailed, it would seem that no actionable
                            wrong would result, nor would the town be entitled to injunctive relief therefrom. Town of Grimesland v. City of Washington, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 117</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 794 (1951).

                            does not empower or authorize municipalities to operate electric systems outside corporate limits, nor does it restrict such service. Insofar as the General Statutes are concerned, the sole authority for, and the only restriction
                            upon municipalities furnishing electric service outside corporate limits is found in this section. Lumbee River Elec. Membership Corp. v. City of Fayetteville, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 726</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 209 (1983).

                            Municipalities have legislative permission to extend their sewer and water lines beyond corporate boundaries. Such extensions may be made either because necessary to the effective operation of the improvement within the city, or to provide services for
                            a profit beyond the corporate limits. Eakley v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 683</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 777 (1960).

                            Extension of Water and Sewer Facilities for Profit Requires Vote. - A municipality has the power to extend funds for the construction and operation of water and sewer facilities without a vote when such facilities are for the benefit of the citizens of
                            the municipality, but extension of such facilities outside its corporate limits for the purpose of profit is a proprietary function requiring a vote of its citizens. Eakley v. City of Raleigh,

                            Right to Impose Conditions on Furnishing Water and Sewer Service Outside Corporate Limits. - Since it is optional with the city as to whether or not it will furnish water to residents outside its corporate limits and permit such residents to connect their
                            sewer facilities with the sewerage system of the city, or with any other sewerage system which connects with the city system, it may fix the terms upon which the service may be rendered and its facilities used. George v. City

                            A municipality which operates its own waterworks is under no duty in the first instance to furnish water to persons outside its limits. It has the discretionary power, however, to engage in this undertaking. When a municipality exercises this discretionary
                            power, it does not assume the obligations of a public service corporation toward nonresident consumers. It retains the authority to specify the terms upon which nonresidents may obtain its water. Fulghum v. Town of Selma,

                            Duty of Equal Service in Furnishing Water Owed Only to Consumers within Corporate Limits. - When a municipality engages in supplying water to its inhabitants, it owes the duty of equal service in furnishing water only to consumers within its corporate
                            limits. Fulghum v. Town of Selma, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 100</cite>, 76 S.E.2d 368 (1953).

                            The factors used to ascertain whether an extension of service is reasonable are the electric providers' current levels of service in the area in question, particularly in the immediate vicinity of the potential customer, and the present readiness, willingness,
                            and ability of each to serve the potential customer. South River Elec. Membership Corp. v. City of Fayetteville, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 401, 438 S.E.2d 464, cert. denied,

                            non-residents similarly situated who received sewerage service. Further, the town had the legal right to condition continued service to plaintiff's facility on the voluntary annexation of the facility into the town's corporate

                            distribution facility did not require any approval since the city and the land were located in the same county; moreover, the evidence showed that the real and substantial benefits of the condemnation accrued to the city in

        Town had authority to impose impact and tap fees
       </b> under this section and G.S. 160A-314(a). South Shell Inv. v. Town of Wrightsville Beach, 703 F. Supp. 1192 (E.D.N.C. 1988), aff'd, 900 F.2d 255 (4th Cir. 1990).

                        Town of Wrightsville Beach had the authority to impose utility system impact fees and tap fees for water and sewer services under the public enterprise statute and no specific enabling legislation was necessary; section 160A-314(a) makes no distinction
                        between increasing rates, rents, or fees in order to raise the money necessary for capital improvements, and there is no language in the statute limiting a town's authority to impose fees for the use of the services as a method
                        of raising money for capital expansion or requiring that a town only increase rates for the services furnished to fund such improvements; thus, under G.S. 160A-313 the town could increase fees, rates or both to raise money needed.

                        Town Had No Authority to Impose Impact Fees. - Water and sewer "impact fee" ordinances were invalid because the Public Enterprise Statutes failed to empower the town to impose impact fees for future services; the enabling statutes clearly and unambiguously
                        empowered the town to charge for the contemporaneous use of water and sewer services, not to collect fees for future discretionary spending, and because the legislature alone controlled the extension of municipal authority, the
                        ordinances exceeded the powers delegated to the town. Quality Built Homes, Inc. v. Town of Carthage, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 15</cite>, 789 S.E.2d 454 (2016).

                </p>
                <p>
                    (6) For all airports other than those covered by the exemption in subdivision (5) of this subsection, a city shall list separately the amount of a stormwater utility fee levied on airport runways and taxiways from the amount levied on the remainder of
                    the airport property. An airport shall be exempt from paying a stormwater utility fee levied on its runways and taxiways. To qualify for an exemption under this subdivision, an airport shall use the amount of savings realized from
                    this exemption for attracting business to the airport and shall provide certification to the city that the savings realized shall be used for this purpose. Except as otherwise prohibited under federal law, and upon request, an airport
                    shall provide the levying city with evidence that the full amount of savings realized from the exemption authorized under this subdivision has been used or encumbered for the purpose set forth in this subdivision. Any amount of savings
                    realized from the exemption authorized under this subdivision that is not used or encumbered for the purpose set forth in this subdivision shall be remitted to the city to be used in accordance with applicable law governing the use
                    of stormwater utility fee proceeds. Savings realized from the exemption authorized under this subdivision shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any local funding provided by the city to the airport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This subsection applies only to the Cities of Creedmoor, Durham and Winston-Salem, the Towns of Butner, Garner, Kernersville, Knightdale, Morrisville, Stem, Wendell, and Zebulon, and the Village of Clemmons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city shall adopt an appeals process providing notice and an opportunity to be heard in protest of the imposition of such liens. The county tax office, once notified of the city's lien, shall include the lien amount on any tax bills printed subsequent
                    to the notification. The county tax office shall add or remove liens from the tax bill at the request of the city (such as in the case of an appeal where the city decides to cancel the lien).

                        Sewerage Charge Is Not in the Nature of a Tax. - A properly adopted ordinance of a municipality establishing a sewerage service charge is not in the nature of a tax for the use of the users' sewer facilities, but a charge for the use of the sewer facilities
                        of the municipality in the disposal of polluted water and sewage which drains into the disposal system of the municipality. Covington v. City of Rockingham, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 507</cite>, 146

                        Setting of Rates for Water and Sewerage as Proprietary Function. - Setting of rates and charges for water and sewer services furnished by a municipality to its customers is a proprietary function, subject only to limitations imposed upon such action by
                        statute or contractual obligation assumed in such actions. Town of Spring Hope v. Bissette, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 210, 280 S.E.2d 490 (1981), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 248</cite>,

                        Town Had No Authority to Impose Impact Fees. - Water and sewer "impact fee" ordinances were invalid because the Public Enterprise Statutes failed to empower the town to impose impact fees for future services; the enabling statutes clearly and unambiguously
                        empowered the town to charge for the contemporaneous use of water and sewer services, not to collect fees for future discretionary spending, and because the legislature alone controlled the extension of municipal authority, the
                        ordinances exceeded the powers delegated to the town. Quality Built Homes, Inc. v. Town of Carthage, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 15</cite>, 789 S.E.2d 454 (2016).

                        Reclassification of Services. - Trial court erred in finding that a reclassification and concurrent change in billing methodology for water and sewer services at a retirement facility were arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and unreasonably discriminatory
                        because the statutory three-year statute of limitations barred the facility owner's complaint where, while the owner submitted a number of cases on the continuing wrong doctrine and the trial court appeared to have applied it,
                        there was not a continuing violation, occasioned by continual unlawful acts, but rather only continual ill effects from an original violation, the reclassification of the water meters; the monthly bills constituted the continual
                        ill effects from that reclassification. ACTS Retirement-Life Cmtys., Inc. v. Town of Columbus, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 456, 789 S.E.2d 527 (2016), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 694</cite>,

                        Since this section expressly authorizes a city to base its stormwater utility (SWU) fees on the impervious area of a piece of property, the rate scheme enacted by the City of Durham pursuant to its SWU ordinance was rationally related to the amount of
                        runoff from each lot and was not an arbitrary exercise of the city's statutory authority. Smith Chapel Baptist Church v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 805</cite>, 517 S.E.2d 874 (1999) (decided

                        City's Stormwater Management Program Exceeded Statutory Authority. - Durham city ordinance, designed to satisfy the EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System's permit requirements required by the Water Quality Act's demands for pollution control
                        of stormwater discharges into public waters, and fees thereunder, exceeded its enabling authority as laid out by G.S. 160A-311 and subsection (a1) of this section. Smith Chapel Baptist Church v. City of Durham,

                        Charge of Stormwater Fees Did Not Give Rise to Duty to Maintain Private Pipes. - Business owners failed to present sufficient evidence that a city had a duty to maintain the owners' pipes and drainage system underneath their parking lot or that any actions
                        by the city were the proximate cause of sinkholes that opened in the owners' parking lots. Nor did the city have a duty to maintain the owners' private pipes as a result of stormwater management fees that it charged the public.

                        Town of Wrightsville Beach had the authority to impose utility system impact fees and tap fees for water and sewer services under the public enterprise statute and no specific enabling legislation was necessary; this section makes no distinction between
                        increasing rates, rents, or fees in order to raise the money necessary for capital improvements, and there is no language in the statute limiting a town's authority to impose fees for the use of the services as a method of raising
                        money for capital expansion or requiring that a town only increase rates for the services furnished to fund such improvements; thus, under this section the town could increase fees, rates or both to raise money needed. South Shell

                        Contractor Lacked Standing to Contest City's Reimbursement Policy. - Solid waste contractor had no standing to claim a city's policy of reimbursing certain waste collection fees paid by apartment complexes using the city's preferred contractor was discriminatory
                        because (1) the complaining contractor was not a customer of the city's public enterprise services, (2) the anti-discrimination principle embodied in G.S. 160A-314 protected only customers of public enterprise services, not service
                        providers, and (3) the complaining contractor's ultimate argument that the city treated similarly situated apartment complexes differently by paying for fees for complexes who hired the preferred contractor and not those who hired
                        another provider did not pertain to the complaining contractor, as that contractor was not assessed the fees at issue, nor was the complaining contractor a customer for whom the city provided solid waste services. Cedar Greene,

                        because (1) the complex was a customer under the public enterprise statute at issue, (2) the complex demonstrated an immediate or threatened injury by the city's actions, as, construing the complex's allegations as true, due to
                        the city's policy of reimbursing only the city's preferred contractor for disposal of certain solid waste collected from multi-family complexes, the complex was faced with the choice of either losing the benefit of part of the
                        disposal fee the complex paid to the city each year for disposing of all solid waste collected from the complex and, in effect, paying twice for such disposal if the complex hired another contractor for supplemental waste collection,
                        or accepting supplemental collection rates charged by the preferred contractor, which were higher than those of the other contractor, thereby preventing the complex from obtaining monetary savings in the collection and disposal
                        of the complex's supplemental solid waste, and (3) the fact that the complex had not already suffered either alleged monetary loss was inapposite for standing purposes, since a showing of immediate or threatened injury sufficed
                        for purposes of standing. Cedar Greene, LLC v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 731 S.E.2d 193 (2012).

                        contractor, but not when a complex used a different contractor, was not discriminatory, in violation of G.S. 160A-314, because (1) the policy forced no complex to contract with the preferred contractor, (2) the city charged all
                        complexes the same fee, (3) that fee gave all complexes an equal chance to receive the same city service, and (4) a difference in waste collection costs complained about by a certain complex was solely due to the complex's choice

                        Rates Charged Consumers Outside Corporate Limits Held Not Discriminatory. - An amendment to an ordinance which substantially increased the rates charged for water supplied by a municipality for consumption outside its corporate limits could not be held
                        discriminatory in a legal sense when it applied alike to all nonresidents, and it was immaterial that a nonresident consumer deemed such rates exorbitant or unreasonable. Fulghum v. Town of Selma,

                        Minimum Monthly Charge Assessed Against Condominium Complex Held Reasonable. - For a municipal water supplier to charge a condominium complex based only on the size of the service line rather than on the number of residential units in the complex would
                        unfairly discriminate against single residential customers because it would place an unfair portion of the costs of water service on them. Accordingly, a minimum monthly charge assessed condominium complexes is neither discriminatory
                        nor arbitrary, but is reasonable. Bogue Shores Homeowners Ass'n v. Town of Atl. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. App.</cite> 549, 428 S.E.2d 258 (1993), pet. disc. rev. denied, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 162</cite>,

                        fees upon the wrong criteria (residence rather than kind and degree of service) in violation of this section. Therefore, the county could not enforce the ordinance against city which operated a sanitary landfill in the county.

        Authority to Impose Impact and Tap Fees.
       </b> - Town of Wrightsville Beach had the authority to impose utility system impact fees and tap fees for water and sewer services under the public enterprise statute and no specific enabling legislation was necessary; G.S.
                        160A-314(a) makes no distinction between increasing rates, rents, or fees in order to raise the money necessary for capital improvements, and there is no language in the statute limiting a town's authority to impose fees for the
                        use of the services as a method of raising money for capital expansion or requiring that a town only increase rates for the services furnished to fund such improvements; thus, under G.S. 160A-314 the town could increase fees, rates
                        or both to raise money needed. South Shell Inv. v. Town of Wrightsville Beach, 703 F. Supp. 1192 (E.D.N.C. 1988), aff'd, 900 F.2d 255 (4th Cir. 1990).

                        Every town has the power to grant franchises to public utilities, that is, the right to engage within the corporate boundaries in business of a public nature. Duke Power Co. v. Blue Ridge Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 596</cite>,
                        117 S.E.2d 812 (1961).

                        Grant of Franchise is Governmental Function. - In the granting of a franchise to a public utility to operate a system for furnishing gas for cooking and heating to residents of the municipality, the municipality exercises a governmental function, and
                        may not be held liable in tort to a person injured by a gas explosion, even if it be conceded that the city was negligent in continuing the franchise after the pipelines and equipment of the licensee had become defective. Denning

                        Grant or Refusal of Franchise Vested Solely in Governing Body. - The power to grant or to refuse to grant a franchise is vested solely in the governing body of the city; this power is essentially legislative in nature, and its exercise is discretionary.

                        The sovereign right to franchise implies the power to control for public benefit, including among other things, the right to fix reasonable rates and to specify where the franchise may or may not be exercised, so as to afford adequate service to the public.

                        Terms and Conditions Within Discretion of Local Body. - The terms and conditions upon which franchises to public utilities are to be granted, unless clearly unreasonable or expressly prohibited by law, rest in the sound discretion of the local body. Mullen

                        Grant of Exclusive Privilege Held Unconstitutional. - Those provisions of an ordinance granting the exclusive privilege to construct and maintain a waterworks within the corporate limits of a town, and the exclusive use of its streets, alleys, sidewalks,
                        public grounds, streams and bridges, came within the confirmation of N.C. Const., Art. I,

                        No Right to Grant Franchise for Use of Streets Absent Legislative Authority. - The law is well settled that the title either of the fee in the soil or an easement is vested in the municipality, in trust for the use of the people as and for a public highway,
                        and that it cannot, without legislative authority, divert them from this use. Therefore, a grant by a city of a franchise allowing gas pipes to be laid in its streets is void unless allowed by express legislation. Elizabeth City

                        City Must Follow Procedural Restrictions of Charter. - Where the charter of a city provides procedural restrictions upon the granting by the city of franchises, such city must follow such procedural restrictions of its charter in granting a franchise,
                        regardless of whether the authority to grant the particular franchise is conferred upon the city by statute or by its own charter. Shaw v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 90</cite>, 152

                        and over its streets and other public ways and to operate such systems for the profit of the grantee is clearly a franchise, for it is the grant of a right which is not held by all persons in common and which may be granted only
                        by the act of the sovereign or its authorized agent. Kornegay v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 155</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 186 (1967).

                        A water company operating under a franchise-contract from a city or town, and receiving the benefits and advantages arising thereunder, may not repudiate the duty of supplying water free to public schools, etc., which it had expressly contracted to do
                        in accepting the franchise containing such provision, and collect for water it had furnished upon quantum meruit or otherwise. Henderson Water Co. v. Trustees of Henderson Graded Schools, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 171</cite>,

                        License Granted to Railroad Not a Permanent Easement. - A license granted by a city to a railroad company to lay a track upon and to that extent use the streets, in the absence of an express power in the charter to do so, cannot be construed into a grant
                        of a permanent easement. State v. Atlantic &amp; N.C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 736</cite>, 53 S.E. 290 (1906).

                        Displacement of Cable Television Service Competition. - The powers conferred upon cities by the North Carolina General Statutes with respect to provision and franchising of cable television service reflect the clear contemplation that competition may
                        be displaced with respect to this service. Madison Cablevision, Inc. v. City of Morganton, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 634</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 200 (1989).

                        Rights of Abutting Owners. - As against the rights of abutting owners, the municipal authorities have no power to grant to a railroad company an easement to lay its track upon and operate its trains over the streets of a town, even though the title to
                        the streets be in the town. Staton v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 428</cite>, 61 S.E. 455 (1908).

                        The General Assembly finds and determines that, in order to avoid the unnecessary duplication of electric facilities and to facilitate the settlement of disputes between cities that are primary suppliers and other electric suppliers, it is desirable for
                        the State to authorize electric suppliers to enter into agreements pursuant to which the parties to the agreements allocate to each other the right to provide electric service to premises each would not have the right to serve
                        under this Article but for the agreement, provided that no agreement between a city that is a primary supplier and another electric supplier shall be enforceable by or against an electric supplier that is subject to the territorial
                        assignment jurisdiction of the North Carolina Utilities Commission until the agreement has been approved by the Commission. The Commission shall approve an agreement entered into pursuant to this section unless it finds that such

                        It shall be unlawful for a primary supplier or secondary supplier to serve premises within a city that the supplier does not have the right to serve under the provisions of this Article. Upon receiving written notice from another supplier of electric
                        service that has authority to lawfully provide service to the premises in dispute that the provision of service by the current supplier is unlawful, the primary supplier or secondary supplier that is providing electric service
                        shall be obligated to discontinue service and remove all of its facilities used in the provision of the unlawful service within 30 days after substitute electric service can be provided by an electric supplier with authority to
                        lawfully provide service to the premises, unless the supplier currently providing service has a good faith basis for believing it has authority to continue rendering such service. If the primary or secondary supplier is determined
                        to be providing electric services unlawfully, and is found to have unreasonably failed to fulfill its obligation to discontinue service as required above, the supplier of electric service that has authority to lawfully provide
                        service to the premises may bring an action to compel performance of those obligations, and may recover in that action its costs of enforcing this subsection, including its reasonable attorneys' fees.

                        Legislative Intent. - By defining and restricting the rights of competing electric companies, the Legislature in the 1965 Electric Act, limited free competition among private electric suppliers in rural areas. It is for the Legislature, not for the court
                        to determine whether legislation other than G.S. 160A-312 is needed to curtail the competitive rights of municipal electric suppliers in rural areas. Duke Power Co. v.

                        Agreement Failed to Meet Requirements of the Statute. - North Carolina Utilities Commission did not err in denying approval of an agreement between a town and a utility company that allocated rights to serve certain areas of the town because the agreement
                        did not meet the requirements of the statute; the parties were not exchanging the right to provide electric service to premises each would not have the right to serve but for the agreement because they already had the right to

                    The lack of adequate recreational programs and facilities is a menace to the morals, happiness, and welfare of the people of this State. Making available recreational opportunities for citizens of all ages is a subject of general interest and concern,
                    and a function requiring appropriate action by both State and local government. The General Assembly therefore declares that the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of this State require adequate recreation programs,
                    that the creation, establishment, and operation of parks and recreation programs is a proper governmental function, and that it is the policy of North Carolina to forever encourage, foster, and provide these facilities and programs
                    for all its citizens.

                        Governmental Immunity. - Determination that a county and a department were not entitled to governmental immunity in a negligence case seeking to recover damages after the estate's decedent drowned in a park area rented out for use by private parties was
                        vacated because the decision turned solely or predominantly on the fact that the services provided could also have been provided by nongovernmental entities, but this distinction lacked the utility it once had; the intermediate
                        appellate court made a passing reference to G.S. 160A-351, which was clearly relevant to the question of whether the maintaining and operating of the park was governmental or proprietary endeavor. However, even if the operation
                        of a parks and recreation program was a governmental function by statute, the question remained whether the specific operation of the swimming area component of the park under these circumstances was a governmental function. Estate

                        G.S. 160A-351 was not dispositive of a town's claim that the town was entitled to the defense of governmental immunity when the town was sued for personal injuries allegedly suffered in the town's park because, even if the operation of a parks and recreation
                        program were a governmental function by statute, not every nuanced action that could occur in a park or other recreational facility was designated as governmental or proprietary in nature by the legislature, and, when the legislature
                        did not directly resolve whether a specific activity was governmental or proprietary in nature, other factors were relevant, including whether the undertaking was one in which only a governmental agency could engage, whether the
                        undertaking was traditionally one provided by a governmental entity, whether a substantial fee was charged for the service provided, and whether that fee did more than simply cover the operating costs of the service provider. Horne

                        because the county was involved in a proprietary function in the operation of the party facilities at the park; the county charged for the use of the park for a private party but did not make a profit from the rental fees for the
                        park, and thus, the county was involved in a traditional government function that could be performed by private entities and did so for a substantial fee although it did not make a profit. Estate of Williams v. Pasquotank County

                        Use of Land for Baseball Stadium. - Although the taxpayers argued that the county's authority to acquire and use land under G.S. 160A-352, G.S. 160A-353, and G.S. 153A-444 did not include the operation of a professional baseball stadium because it was
                        a proprietary venture for pecuniary gain, the court found that G.S. 159-48(b)(13) expressly provided that parks and recreation facilities included stadiums, and neither G.S. 160A-352, G.S. 160A-353, nor G.S. 153-444 prohibited
                        recreational facilities from being operated for a pecuniary gain. Moreover, the lease transaction achieved the proper governmental purpose of erecting a stadium as a recreational facility. Reese v. Mecklenburg County,

                        Dedication for Recreation Facilities Is for Public Purpose. - The power of cities to dedicate real property for use as recreation centers and for other recreational purposes was expressly conferred by former G.S. 160-156, and the exercise of this power
                        was in the public interest and for a public purpose. Brumley v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 691</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 281, 162 A.L.R. 930 (1945). See also, White v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 573</cite>,

                        Although the taxpayers argued that the county's authority to acquire and use land under G.S. 160A-352, G.S. 160A-353, and G.S. 153A-444 did not include the operation of a professional baseball stadium because it was a proprietary venture for pecuniary
                        gain, the court found that G.S. 159-48(b)(13) expressly provided that parks and recreation facilities included stadiums, and neither G.S. 160A-352, G.S. 160A-353, nor G.S. 153-444 prohibited recreational facilities from being operated
                        for a pecuniary gain. Moreover, the lease transaction achieved the proper governmental purpose of erecting a stadium as a recreational facility. Reese v.

                        Issuance of Bonds to Establish Parks and Playgrounds Upheld. - Municipal corporations were given authority by former G.S. 160-156, 160-200(12), and 160-229, to establish parks and playgrounds necessary to the maintenance of the health of their inhabitants;
                        hence, an ordinance of a populous industrial city which provided for the issuance of bonds to establish and maintain parks and playgrounds for the children of the city was a valid exercise of its police power under legislative
                        authority for the promotion of the public health, safety, and morals. Atkins v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 295</cite>, 186 S.E. 330 (1936).

                        subdivision, but does not possess the powers which municipalities are said to possess. Kloster v. Region D Council of Gov'ts, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 245 S.E.2d 180, cert. denied,

                    In the event the Authority fails to perform its obligations with respect to the bonds or notes and foreclosure or similar sale of property subject to a security interest occurs, a deficiency judgment may not be rendered against the Authority except to
                    the extent that the deficiency is payable from either revenues from the regional facility or from any revenues dedicated by act of the General Assembly to the Authority.

                    The Authority may enter a contract of this type in connection with, or incidental to, entering into or maintaining any agreement that secures bonds. A contract shall contain the payment, security, term, default, remedy, and other terms and conditions
                    the Board considers appropriate. The Authority may enter a contract of this type with any person after giving due consideration, where applicable, of the person's creditworthiness as determined by a rating by a nationally recognized
                    rating agency or any other criteria the Board considers appropriate. In connection with, or incidental to, the issuance or carrying of bonds, or the entering of any contract described in this subsection, the Authority may enter into
                    credit enhancement or liquidity agreements, with payment, interest rate, termination date, currency, security, default, remedy, and other terms and conditions as the Authority determines. Proceeds of bonds and any moneys set aside
                    and pledged to secure payment of bonds or any of the contracts entered into under this subsection may be pledged to and used to service any of the contracts entered into under this section.

                    In the discretion of the Authority, any bonds or notes issued under this Part may be secured by a trust instrument between the Authority and a bank or trust company or individual within the State, or a bank or a trust company outside the State, as trustee.
                    The trust instrument or the resolution of the Authority authorizing the issuance of bonds or notes may pledge and assign all or any part of the revenues, funds, and other property provided for the security of the bonds, including proceeds
                    from the sale of any project, or part thereof, insurance proceeds, and condemnation awards, and may convey or mortgage property to secure a bond issue as provided in this Part.

                <p>
                    The revenues and other funds derived from the project, except any part thereof that may be necessary to provide reserves therefor, if any, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust instrument in a sinking fund
                    which may be thereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on the bonds or notes as they become due and of the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as
                    therein provided. This pledge shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made. The revenues so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical
                    delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of the pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether the parties have
                    notice of the pledge. The use and disposition of money to the credit of such sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution or trust instrument. The resolution or trust instrument may contain provisions for protecting
                    and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including, without limitation, any one or more of the following:

                        Any city is authorized to waive its immunity from civil liability in tort by the act of purchasing liability insurance. Participation in a local government risk pool pursuant to Article 23 of General Statute Chapter 58 shall be deemed to be the purchase
                        of insurance for the purposes of this section. Immunity shall be waived only to the extent that the city is indemnified by the insurance contract from tort liability. No formal action other than the purchase of liability insurance
                        shall be required to waive tort immunity, and no city shall be deemed to have waived its tort immunity by any action other than the purchase of liability insurance. If a city uses a funded reserve instead of purchasing insurance
                        against liability for wrongful death, negligence, or intentional damage to personal property, or absolute liability for damage to person or property caused by an act or omission of the city or any of its officers, agents, or employees
                        acting within the scope of their authority and the course of their employment, the city council may adopt a resolution that deems the creation of a funded reserve to be the same as the purchase of insurance under this section.
                        Adoption of such a resolution waives the city's governmental immunity only to the extent specified in the council's resolution, but in no event greater than funds available in the funded reserve for the payment of claims.

                    <li id="t160Aa21s160A-485ol1b">
                        An insurance contract purchased pursuant to this section may cover such torts and such officials, employees, and agents of the city as the governing board may determine. The city may purchase one or more insurance contracts, each covering different torts
                        or different officials, employees, or agents of the city. An insurer who issues a contract of insurance to a city pursuant to this section thereby waives any defense based upon the governmental immunity of the city, and any defense
                        based upon lack of authority for the city to enter into the contract. Each city is authorized to pay the lawful premiums for insurance purchased pursuant to this section.

                        Any plaintiff may maintain a tort claim against a city insured under this section in any court of competent jurisdiction. As to any such claim, to the extent that the city is insured against such claim pursuant to this section, governmental immunity shall
                        be no defense. Except as expressly provided herein, nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive any city of any defense to any tort claim lodged against it, or to restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any defense that
                        the city may have at common law or by virtue of any statute. Nothing in this section shall relieve a plaintiff from any duty to give notice of his claim to the city, or to commence his action within the applicable period of time
                        limited by statute. No judgment may be entered against a city in excess of its insurance policy limits on any tort claim for which it would have been immune but for the purchase of liability insurance pursuant to this section.
                        No judgment may be entered against a city on any tort claim for which it would have been immune but for the purchase of liability insurance pursuant to this section except a claim arising at a time when the city is insured under
                        an insurance contract purchased and issued pursuant to this section. If, in the trial of any tort claim against a city for which it would have been immune but for the purchase of liability insurance pursuant to this section, a
                        verdict is returned awarding damages to the plaintiff in excess of the insurance limits, the presiding judge shall reduce the award to the maximum policy limits before entering judgment.

                        Except as otherwise provided in this section, tort claims against a city shall be governed by the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. No document or exhibit which relates to or alleges facts as to the city's insurance against liability shall be read,
                        exhibited, or mentioned in the presence of the trial jury in the trial of any claim brought pursuant to this section, nor shall the plaintiff, his counsel, or anyone testifying in his behalf directly or indirectly convey to the
                        jury any inference that the city's potential liability is covered by insurance. No judgment may be entered against the city unless the plaintiff waives his right to a jury trial on all issues of law or fact relating to insurance
                        coverage. All issues relating to insurance coverage shall be heard and determined by the judge without resort to a jury. The jury shall be absent during all motions, arguments, testimony, or announcement of findings of fact or
                        conclusions of law with respect to insurance coverage. The city may waive its right to have issues concerning insurance coverage determined by the judge without a jury, and may request a jury trial on these issues.

                        Municipality's Immunity Under Common-Law Rule. - Prior to legislative enactment of these provisions, the common-law rule of governmental immunity prevailed in North Carolina. Under this common-law rule a municipality was not liable for the torts of its
                        employees or agents committed while performing a governmental function. Galligan v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 172</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 427 (1970); Town of Hillsborough v. Smith,

                        Except where waived under authority of statute, the common-law rule of governmental immunity is still the law in North Carolina. Town of Hillsborough v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 178 S.E.2d 18 (1970),

                        In the absence of statutory authority, a municipality has no power to waive its governmental immunity. Galligan v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 172</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 427 (1970).

                        A municipal corporation may not waive or contract away its governmental immunity in the absence of legislative authority for such action. Town of Hillsborough v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 178 S.E.2d 18

                    <p>
                        Waiver to the Extent of Coverage. - Where a municipal corporation procured liability insurance on a vehicle used in the operation of a chemical fogging machine, it waived its governmental immunity for the negligent operation of the vehicle to the extent
                        of the amount of the liability insurance. White v. Mote, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 544</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 75 (1967).

                    <p>
                        In the absence of some affirmative action by a municipality, the purchase of liability insurance will constitute a waiver of its governmental immunity to the extent of the insurance policy so obtained. Galligan v. Town of Chapel Hill,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">276 N.C. 172</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 427 (1970).

                    <p>
                        A city waives its immunity from civil liability in tort by purchasing liability insurance. However, immunity is waived only to the extent that the city is indemnified by the insurance contract. Gordon v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., 576 F. Supp.
                        203 (W.D.N.C. 1983), aff'd, 740 F.2d 961 (4th Cir. 1984).

                    <p>
                        To the extent a city does not purchase liability insurance or participate in a local government risk, a city generally retains immunity from civil liability in tort. Young v. Woodall, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite>                        132, 458 S.E.2d 225 (1995), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 459</cite>, 471 S.E.2d 357 (1996).

                    <p>
                        Where plaintiffs sufficiently alleged waiver of governmental immunity by alleging that defendants maintained liability insurance, the trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to dismiss. Anderson ex rel. Jerome v. Town of Andrews,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 492 S.E.2d 385 (1997).

                    <p>
                        A municipality may waive governmental immunity by the purchase of liability insurance to the extent that the city or town is indemnified by the insurance contract from liability for the acts alleged. Davis v. Messer, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite>                        44, 457 S.E.2d 902 (1995), overruled on other grounds, Willis v. Town of Beaufort, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C.

                    <p>
                        Defendant town which purchased insurance covering itself and its agents, was deemed to have waived its governmental immunity defense to the extent of its coverage. Willis v. Town of Beaufort, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite>                        106, 544 S.E.2d 600 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Under the doctrine of governmental immunity, a municipality is not liable for the torts of its officers and employees if the torts are committed while they are performing a governmental function, unless it has waived civil tort immunity by purchasing
                        liability insurance; immunity is waived only to the extent that the city or town is indemnified by the insurance contract from liability for the acts alleged. Crosby v. City of Gastonia, 682 F. Supp. 2d 537 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 7, 2010),
                        aff'd, 635 F.3d 634, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 4641 (4th Cir. N.C. 2011).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because a city purchased liability insurance coverage, it waived governmental immunity up to the amount of its general liability policy limits; with the ambiguous language in the exclusionary endorsement, the insurance policy was strictly construed as
                        providing coverage for claims that clearly stated provisions preserving governmental immunity would otherwise bar, and the ambiguous endorsement did not exclude the express coverage the city obtained. Meinck v. City of Gastonia,
                        <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 414, 823 S.E.2d 459 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Immunity Not Waived Without Purchase of Insurance. - In the operation of a chemical fogging machine on a street or highway for the purpose of destroying insects, a municipality acts in a governmental capacity in the interest of the public health, and
                        it may not be held liable in tort for injuries resulting therefrom unless it waives its immunity by procuring liability insurance, even though the operation of the machine renders a street or highway hazardous to traffic, since
                        the exception to governmental immunity in failing to keep its streets in a reasonable safe condition relates solely to the maintenance and repair of its streets. Clark v. Scheld, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 732</cite>,
                        117 S.E.2d 838 (1961).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section provides that the only way a city may waive its governmental immunity is by the purchase of liability insurance. Action by the city under G.S. 160A-167 does not waive immunity. Blackwelder v. City of Winston-Salem,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">332 N.C. 319</cite>, 420 S.E.2d 432 (1992).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's denial of the city's motion for summary judgment was affirmed because although the city contended that it was immune from suit under the doctrine of governmental immunity for the claims brought by the mother, and that it had not waived its
                        governmental immunity pursuant to G.S. 160A-485 because it had not purchased liability insurance covering the claims, the mother alleged that the city was negligent in violating G.S. 160A-296, which gave a municipality the authority
                        to regulate the use of its streets and sidewalks and, in addition, imposed a positive duty upon the municipality to keep them in proper repair, in a reasonably safe condition, and free from unnecessary obstructions. G.S. 160A-296(a)(1),
                        (2), and (5). The statute created an exception to the doctrine that a municipality will have immunity from liability for negligence in the performance of a governmental function, and, by reason thereof, the doctrine of governmental
                        immunity had no application to protect a city from liability for a negligent breach of the statutory duties so imposed; moreover, there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether or not the city had actual or implied notice
                        of the obstructions. Beckles-Palomares v. Logan, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 235, 688 S.E.2d 758 (2010).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        New Resolution Against Waiver of Immunity Not Required Each Time Liability Insurance Acquired or Renewed. - To require a town to adopt a new resolution against waiver of immunity each time it renews a liability insurance policy or acquires a new liability
                        policy would place an unnecessary and useless burden upon the town and impose a condition not provided for in former G.S. 160-191.1 nor contemplated by the General Assembly. Galligan v. Town of Chapel Hill,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">276 N.C. 172</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 427 (1970).

                    <p>
                        Waiver as Applied to Agent of Governmental Entity Which Purchased Insurance. - To the extent that defendant town waived its immunity through the purchase of liability insurance, defendant town, and defendant police officer, as sued in his official capacity,
                        were not immune from suit for officer's alleged negligent acts, and summary judgment was properly denied for such claims. Thompson v. Town of Dallas, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 543 S.E.2d
                        901 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Modification of Immunity as Function of Legislature. - Although the doctrine of sovereign immunity was first adopted in North Carolina by the Supreme Court, this judicial doctrine is firmly established in law today, and by legislation has been recognized
                        by the General Assembly as the public policy of the State. Any further modification or the repeal of the doctrine should come from the General Assembly, not the Supreme Court. Steelman v. City of New Bern,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">279 N.C. 589</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 239 (1971).

                        Any change in the doctrine of governmental immunity should come from the General Assembly. Blackwelder v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 319</cite>, 420 S.E.2d 432 (1992).

                    <p>
                        This Section Creates Exception to Common-Law Sovereign Immunity. - Under the common law, a municipality is immune from liability for the torts of its officers committed while they were performing a governmental function. However, this section establishes
                        an exception to the common-law rule: Any city is authorized to waive its immunity from civil liability in tort by the act of purchasing liability insurance. Herndon v. Barrett, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite>                        636, 400 S.E.2d 767 (1991).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Existence of Immunity Prerequisite for Waiver. - Municipalities in North Carolina have never been immune from civil liability for negligence based upon the failing to keep its streets free of unnecessary obstructions, as in untrimmed shrubs and bushes
                        that obstructed the view of motorists using the streets involved; therefore, in the case at bar, insofar as this case is concerned defendant had no immunity to waive and the insolvency of its insurer did not affect its liability.
                        McDonald v. Village of Pinehurst, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 633, 372 S.E.2d 733 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Public Duty Doctrine Did Not Shield a City Engaged in an Ultrahazardous Activity - The plaintiff stated a claim upon which relief could be granted when he alleged that defendant/city was strictly liable for the injuries which he sustained as a result
                        of defendants' use of dynamite, an ultrahazardous activity. The public duty doctrine did not shield the city from liability for this claim because the protection afforded by the public duty doctrine does not extend to local governmental
                        agencies other than law enforcement agencies engaged in their general duty to protect the public. Hargrove v. Billings &amp; Garrett, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 759, 529 S.E.2d 693

                    <p>
                        Methods of Waiver. - City may waive governmental immunity by the purchase of liability insurance or by joining a local government risk pool. Young v. Woodall, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 132, 458 S.E.2d 225 (1995),
                        rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 459</cite>, 471 S.E.2d 357 (1996).

                    <p>
                        This statute explicitly equates participation in a local government risk pool with the purchase of insurance for the purposes of a city's immunity from liability. Lyles v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite>                        96, 461 S.E.2d 347 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Settlement of Claims Does Not Cause Waiver. - Trial court decision denying JNOV to a city, one of its police officers, and its police department was reversed on appeal, because the plaintiff, an arrestee injured in a squad car, failed to prove gross negligence
                        and only showed simple negligence by evidence that the police officer drove 30 to 35 miles above the legal speed limit although he knew that plaintiff was not wearing a seat belt and had to brake suddenly to avoid a collision causing
                        plaintiff to propel into the metal screen in the squad car. City also did not waive governmental immunity by its voluntary settlement with plaintiff since the city had a liability policy and none of the conditions of waiver, as
                        provided by G.S. 160A-485(a), were met. Clayton v. Branson, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 613 S.E.2d 259, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 174</cite>, 625 S.E.2d 785 (2005).

                        City Engaging in Proprietary Function Not Immune. - City which operated a natural gas supply utility was engaged in a proprietary function and, therefore, was not immune from liability for any torts which were proximately caused by it in providing this
                        service. Gregory v. City of Kings Mt., <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 99, 450 S.E.2d 349 (1994).

                        Partial Immunity. - Where city was indemnified for claims in excess of $500,000 through its participation in a local government risk pool any claims for less than that amount were not indemnified because there was a $500,000 deductible for which the city
                        was solely responsibile. Therefore, for claims of $500,000 or less the city retained its immunity. Wall v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 465 S.E.2d 551 (1996).

                        was devoid of any evidence which would tend to show that officer ever told plaintiff or her intestates that any kind of protection would be afforded them or that there was any special relationship between the police and plaintiff's
                        intestates, the only connection between the officer and the two young victims being that which arose as a result of the officer's interviews prior to their father's indictment for sexually abusing them, there was no duty on the
                        part of the police department which would give rise to liability involving the city when the father murdered the children. Coleman v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 188, 366 S.E.2d 2,

                        If there had been a waiver under this section it would not have been negated by the insolvency of municipality's insurance carrier, even though by purchasing liability insurance a municipality waives its immunity only to the extent that it is "indemnified
                        by the insurance contract from tort liability," since in this State, behind every licensed liability insurance company that becomes insolvent is an agency created by G.S. 58-48-25 that to some extent and under certain conditions,
                        takes over the insolvent's obligations to indemnify its insureds by paying legally entitled claimants. McDonald v. Village of Pinehurst, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 633, 372 S.E.2d 733 (1988).

                        When police officer's horse stepped on plaintiff's foot, and the officer was assigned to patrol fair in her capacity as a member of the Special Operations Division, Mounted Patrol Unit, and was responding to a fellow officer's radio call for assistance,
                        the city and officer, in her official capacity, were immune from suit under the doctrine of governmental immunity for damages of $250,000 or less; however, to the extent plaintiff's claim exceeded $250,000, the city and officer

                        Taken in the light most favorable to the police officers, if the City had a duty to fund the pension fund, then the act of funding the fund would be a governmental function rather than a proprietary one; the City offered an affidavit showing it had no
                        liability insurance for the officers' fiduciary duty claim. The officers offered nothing to rebut the City's affidavit; therefore, the City did not waive tort immunity for the officers' fiduciary duty claim, and the City was entitled
                        to summary judgment as to this claim. Crosby v. City of Gastonia, 682 F. Supp. 2d 537 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 7, 2010), aff'd, 635 F.3d 634, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 4641 (4th Cir. N.C. 2011).

                        Trial court did not err when, after weighing the evidence presented by the parties, it determined the town did not waive sovereign immunity through the purchase of its insurance policy because the sovereign immunity non-waiver endorsement stated that
                        nothing in the town's insurance policy, coverage part or coverage form waived sovereign immunity for any insured; and that endorsement expressly indicated that it modified the insurance provided under each of the five coverage

                        Constitutionality of Article. - Condemnation of blighted and slum areas within a municipality for redevelopment under safeguards to prevent such areas from reverting to slum areas is in the interest of the public health, safety, morals and welfare, and
                        therefore such condemnation is for a public use and is not a taking of private property in violation of N.C. Const., Art. I,

                        impossible future blight and its injurious consequences. This is, in its broad purpose, a preventive measure. Horton v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 605</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 464 (1963).

                        Wisdom of Article a Legislative Question. - It may be that the urban redevelopment project may prove eventually to be a disappointment, and is ill advised, but the wisdom of the enactment is a legislative and not a judicial question. Horton v. Redevelopment

                        A redevelopment commission is a municipal corporation for the purpose of tax exemption. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 585</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 476 (1968).

                        In an action brought by a redevelopment commission against city and county to restrain collection of ad valorem taxes upon real property held by the commission, where the commissioner's allegations showed the acquisition of the property with intent to
                        use it for a public purpose, a definite plan evolved for its use for the public, and an actual public use of the property, the Court of Appeals erred in holding, as a matter of law, that such income-producing property held and
                        acquired for redevelopment purposes was not exempt from taxation because it produced income. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 585</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 476 (1968).

                        Definite Guide Prescribed for Creation of Redevelopment Commission. - The General Assembly has prescribed a definite and adequate guide, and the governing body of the municipality in creating or not creating a redevelopment commission cannot act in its

                        Meaning of "Municipality" or "Municipal Corporation". - The term "municipality" or "municipal corporation" has been defined as any incorporated city, town or village, or county. Sides v. Cabarrus Mem. Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite>                        117, 205 S.E.2d 784 (1974), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 14</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 297 (1975).

                    <p>
                        A municipal corporation, city or town, is an agency created by the State to assist in the civil government of a designated territory and the people embraced within these limits. Sides v. Cabarrus Mem. Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite>                        117, 205 S.E.2d 784 (1974), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 14</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 297 (1975).

                    <p>
                        The term "municipal corporation" should not be construed narrowly to include only cities, towns, counties and school districts; in its broader sense the term includes all public corporations exercising governmental functions within constitutional limitations.
                        Sides v. Cabarrus Mem. Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 117, 205 S.E.2d 784 (1974), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 14</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 297 (1975).

                        Time for Consideration of Evidence of Condition of Condemned Property. - In its review of a redevelopment commission's determination that a property is blighted, the trial court should consider evidence relating to the condition of the condemned property
                        at the time the commission's plan is approved by the city council. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Agapion, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 346, 499 S.E.2d 474 (1998).

                    <p>
                        Condemnation of Less Than All Property in Blighted Area. - Where an area was certified as a blighted area by the planning board, it was with the discretion of the redevelopment commission to condemn two vacant lots within the area without condemning all
                        other lots therein. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 500 S.E.2d 118 (1998).

                    <p>
                        Areas which are "blighted" cannot be enlarged to include areas which are not in fact "blighted." Any other conclusion would vest a redevelopment commission with authority which the legislature has expressly denied it. Horton v. Redevelopment Comm'n,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">264 N.C. 1</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 728 (1965).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The legislature never intended to permit a planning commission or a redevelopment commission to include within the boundaries of a "blighted area" an area not meeting the statutory definition, even though the area might qualify as a nonresidential area,
                        or as a rehabilitation, conservation and reconditioning area. Horton v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 1</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 728 (1965).

                    <p>
                        Conditions May Be Corrected in Redevelopment Area Embracing Blighted and Other Defined Areas. - A planning commission may correct objectionable conditions within a redevelopment area consisting of a blighted area, a nonresidential redevelopment area,
                        and a rehabilitation, conservation and reconditioning area. Horton v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 1</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 728 (1965).

                        What Property in Rehabilitation, Conservation and Reconditioning Area Subject to Eminent Domain. - In a "rehabilitation, conservation and reconditioning area," no individual tract, building or improvement shall be subject to the power of eminent domain,
                        within the meaning of this Article, unless it is "blighted" property and substantially contributes to the condition endangering the area. Horton v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 306</cite>,

                        Power of Housing Authority to Close Public Streets. - Although the City of Raleigh did not delegate its police power to close public streets to the Housing Authority of Raleigh, the authority did not lack that power, since it had power to take public
                        streets by eminent domain with the city's consent, and to carry out redevelopment projects, which included removal of existing streets, utilities or other improvements. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Housing Auth.,

                        Counsel Fees Provision of Subdivision (10) Helps Equalize Bargaining Power. - Provision of subdivision (10) providing that the commission pay counsel fees for the property owner when it is necessary to condemn his property, grants more freedom to the
                        property owner to contest condemnation proceedings, as it permits him to receive the award for his property, even after legal action, without having it reduced by the payment of attorneys' fees. It helps to equalize the bargaining
                        power of the property owner and the commission and prevent, insofar as possible, any undue economic pressures. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hyder, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 201 S.E.2d 236
                        (1973).

                    <p>
                        Control over the amount of the attorneys' fees allowed is found in the requirement that such counsel fees are to be fixed by the court and are to be reasonable in amount. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hyder, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite>                        241, 201 S.E.2d 236 (1973).

                    <p>
                        Allowance of attorneys' fees under subdivision (10)h3 is by the court, and is not affected by the existence of contracts for fees between counsel and their landowner clients. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hyder, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite>                        241, 201 S.E.2d 236 (1973).

                    <p>
                        Determination of Reasonable Counsel Fees. - Reasonable counsel fees in subdivision (10)h3 may be determined in part by the amount of the verdict obtained in the condemnation proceeding, in the light of the proposals made to the property owner prior to
                        his employment of an attorney. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hyder, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 201 S.E.2d 236 (1973).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The results obtained by an attorney are a legitimate consideration in determining the amount of his fee. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hyder, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 201 S.E.2d 236 (1973).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Payment of Fee Must Be Commensurate with Services Performed. - There is no uncertainty under subdivision (10)h3 about the payment of an attorney fee commensurate with the services performed. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hyder,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 201 S.E.2d 236 (1973).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Award Is Not Contingent Fee. - When a statute, such as this section, provides for attorney fees to be awarded as a part of the costs to be paid by the governmental authority which is appropriating property, such award is not a contingent fee, but an amount
                        equal to the actual reasonable value of the attorney's services. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hyder, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 201 S.E.2d 236 (1973).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether there was any recovery or not, counsel for the property owner is entitled to a reasonable fee, and it should not be set upon the basis of a contingency which did not exist. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hyder, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite>                        241, 201 S.E.2d 236 (1973).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The element of risk in connection with a contingent fee justifies a much larger fee when litigation is successfully terminated, but in eminent domain takings under subdivision (10)h3, there is no such risk, and the court must take this lack of risk into
                        account. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hyder, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 201 S.E.2d 236 (1973).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A trial court erred in dismissing an action to condemn land for urban renewal where there was no finding that the redevelopment commission failed to comply with the statutory procedures prerequisite to an exercise of the power of eminent domain by it,
                        and there was no allegation, proof, or finding that the redevelopment commission arbitrarily abused its discretion or acted in bad faith in selecting the area in question. The court's findings that the property of respondents did
                        not lie within a blighted area or within a nonresidential redevelopment area as defined in this section was an insufficient basis for dismissal of the action. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>,

      </b> - An amendment to subdivision (6) of this section by Session Laws 1993, c. 497, s. 17, was made effective upon certification of approval of an amendment to Article V of the Constitution of North Carolina relating to the
                    authority of any county, city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects. This amendment was
                    submitted to the people on November 2, 1993 and was defeated. The amendment to subdivision (6) of this section, therefore, never took effect.

                        urban redevelopment activities undertaken to promote the health, safety, and welfare of North Carolina citizens were governmental functions, (2) the legislature determined private enterprise alone could not address urban blight,
                        (3) the lease was a valid urban redevelopment and downtown revitalization activity, (4) the city did not seek to make a profit from the lease, and (5) the fees the city charged under the lease were not substantial and did not cover

                        Selection as to Route, Quantity, etc., Is Largely Discretionary. - Where the general power to condemn exists, the right of selection as to route, quantity, etc., is left largely to the discretion of the company or corporation, and does not become the
                        subject of judicial inquiry except on allegations of fact tending to show bad faith on the part of the company or corporation or an oppressive and manifest abuse of the discretion conferred upon them by the law. Redevelopment Comm'n

                        Sufficiency of Condemnation Petition. - A petition to condemn land for urban renewal was sufficient under the Rules of Civil Procedure to state a claim for relief, where it gave notice of the nature and basis of the petitioners' claim and the type of
                        case brought, and alleged generally the occurrence or performance of the conditions precedent required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160.html" target="_blank">Chapter 160</a></cite>, Article

                        Affirmative Allegation of Compliance with Statutory Requirements Necessary. - In order to invoke the power of condemnation, the redevelopment commission must affirmatively allege compliance with the statutory requirements. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes,
                        <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 345 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Necessary Facts Must Be Alleged in Each Separate Proceeding. - If a redevelopment commission elects to institute a separate and distinct proceeding for each parcel of land taken, it must, in each instance, allege all the facts necessary to justify the
                        taking. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391 (1962).

                    <p>
                        Joinder of Owners of Different Tracts in One Proceeding. - Where it is sought to condemn several tracts of land belonging to different owners, all the owners may be joined in one proceeding, in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary. Such
                        a course is convenient, and can injure no one if damages are separately assessed to each owner. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391 (1962).

                        Each owner is entitled to defend upon the ground his property does not qualify for the purpose intended, or that its selection was the result of arbitrary or capricious conduct on the part of the taking agency. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins,

                        Determining Fair Market Value. - In determining the fair market value of property taken in condemnation, it is generally regarded as competent to show the value of the property within a reasonable time before and/or after the taking as bearing upon its
                        value at the time of the appropriation. The rule is necessarily one of variableness in the time limits, depending upon the nature of the property, its location and surrounding circumstances, and whether the evidence offered fairly
                        points to its value at the time in question. Wilson Redevelopment Comm'n v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 271, 164 S.E.2d 495 (1968).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rule allowing evidence of value before or after the taking is analogous to the rule which allows evidence of the purchase price paid for property sometime prior to the date of taking. Wilson Redevelopment Comm'n v. Stewart,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 271, 164 S.E.2d 495 (1968).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In determining whether evidence of the value at sometime prior to the taking is admissible to show fair market value at the time of the taking, the inquiry is whether under all the circumstances that appraisal fairly points to the value of the property
                        at the time of the taking. Wilson Redevelopment Comm'n v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 271, 164 S.E.2d 495 (1968).

                    <p>
                        Scope of Cross-Examination. - It would seem that the utmost freedom of cross-examination with reference to sales and sales prices in the vicinity should be accorded the landowner, subject to the right and duty of the presiding judge to exercise his sound
                        discretion in controlling the nature and scope of the cross-examination in the interest of justice and in confining the testimony within the rules of competency, relevancy and materiality. It follows that the condemnor should be
                        accorded similar freedom. Wilson Redevelopment Comm'n v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 271, 164 S.E.2d 495 (1968).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sales prices of nearby property are admissible on cross-examination to test the witness' knowledge of values and for the purposes of impeachment. Wilson Redevelopment Comm'n v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite>                        271, 164 S.E.2d 495 (1968).

                    <p>
                        Role of Judicial Review Limited. - In determining whether a particular area may legally be selected for redevelopment, the role of judicial review is severely limited by the rule that the finding of the redevelopment authority, or similar administrative
                        agency, that a particular area is "blighted," that redevelopment serves a "public use," or the like, is not generally reviewable, unless fraudulent or capricious, or, in some instances, unless the evidence against the finding is
                        overwhelming. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 345 (1971).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        A trial court erred in dismissing an action to condemn land for urban renewal where there was no finding that the redevelopment commission failed to comply with the statutory procedures prerequisite to an exercise of the power of eminent domain by it,
                        and there was no allegation, proof or finding that the redevelopment commission arbitrarily abused its discretion or acted in bad faith in selecting the area in question. The court's findings that the property of respondents did
                        not lie within a blighted area or a nonresidential redevelopment area, as defined in G.S. 160A-503, was an insufficient basis for dismissal of the action. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>,

                        Urban Redevelopment Plan Not a Necessary Expense Under Former Constitutional Provision. - An urban redevelopment plan was not a necessary expense of a municipality within the meaning of former Art. VII,
                        <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 6, Const. 1868, and therefore a municipality might be enjoined from spending ad valorem taxes or levying taxes and issuing bonds for an urban redevelopment project until and unless such project was approved by a majority
                        of the qualified voters of the municipality; any provisions of former G.S. 160-466(b) and 160-470 authorizing a municipality to levy taxes and issue bonds for such purpose without a vote were unconstitutional. Horton v. Redevelopment
                        Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 605</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 464 (1963). (See now N.C. Const., Art. V,

                        The adoption of the redevelopment plan is equivalent to a cease and desist order preventing any development, rental, or sale of the property within the area. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>,
                        128 S.E.2d 391 (1962).

                        The procedures required by this section are designed to guard against arbitrary action by either the governing body of the community or the redevelopment commission, and thus afford protection to persons owning property in the affected area. Unless these
                        procedures are strictly followed, a redevelopment commission has no authority to exercise the power of eminent domain. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Abeyounis, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 270, 161
                        S.E.2d 191 (1968).

                        Allegations Required in Stating Cause of Action for Condemnation. - A redevelopment commission, in order to state a cause of action for condemnation, must properly allege, inter alia, a redevelopment plan which complies with this section; compliance with
                        the procedures for approval of the redevelopment plan; and approval of the plan by the governing body of the area in which the project is located. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Abeyounis, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite>                        270, 161 S.E.2d 191 (1968).

                    <p>
                        In order to invoke the power of condemnation, the redevelopment commission must affirmatively allege compliance with the statutory requirements. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d
                        345 (1971).

                        Plan Must Provide for Financing Acquisition of Redevelopment Area and Other Necessary Costs. - A redevelopment plan must, under subsection (d)(7) of this section, provide a method of financing of acquisition of the redevelopment area, and of all other
                        costs necessary to prepare the area for redevelopment, which method must, of course, be legal and feasible. Horton v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 306</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 115 (1964).

                    <p>
                        Plan to Finance Entire Area Is Required. - In order that property owners may be protected against threatened taking which is never consummated, the act wisely requires a showing that the acquiring agency has a lawful plan by which, among other things,
                        it may lawfully finance the whole area. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391 (1962).

                    <p>
                        Ability to finance the acquisition of one or two tracts is not a showing of a proper plan for financing the development, including the arrangements for relocating displaced families. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>,

                        under subsection (c) of this section. Thus, the use of the word "may" in subdivision (e)(4) of this section is not mandatory in the sense that it requires a commission to convey to a nonprofit association. Whether there shall be
                        a conveyance is a matter in the discretion of the commission. However, once a commission decides to exercise its authority to so convey, that conveyance must be after a public hearing and "shall be for such consideration as may
                        be agreed upon by the commission and the association or corporation." Campbell v. First Baptist Church, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 476</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 558 (1979).

                        "Exchanges" Within Rule Requiring Advertisement and Bids. - In light of the specifically outlined exceptions to the general rule, coupled with the specific inclusion of "exchanges" within the proviso of subsection (c) of this section, "exchanges" are
                        within the general rule requiring advertisement and bids. Campbell v. First Baptist Church, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 476</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 558 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Treatment of "Exchanges". - An "exchange" is included within the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, unless the commission elects to treat it as a private sale and proceed under the provisions of subsection (e) of this section. Campbell v. First
                        Baptist Church, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 476</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 558 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Exchange of Property with Church Covered by Subsection (d). - The "exchange" of property between a redevelopment commission and a "redeveloper" such as a church is nothing more than a "private sale" of real property to "a nonprofit association or corporation
                        operated exclusively for educational, scientific, literary, cultural, charitable or religious purposes" as described in subsection (d) of this section, and such exchange must be in compliance with all of the requirements of subsection
                        (d). Campbell v. First Baptist Church, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 117, 250 S.E.2d 68 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 476</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 558 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Limits of Municipal Governing Body's Authority Under Subsection (d). - The provision of subsection (d) of this section, making sales of municipal redevelopment commission property subject to the approval of the governing body of the municipality, merely
                        places final authority in the board to determine whether all submitted bids satisfy the zoning requirements of the district and are in general conformity with the redevelopment plan, and does not give the board authority to determine
                        which bid "more nearly" complies with the redevelopment plan. Porsh Bldrs., Inc. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 550</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 443 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Acceptance of Highest Responsible Bid Required. - In selling the property of a municipal redevelopment commission to private developers, the municipal board of aldermen is required to accept the "highest responsible bid," if any, where that bid complies
                        with the applicable zoning restrictions and the redevelopment plan for the property to be sold. Porsh Bldrs., Inc. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 550</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 443 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Criteria in Determining "Responsible" Bidder. - In this section, which provides for sale of municipal redevelopment commission property to the "highest responsible bidder," the term "responsible" was intended to give the municipality power to use its
                        discretion only to the extent of determining whether a bidder had the resources and financial ability to complete the project set forth in his proposal for the development of the property; it does not allow the municipality to
                        consider which bid best complies with the redevelopment plan. Porsh Bldrs., Inc. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 550</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 443 (1981).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Lower Bid "More Nearly" Complying with Plan May Not Be Accepted. - The provision of subsection (d) of this section giving the governing board of a municipality the power to reject all bids for redevelopment commission property does not impliedly authorize
                        the board to reject the highest bid if a lower bid "more nearly" complies with the redevelopment plan. Porsh Bldrs., Inc. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 550</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 443
                        (1981).

                    <p>
                        Procedure for Conveyance to "Nonprofit Association or Corporation". - Before it can lawfully convey property to a "nonprofit association or corporation," a redevelopment commission must: (1) Hold a public hearing on the proposed conveyance after proper
                        advertisement; (2) Get approval for the proposed conveyance from the governing body of the municipality; and (3) Agree with the proposed transferee on consideration for the conveyance which is not less than the fair value of the
                        property as determined by a committee of three professional real estate appraisers. Campbell v. First Baptist Church, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 117, 250 S.E.2d 68 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 476</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Public Purpose Not Negated by Sale to Private Redeveloper. - The fact that a municipal redevelopment commission may exchange, sell or transfer slum property condemned by it for redevelopment to private persons does not affect the question of whether the
                        taking is for a public use, since the statute provides safeguards in the use and control of the land by the private developer to prevent the area from again becoming a blighted area, and the sale or transfer to the redeveloper
                        is merely incidental or collateral to the primary purpose of clearing the slum area in the interest of the public health, safety, morals and welfare. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Security Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 595</cite>,
                        114 S.E.2d 688 (1960).

                    <p>
                        The condemnation of blighted and slum areas within a municipality and the sale or exchange thereof to any redeveloper for residential, recreational, commercial, industrial or other uses or for public use in accordance with the redevelopment plan, under
                        safeguards to prevent such areas from reverting to slum areas, is in the interest of the public health, safety, morals and welfare, and therefore such condemnation is for a public purpose. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp.,

                        of thirty percent (30%) of the ad valorem tax rate in effect in the city in the fiscal year prior to the establishment of the district. After the private streets have been upgraded to meet public street standards and all costs

                    council call upon the city attorney or chief law officer of the city for such legal services as it may require, or it may employ its own counsel and legal staff. An authority may delegate to one or more of its agents or employees such
