                        <p>
                            For discussion of costs generally, see State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 877</cite>, 10 S.E. 608 (1889).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jurisdiction of Court to Make Award. - Because a successor judge lacked jurisdiction to overrule a prior judge's denial of summary judgment and to award summary judgment to plaintiffs on their second claim for relief, a valid judgment was not awarded
                            to the plaintiffs so that they were not to be considered the prevailing parties; thus, there was not a statutory basis for the award of costs to the plaintiffs. Cail v. Cerwin, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite>                            176, 648 S.E.2d 510 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 75</cite>, 705 S.E.2d 743, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 50 (2011).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a medical malpractice action, the trial court erred by taxing costs against a doctor and a medical center, pursuant to G.S. 6-1, as the order taxing the costs was made after the appeal was filed, therefore, the trial court lacked subject matter to
                            enter the order. Swink v. Weintraub, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 672 S.E.2d 53 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 812</cite>, 693 S.E.2d 144, N.C. LEXIS 78
                            (2010).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Costs Follow the Judgment. - In general this section states the rule that costs follow the judgment, a rule which is founded on policy and natural justice, designed to prevent the unsuccessful litigant from escaping the consequence ensuing from the unfavorable
                            termination of a suit, and which, to a great extent, acts as deterrent to the prosecution or appeal of promiscuous and frivolous litigation. Criminal actions and civil suits alike are controlled by the principle. In State v.
                            Horne, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 853</cite>, 26 S.E. 36 (1896), it is said: "There is no exception in State cases to the rule prevailing in civil cases that the costs follow the result of the
                            final judgment." The true and only test of liability for costs depends upon the nature of the final judgment, and the party cast in the suit is the one upon whom the costs must fall. Kincaid v. Graham, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 154</cite>                            (1885); Williams v. Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 17</cite>, 51 S.E. 790 (1905); Smith v. Cashie &amp; Cowan R.R. &amp; Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. 334</cite>, 62 S.E. 416 (1908); Kinston Cotton Mills
                            v. Rocky Mount Hosiery Co., <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. 462</cite>, 70 S.E. 910 (1911); Ritchie v. Ritchie, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 538</cite>, 135 S.E. 458 (1926).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This basic rule of costs is underlying throughout and apparent from the other provisions of this chapter, and, as stated in Costin v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. 111</cite> (1846), "in no instance found in the books
                            has the losing party recovered his costs or any part of them."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Investors' claim that the trial court erred in allowing costs under G.S. 6-1 to the appraisers based on a claim that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the appraisers was rejected as the summary judgment for the appraisers had been
                            affirmed. Williams v. United Cmty. Bank, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 361, 724 S.E.2d 543 (2012).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial judges are authorized to tax court costs, and if the court misused its authority in taxing costs against pauper plaintiff, that error was waived by her failure to appeal therefrom. Schaffner v. Pantelakos, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite>                            399, 391 S.E.2d 41 (1990).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At common law neither party to a civil action could recover costs. Costin v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. 111</cite> (1846); State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 877</cite>, 10 S.E. 608 (1889); Charwick
                            v. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 380</cite>, 74 S.E. 115 (1912); Waldo v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 461</cite>, 100 S.E. 182 (1919); City of Charlotte v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 684</cite>,
                            190 S.E.2d 179 (1972).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And each party paid his own witnesses. City of Charlotte v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 684</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 179 (1972).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Costs are entirely creatures of legislation, etc, without which they do not exist. Clerk's Office v. Commissioners of Carteret County, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 29</cite>, 27 S.E. 1003 (1897).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today in this State, all costs are given in a court of law by virtue of some statute. Costs, in this State, are entirely creatures of legislation, and without this they do not exist. City of Charlotte v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 684</cite>,
                            190 S.E.2d 179 (1972).
                        </p>

                            The court's power to tax costs is entirely dependent upon statutory authorization. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 1</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 641 (1972).

                        <p>
                            An award of costs is an exercise of statutory authority; if the statute is misinterpreted, the judgment is erroneous. City of Charlotte v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 684</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 179 (1972).

                            be taxed as costs against a non-prevailing opposing party; pursuant to North Carolina Supreme Court precedent, the only expenses which could be taxed as costs were those specifically authorized by statute. DOT v. Charlotte

                            Statutes Are Strictly Construed. - Since the right to tax costs did not exist at common law and costs are considered penal in their nature, statutes relating to costs are strictly construed. City of Charlotte v. McNeely,
                            <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 684</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 179 (1972).

                            Costs May Not Be Adjudged on Mere Equitable or Moral Grounds. - Since costs may be taxed solely on the basis of statutory authority, it follows a fortiori that courts have no power to adjudge costs against anyone on mere equitable or moral grounds. City
                            of Charlotte v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 684</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 179 (1972).

                            Parties Are Entitled to Actual Costs Reasonably Incurred and Specifically Authorized. - Parties to whom judgment is given are entitled to recover their actual costs reasonably incurred and specifically authorized by statutes. Such reimbursement is the
                            limit of their entitlement. City of Charlotte v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 684</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 179 (1972).

                            Failure to Segregate Mandatory From Discretionary Costs. - Trial court's failure to segregate statutorily required costs from discretionary costs is not a failure to exercise the court's discretion. Priest v. Safety-Kleen Sys.,

                            Parties Subject to Costs. - Judgment awarding defendants costs after a partial summary judgment was entered for defendants on a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim was affirmed as under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                            N.C. R. Civ. P. 54(b), a summary judgment on less than all of the claims or parties that had not been certified as final did not terminate the action as to any of the parties; since plaintiffs failed to obtain a certificate
                            of finality and the trial court had the authority to revise or reverse the interlocutory order, defendants remained parties subject to costs under G.S. 6-1. Green v. Kearny, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 739

                            of appeal from the judgment in favor of a chairman of a county airport authority who had been improperly removed from his position; an exception did not apply, as the award of attorney fees under G.S. 6-1, G.S. 6-20, G.S. 6-19.1,

                            The power to make an allowance of attorneys' fees from a fund brought into court is susceptible of great abuse, and should be exercised with jealous caution. With the power of award being limited to items of reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, so
                            as to exclude compensation or allowance of any kind for the time and effort of the suing taxpayer, thus fixing it so the taxpayer may not capitalize on the suit, there is no real danger of abuse. City of Charlotte v. McNeely,

                            In construing this section, it is not necessary to resort to rules of construction. Clearly, the legislature did not contemplate that a party would disburse or become liable to himself for a fee when he testified as a witness for himself in his own case.
                            Neither did it contemplate that a party would pay an officer to subpoena himself as a witness. City of Charlotte v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 684</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 179 (1972).

                            The testimony of expert civil engineer that his plan for widening street was as good as city's was totally irrelevant to the question of city's right to condemn the property in question. The record disclosed no facts which would justify taxing, as a part
                            of the costs for which the city was liable, an expert witness fee. City of Charlotte v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 684</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 179 (1972).

                        Judgment May Be Rendered Against State for Costs. - Upon the failure of the litigation, the State is, under this section, liable for the costs of an action authorized by act of the General Assembly and prosecuted in its name by the district attorney,
                        and judgment may be rendered in such action against the State for such costs. State ex rel. Blount v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 50</cite>, 25 S.E. 789 (1896).

                        State's Liability Dependent upon Statute. - The general statutes giving costs do not include the sovereign, and the State is only liable for costs in the event of express statutory provisions. State ex rel. Blount v. Simmons,
                        <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 19</cite>, 26 S.E. 649 (1897).

                        Disbarment Proceedings. - Where the proceedings for disbarment of an attorney have not been sustained, the costs are taxable against the State under the provisions of this section, and an order erroneously taxing them against the county in which the matter
                        was tried will be vacated. State ex rel. Committee on Grievances v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 619</cite>, 161 S.E. 76 (1931).

                    <p>
                        Actions to Vacate Oyster-Bed Entry. - Where, in an action by the district attorney in the name of the State to vacate an oyster-bed entry, the plaintiff was nonsuited, it was error to tax the costs against the county, which was not a party to the action.
                        State ex rel. Blount v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 9</cite>, 23 S.E. 923 (1896).

                    <p>
                        Under this section the State is liable for the costs of an action instituted by the district attorney solicitor to vacate an oyster-bed entry. In such case, it seems that the persons making the required affidavit, alleging that the entry is a fraud upon
                        the State, might be held liable as relators if it should appear that the action was for their benefit and at their instance. State ex rel. Blount v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 19</cite>, 26

                            When the trial court found plaintiff in contempt under G.S. 5A-21, it erred in awarding attorney fees to defendant as sanctions; such an award was not authorized by statute, as G.S. 6-18 and G.S. 6-20, governing costs, did not apply to a contempt proceeding.

                            Appellate Court has approved the allowance of attorney's fees in contempt actions where such fees were expressly authorized by statute as in the case of child support.

                            Kirk, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 767 S.E.2d 632 (2014).

                        <p>
                            Meaning of Recovery. - The recovery referred to in this section is a final determination upon the merits, and success in the appellate court is by no means equivalent to a recovery in the court below. Williams v. Hughes,
                            <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 17</cite>, 51 S.E. 790 (1905).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A recovery within the meaning of the section cannot be predicated upon anything coming to the plaintiff which was not in the contemplation of the plaintiff when he filed his complaint, and especially of a thing to which he virtually disclaimed any right
                            or title. Patterson v. Ramsey, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 561</cite>, 48 S.E. 811 (1904).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to determine who should pay the costs, the general result must be considered and inquiry made as to who has, in the view of the law, succeeded in the action. Patterson v. Ramsey, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 561</cite>,
                            48 S.E. 811 (1904).

                        <p>
                            Because plaintiff's legal fees and other costs were not recoverable as independent damages on a fraud claim, and he did not allege that he suffered any other damage, he failed to prove that he suffered legally cognizable damages as a result of a misrepresentation
                            by defendant. Under North Carolina law, a successful litigant could not recover attorneys' fees, whether as costs or as an item of damages, unless such a recovery was expressly authorized by statute, and costs were recoverable
                            only in certain listed types of cases, none of which applied, or at the discretion of the court to a prevailing party, which necessarily meant establishing a prima facie case that, in the context of fraud, had to include independent
                            damages aside from costs. Hoch v. Hoch (In re Hoch), - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Jan. 25, 2018).

                        <p>
                            Partial Recovery. - There is no provision that limits the allowance of costs in favor of the plaintiff in case of only a partial recovery. The language of the statute as to them is comprehensive and without exceptive provision. In Wall v. Covington,
                            <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 150</cite> (1877), it was held that no part of the costs in such actions can be taxed against the party recovering. And in Horton v. Horne, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. 219</cite>, 5 S.E. 927
                            (1888), it was decided in an action to recover personal property, that if the plaintiff establishes his title to only a portion of the property delivered to him under claim and delivery proceedings, he will be entitled to costs.
                            Wooten v. Walters,
                            <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 251</cite>, 14 S.E. 734 (1892); Ferrabow v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 414</cite>, 14 S.E. 973 (1892); Kinston Cotton Mills v. Rocky Mount Hosiery Co., <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. 462</cite>,

                            Action by Executor. - Where the action involves the question as to the recovery of a portion of the estate of a deceased person, and judgment is rendered in favor of the executor, the plaintiff, he is entitled to a judgment for costs under this section.
                            White v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 89</cite>, 144 S.E. 526 (1928).

                            Abuse of Discretion to Reduce Attorneys' Fees Based on Punitive Damages Award. - Trial court abused its discretion to the extent that it reduced the amount of attorneys' fees that it would have otherwise awarded to beneficiaries based solely on the fact
                            that the beneficiaries received a large punitive damages award because the fact that they received a large punitive damages award was not relevant to a proper attorneys' fee calculation. Lacey v. Kirk,
                            <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 767 S.E.2d 632 (2014).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result of the different purposes sought to be achieved by punitive damages and attorneys' fee awards, a decision to reduce an attorneys' fee award based on the fact that a party received a large punitive damages award would necessarily serve to thwart
                            the purposes sought to be achieved by allowing the recovery of punitive damages without serving any purpose sought to be achieved by an award of attorneys' fees. Lacey v. Kirk, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite>                            376, 767 S.E.2d 632 (2014).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although attorneys' fee jurisprudence gives trial judges substantial discretion in determining what amount of attorneys' fees to award in any particular case, the use of a substantial punitive damages award as the sole reason for reducing an otherwise
                            reasonable attorneys' fee award involves reliance upon a factor that has no reasonable bearing on the making of a proper attorneys' fee award and, for that reason, constitutes an abuse of the trial court's discretion. Lacey

                            Construed with G.S. 6-19 - Costs were properly awarded to the animal shelter pursuant to G.S. 6-19, as G.S. 6-19 permitted the shelter, as a defendant, to recover costs in the same way as a plaintiff could pursuant to this section in an action for the

                            personalty are related sections, pertain to the same subject matter, and must be construed in pari materia. Bailey v. Hayman, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 58</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 6 (1942).

                            Partial Recovery. - Where the plaintiff is adjudged entitled to a part of the land sued for, whether such land is a portion of one tract or is one of several tracts for which the action is brought, then the plaintiff is exonerated as to costs and no part
                            thereof should be found against him. Ferrabow v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 414</cite>, 14 S.E. 973 (1892); Moore v. Angel, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 843</cite>, 21 S.E. 699 (1895);

                            Where the plaintiff has been required to introduce evidence of his title to the whole of the locus in quo, and then the defendant consents that the court charge the jury to find for the plaintiff if they believe the evidence as to a certain part, and
                            the issue is found for the defendant as to the remaining land, the costs of the action are properly awarded against the defendant. Swain v. Clemmons, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 240</cite>, 95

                            When There Is More Than One Issue. - In an action of trespass to real property, where the plaintiff's title and the fact of trespass are both put in issue by the defendant's answer, and the jury find the issue as to the title in favor of the plaintiff,
                            and the issue as to the trespass in favor of the defendant, the defendant is entitled to judgment for costs. To entitle the plaintiff to recover costs, both issues must be found in his favor. Murray v. Spencer,

                            Boundary Dispute. - Where, in an action in ejectment and for damages for cutting of timber, defendant files an answer defending plaintiffs' title to the land in dispute, and verdict is entered in favor of plaintiffs, plaintiffs, as a matter of law, are
                            not liable for any of the costs, notwithstanding that upon the trial each party admitted the title of the other within the boundaries of their respective grants, and the only controversy was as to the location of the boundary
                            between their respective grants. Cody v. England, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 40</cite>, 19 S.E.2d 10 (1942).

                            Necessity for Disclaimer in Order to Avoid Costs. - A defendant in an action concerning land should enter a disclaimer if he does not claim the land in controversy, or does not intend to litigate with the plaintiff, in order to escape the payment of costs.
                            Swain v. Clemmons, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 240</cite>, 95 S.E. 489 (1918).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where, in an action in trespass, the defendant failed to disclaim title to all the land declared for by plaintiff, but recovered according to the boundaries set up in his answer, with a greater amount for damages on his counterclaim than was allowed the
                            plaintiff, plaintiff was nevertheless held entitled to costs. Moore v. Angel, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 843</cite>, 21 S.E. 699 (1895).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the defendant disclaims title to all the land declared for, except that for which he proves his right, no issue as to the plaintiff's title will arise, and the findings that the defendant's title, disputed by the plaintiff, is good and that the defendant
                            has sustained greater damages than his adversary, upon both necessarily, perhaps on either, will entitle the defendant to costs. Moore v. Angel, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 843</cite>, 21 S.E.
                            699 (1895).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In ejectment, where the defendant denies the right to possession and denies that the plaintiff holds the title in trust for him, and judgment is rendered that the defendant is entitled to the land upon payment of an amount found due the plaintiff, no
                            part of the cost is taxable against the defendant. Patterson v. Ramsey, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 561</cite>, 48 S.E. 811 (1904).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It would seem that in order to escape potential liability for costs the defendant must enter his disclaimer of all the lands declared for, and that a disclaimer of half the locus in quo will not suffice to enable him to escape upon the unfavorable adjudication
                            of the other half. See In re Hurley, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 422</cite>, 117 S.E. 345 (1923).

                            Liability of Intervener. - Where the defendant intervenes in an action to recover real property, files a joint answer with his codefendant, and makes a joint defense, the plaintiff is entitled to the costs. Having joined in the controversy, and made common
                            cause in the defense, interveners must abide the result. Spruill v. Arrington, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 192</cite>, 13 S.E. 779 (1891). See Willis v. Coleburn, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 670</cite>,

                            Partial Recovery. - There is no exception to the partial recovery rule when the action is for the recovery of personalty, and when the plaintiff establishes title to any part of the property sued for, he is entitled to judgment for costs. Wooten v. Walters,
                            <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 251</cite>, 14 S.E. 734 (1892); Field v. Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 264</cite>, 26 S.E. 812 (1897). This is not the case where some of the defendants recover judgment, in which case,
                            of course, they recover costs. Phillips v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 282</cite>, 61 S.E. 49 (1908).

                            As an example of the application of this rule to claims for personal property, it has been held that the plaintiff on being adjudged entitled to only a portion of a crop in a suit for claim and delivery was entitled to costs. Field v. Wheeler,

                            favor upon an issue of fraud, the question of taxing the cost did not depend upon the finding of the jury on the issue of the defendant's fraud, and the plaintiff, having established his right to the possession, was entitled
                            to recover the costs under this section. Maxton Auto Co. v. Rudd, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 497</cite>, 97 S.E. 477 (1918).

                        Not Applicable to Negligence Actions. - Negligence cases were not listed among the types of actions in which costs had to be awarded to a prevailing party pursuant to either G.S. 6-18 or G.S. 6-19; therefore, the trial court's costs ruling was governed
                        by G.S. 6-20, and costs could be allowed or not, in the discretion of the court. Smith v. Cregan, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 632 S.E.2d 206 (2006).

                        Where plaintiff fails to recover in an action involving title to real property in which a court survey is ordered, the clerk is without authority to tax the surveyor's fees in the bill of costs, but on appeal from the clerk's order, the superior court,

                        review portion of the case, in contested cases arising under Article 3 of Chapter 150B, to be taxed as court costs against the appropriate agency if:

                        The legislature, in enacting this section, obviously sought to curb unwarranted, ill-supported suits initiated by State agencies. Crowell Constructors, Inc. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 838</cite>, 467 S.E.2d 675 (1996).

                        Applicability. - State agency's claim that attorneys' fees were not warranted in an employment matter failed because (1) G.S. 126-34.02(e) authorized the award, and (2) fees were not awarded under G.S. 6-19.1. Hunt v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety,

                        G.S. 6-19.1 authorizes a superior court to award fees to the employee of a county Department of Social Services who has prevailed under the State Personnel Act, G.S. 126-1 et seq.; therefore, a trial court was authorized to award fees for representation
                        of a plaintiff during the administrative proceedings contesting her termination while on medical leave, which was adjudged without cause and wrongful. Early v. County of Durham Dep't of Soc. Servs.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 616 S.E.2d 553 (2005).

                    <p>
                        By amending the statute to provide specifically for recovery of attorneys' fees incurred in the administrative review portions of North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act, Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite>,
                        cases, and omitting any mention of the administrative review portions of Article 3A cases, the legislature revealed its intent not to provide for recovery of attorneys' fees incurred in disciplinary actions by licensing boards.
                        Winkler v. N.C. State Bd. of Plumbing, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 819 S.E.2d 105 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When read as a whole and based on the legislative history of the statute, the language "a disciplinary action by a licensing board" was intended to exclude such actions from the purview of the statute. Winkler v. N.C. State Bd. of Plumbing,
                        <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 819 S.E.2d 105 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Words "other than" exclude from the broader class of "any civil actions" certain specified actions listed immediately after the words "other than," and the phrase "an adjudication for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate" is modified by the exclusionary
                        words of "other than"; it follows that the exclusionary words also modify the phrase "a disciplinary action by a licensing board," which similarly begins with a singular indefinite article. Winkler v. N.C. State Bd. of Plumbing,
                        <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 819 S.E.2d 105 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By using the last comma to separate the phrase "disciplinary action by a licensing board" from the phrase "brought by the State," the legislature extended the statutory exclusion to disciplinary actions. Winkler v. N.C. State Bd. of Plumbing,
                        <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 819 S.E.2d 105 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Syntax of the statute, i.e., the phrase "in any civil action brought by the State," is separate and distinct from the phrase "other than an adjudication for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate, or a disciplinary action by a licensing board";
                        this distinction exists as a means of delineating what is and is not within the scope of the statute and supports the interpretation of disciplinary actions as being categorized with the other exception to the statute. Winkler
                        v. N.C. State Bd. of Plumbing, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 819 S.E.2d 105 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the phrase "a disciplinary action by a licensing board" is designated with the indefinite article "a," and is separated from the rest of the statute by way of commas, the plain language of the statute conveys the legislature's intent to exclude
                        disciplinary actions by licensing boards from the purview of the statute. Winkler v. N.C. State Bd. of Plumbing, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 819 S.E.2d 105 (2018).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Disciplinary Actions by Licensing Boards Excluded from Statute. - Use of the word "any" before the phrase "civil action" differentiates the phrase from the two phrases following "other than," an adjudication for the purpose of establishing or fixing a
                        rate and a disciplinary action by a licensing board, each introduced with a singular indefinite article, respectively "an" and "a"; he singular indefinite articles convey that rate cases and licensing board actions are separate
                        and distinct members of the class of "any civil action," and therefore are excluded. Winkler v. N.C. State Bd. of Plumbing, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 819 S.E.2d 105 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        G.S. 6-19.1 did not preclude a trial court from awarding attorney's fees in disciplinary actions by a licensing board where although no plain meaning emerged due to the misplacement of commas, such disciplinary actions were not civil in nature, and thus,
                        the General Assembly could not have intended to except them from the category of civil actions. Winkler v. N.C. State Bd. of Plumbing, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 726</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 206 (2020).
                    </p>

                        Awarding a licensee attorney's fees pursuant to G.S. 6-19.1 was error where the North Carolina State Board of Plumbing, Heating, &amp; Fire Sprinkler Contractors' arguments that the licensee's actions to a pool heating system constituted restoration were
                        not irrational or illegitimate in light of the facts, and thus, despite failing to prevail on the merits of its claim, the Board was substantially justified in contending that the licensee engaged in the type of conduct the Board
                        was authorized to discipline. Winkler v. N.C. State Bd. of Plumbing, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 726</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 206 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Discretionary Decision. - In a dispute involving a driveway, attorney fees were properly not awarded because, assuming that the trial court erred by concluding that the North Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) acted with substantial justification,
                        it also denied the award of fees in its discretion; an argument that the trial court was required to award attorney fees if the DOT acted without substantial justification and no special circumstances existed that made an award
                        of attorney's fees unjust was rejected. Because there was no argument on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award attorney's fees, any such argument was abandoned. High Rock Lake Partners, LLC v. N.C.
                        DOT, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 760 S.E.2d 750 (2014).

                        Services Performed Prior to Judicial Review. - This section allows for an award of attorney's fees in State Personnel Commission cases only for services rendered on judicial review, not for services performed prior to judicial review. Morgan v. North

                        Motion Timely. - Petitioner's motion for attorney's fees, filed well before final judgment, was timely; therefore, the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Whiteco Indus., Inc. v. Harrelson, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite>                        815, 434 S.E.2d 229 (1993); Whiteco Indus., Inc. v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C.

                    <p>
                        Motion Untimely. - Trial court lacked jurisdiction to award attorney's fees because an employee did not file his motion within 30 days of the final disposition of his case against the North Carolina Department of Transportation; because a petition is
                        a formal written application to a court requesting judicial action on a certain matter, a request for attorney's fees contained within a complaint's prayer for relief does not constitute a "petition" within the meaning of G.S.
                        6-19.1(2). Hodge v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 726, 589 S.E.2d 737 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 234</cite>, 595 S.E.2d 151 (2004).

                        Superior court was time barred under G.S. 6-19.1 from considering the attorney's petition for attorney's fees where the statute required the attorney to petition for fees within the 30-day time frame following final disposition of the underlying action;
                        the attorney did not make his petition for well over a year from that date. McIntyre v. Forsyth County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 589 S.E.2d 745 (2004), cert. denied,

                        Findings of Fact Required. - Although the award of attorney's fees is within the discretion of the trial judge under this section, the trial court must make findings of fact as to the time and labor expended, the skill required, the customary fee for
                        like work, and the experience or ability of the attorney. North Carolina Dep't of Cors. v. Harding, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 462 S.E.2d 671 (1995).

                        of fact about the reasonableness of the award of attorney fees to enable the court of appeals to determine whether the award was within the trial court's sound discretion or was an abuse thereof. Kelly v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp;

                        Trial court did not exceed its jurisdiction by addressing attorney's fees issue because "final disposition" for purposes of G.S. 6-19.1 had not yet occurred in the case and would not occur until the supreme court either declined to grant discretionary
                        review of the decision of the court of appeals or until any proceedings resulting from supreme court review of its order concluded, and, as a result, the fact that a company had not yet filed a formal petition of the type contemplated
                        by G.S. 6-19.1 stood as no obstacle to its ability to seek attorney's fees from the Secretary of Crime Control and Public Safety, particularly given the trial court's decision to require the company to file such a petition after
                        the conclusion of all appellate proceedings in the case; a superior court judge reviewing administrative action on a de novo basis is entitled to award attorney's fees during the judicial review process even though "final disposition"

                        court had jurisdiction to consider the attorney's fees issue despite the lack of a "final disposition" or a formal petition, particularly since the amount of the award would be determined upon the "final disposition" of the case
                        and since the trial court had ordered that a "petition" of the type specified in G.S. 6-19.1 be filed prior to the entry of an actual attorney's fee award.

                        Substantial Justification. - In order to further the legislature's purpose of reining in wanton, unfounded litigation, the State's action for purposes of this section is measured by the phrase "substantial justification". Thus, the agency is required
                        to demonstrate that its position, at and from the time of its initial action, was rational and legitimate to such degree that a reasonable person could find it satisfactory or justifiable in light of the circumstances then known
                        to the agency. Crowell Constructors, Inc. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 838</cite>, 467 S.E.2d 675 (1996).

                        Where stockpiles of sand as high as 25 feet tall were placed upon surface soil and 24 years later the sand was covered with new surface soil which grew vegetation, including pine trees, the Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources (now
                        the Department of Environment and Natural Resources) was not "without substantial justification" in its position that the landowner was engaged in mining by removing the sand. Crowell Constructors, Inc. v. State,

                        The respondent was without "substantial justification" for denying the petitioner's retirement benefits and the trial court, therefore, reasonably awarded the petitioner attorney's fees pursuant to this section. The respondent accepted the petitioner's
                        contributions after she began to take half year leaves of absence as part of a job sharing agreement and continued to represent to her that she was a full-fledged member of the retirement system until she prepared to collect her

                        Trial court did not err in awarding attorney's fees to a company under G.S. 6-19.1 because the decision of the Secretary of Crime Control and Public Safety to assess an additional overweight penalty against the company was substantially justified, and
                        although the Secretary erroneously assessed a separate overweight penalty against the company, since the Secretary showed that its action was not without substantial justification, he was not liable for attorney's fees. Daily Express,

                        Department of Health and Human Services rested on the plain meaning of the relevant statutory provisions and even if the appellate court declined to accept the interpretation of the statutory language advanced by DHHS, it would have reached the conclusion
                        that the agency's refusal to acquiesce in the husband's interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions rested on a reasonable view of the controlling legal authorities. As a result, the appellate court was unable to agree
                        with the trial court that the DHHS' position lacked substantial justification; thus, an award of attorney fees to the wife was improper. Joyner v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 278,

                        When the trial court found plaintiff in contempt under G.S. 5A-21, it erred in awarding attorney fees to defendant as sanctions; such an award was not authorized by statute, as G.S. 6-18 and G.S. 6-20, governing costs, did not apply to a contempt proceeding.

                        But Attorney's Fees Permissible. - Although neither the provisions of G.S. 6-18 or this section are applicable to an action for civil contempt a trial court may properly award attorney's fees to a plaintiff who prevails in a civil contempt action. The
                        Appellate Court has approved the allowance of attorney's fees in contempt actions where such fees were expressly authorized by statute as in the case of child support.

                        Award of Costs Discretionary, Not Mandatory. - Where plaintiff took voluntary dismissal, and then refiled, defendants were not entitled to expert witness fees, deposition transcripts, court reporter fees, or attorney travel costs under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 41(a); assuming, arguendo, that all the expenses denied by the trial court were recoverable as common law costs under
                        G.S. 6-20, such an award was permissive, not mandatory. Cosentino v. Weeks, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 586 S.E.2d 787 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Negligence cases were not listed among the types of actions in which costs had to be awarded to a prevailing party pursuant to either G.S. 6-18 or G.S. 6-19; therefore, the trial court's costs ruling was governed by G.S. 6-20, and costs could be allowed
                        or not, in the discretion of the court. Smith v. Cregan, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 632 S.E.2d 206 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Previously under G.S. 6-20 (prior to its amendment by Session Laws 2007-212, s. 2), an award of costs was left to the discretion of the court; although deposition costs were not specifically enumerated, they were common law costs that could be awarded
                        under G.S. 6-20. While there was divergent case law with respect to whether deposition costs were recoverable, an employee had not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding deposition costs to the prevailing
                        party. McDonnell v. Tradewind Airlines, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 674, 670 S.E.2d 302 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 128</cite>, 675 S.E.2d 657 (2009).

                        Discretion Not Reviewable. - By this section the taxing of costs is placed in the discretion of the trial judge, which discretion is not reviewable. Kluttz v. Allison, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 379</cite>, 199 S.E. 395 (1938);

                        Taxation of costs against the plaintiff is within the court's discretion and is not reviewable on appeal, the action being equitable in nature. Bumgarner &amp; Bowman Bldrs. v. Hollar, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 14,

                        Trial court's taxing costs of costs to an injured party under G.S. 6-20 was not reviewable on appeal as the trial court specifically stated that the costs were awarded in the trial court's discretion. Griffis v. Lazarovich,
                        <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 595 S.E.2d 797 (2004).

                        Appellate court did not review a trial court's decision to award costs as that award was made in the trial court's discretion. Castle McCulloch, Inc. v. Freedman, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 610 S.E.2d 416 (2005),

                    <p>
                        Costs Discretionary in Actions of An Equitable Nature. - In equity there was a broad discretion on the subject of costs, Little v. Lockman, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. 433</cite> (1858), and the allowance rested with the court.
                        Worthy v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 492</cite> (1885); Hooper v. Davies, <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. 236</cite>, 81 S.E. 1063 (1914).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even since the abolition of the courts of equity in this State, it is held that where the case partakes of an equitable nature, the question of costs is in the court's discretion. Thus where the jury found that each party was entitled to an undivided
                        half in land, and the appeal was from taxing the defendant with costs, there being no element of an action in ejectment, neither party was permitted to recover costs from the other, especially as the question was of an equitable
                        nature, and the taxing of costs was, under this section, in the sound discretion of the court. Hare v. Hare, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 419</cite>, 111 S.E. 620 (1922).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In actions of an equitable nature the costs are in the discretion of the court. Yates v. Yates, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 533</cite>, 87 S.E. 317 (1915).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If an action is equitable in nature the taxing of the costs is within the discretion of the court, and the court may allow costs in favor of one party or the other or require the parties to share the costs. Hoskins v. Hoskins,

                        Taxing Costs in Personal Injury Cases. - Trial court did not err in taxing costs of defendant bakery company and its defendant driver to mother and minor son personal injury plaintiffs, as the bakery company and its driver were found not liable to the
                        mother and minor son and taxing the costs to them was done within the court's discretion under G.S. 6-20. Sterling v. Gil Soucy Trucking, Ltd., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite> 173, 552 S.E.2d

                        Although the trial court did not err when it awarded a pedestrian who was awarded $7,000 in damages after he was struck by a truck over $32,000 in attorneys' fees, it did err when it granted the pedestrian's request for reimbursement of costs he incurred
                        to make photocopies, telephone calls, photographs, trial diagrams and exhibits, and to obtain medical reports and records, because those expenses were not recoverable as costs, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsVIa28s7A-305" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-305</a></cite>.

                        Trial court erred in awarding numerous costs not authorized for medical reports, deposition costs, filing fees, travel costs, trial exhibits, color copies, and photocopies; there was statutory authority, however, for the following awards: mediation fees

                        Apportionment of Costs. - Where a jury found that the allegations of the complaint with respect to the maintenance of the nuisance were true, the trial court, when it ordered the personal property sold, had discretionary power with respect to the apportionment
                        of the costs. State ex rel. Morris v. Shinn, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 88</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 244 (1964).

                        Because plaintiff's legal fees and other costs were not recoverable as independent damages on a fraud claim, and he did not allege that he suffered any other damage, he failed to prove that he suffered legally cognizable damages as a result of a misrepresentation
                        by defendant. Under North Carolina law, a successful litigant could not recover attorneys' fees, whether as costs or as an item of damages, unless such a recovery was expressly authorized by statute, and costs were recoverable
                        only in certain listed types of cases, none of which applied, or at the discretion of the court to a prevailing party, which necessarily meant establishing a prima facie case that, in the context of fraud, had to include independent
                        damages aside from costs. Hoch v. Hoch (In re Hoch), - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Jan. 25, 2018).

                        A consolidated action, tried before the referee, in which judgments are rendered, is not an equitable proceeding, in which costs may be allowed or not, in the discretion of the court under this section. Highland Cotton Mills v. Ragan Knitting Co.,

                        Creditor's Bill. - It is within the discretion of the trial court to tax the costs accruing upon either of the parties litigant, in an action in the nature of a creditor's bill, brought by materialmen, claiming under the statutory lien, the unpaid balance
                        due by the owner of a dwelling, etc., to his contractor for its erection; and the action of the judge in taxing the trust funds in the owner's hands with the cost is commended in this suit. Bond v. Pickett Cotton Mills, Inc.,

                        Specific Performance Generally. - Where the purpose of an action was simply to compel the specific performance of an executory contract, and to adjust certain rights involved in an account of moneys collected and certain indebtedness incident to that
                        contract, it was clearly within this section. Parton v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 422</cite>, 10 S.E. 490 (1889).

                        Where one of the defendants in an injunction suit seeks affirmative relief by way of specific performance, the taxing of costs is in the discretion of the trial court, since the controversy is of an equitable nature. Consequently the order of the court
                        apportioning the costs will not ordinarily be disturbed on appeal upon affirmance of the judgment. Chandler v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 62</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 528, 3 A.L.R.2d 571 (1948).

                        Setting Aside Proceedings of Probate Court. - Where the action is to set aside certain proceedings in the probate court, the court is vested with discretion in the matter of allowing costs, under this section; each party is ordered to pay his own and
                        each to pay one half of the allowance to the referee. Gulley v. Macy, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 343</cite> (1883).

                        Deposition Expenses. - As a general rule, recoverable costs may include deposition expenses unless it appears that the depositions were unnecessary. Even though deposition expenses do not appear expressly in the statutes they may be considered as part
                        of "costs" and taxed in the trial court's discretion. Dixon, Odom &amp; Co. v. Sledge, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 280, 296 S.E.2d 512 (1982); Alsup v. Pitman, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite>                        389, 390 S.E.2d 750 (1990).

                        Award of costs made to an engineering firm, after a trial court granted the firm a directed verdict, was modified to remove the award of deposition costs because, while <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsVIa28s7A-305" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-305</a></cite>                        permitted the court to award the firm costs for mediation fees, expert witness fees, and service of process fees for trial subpoenas, it did not grant the court statutory authority to award the deposition costs.

                        When, in a personal injury case, a trial court ruled that it did not have discretion to tax a landowner's deposition costs against alleged injured parties, this was error, as the trial court had such discretion under G.S. 6-20, so the trial court's judgment
                        was reversed to allow it to exercise this discretion. Walden v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 673, 635 S.E.2d 616 (2006).

                        Costs were properly allowed to a successful driver even though the driver's insurer paid all of his costs, as: (1) the judgment was entered for the driver and the costs award did not violate G.S. 6-1; (2) the driver incurred the expenses; (3) the award

                        Cost of an Independent Appraiser's Valuation Report - The trial court acted within its discretion when it taxed the entire cost of an independent appraiser's valuation report to the defendants/majority stockholders of a closely-held corporation, as allowed
                        under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-305(d)</a></cite>, and ignored or effectually amended the court's pre-trial case management order,

                        Line of decisions from the North Carolina Court of Appeals holding that trial courts have broad authority under G.S. 6-20 to tax any expenses deemed "reasonable and necessary" were not consistent with the context and plain meaning of G.S. 6-20 or with

                        a trial court's authority concerning tax costs to those expenses specifically statutorily authorized, and the North Carolina General Statutes did not explicitly authorize a trial court to tax expenses related to trial exhibits.

                            Attorneys' Fees Generally. - Ordinarily attorneys' fees are taxable as costs only when expressly authorized by statute. Horner v. Chamber of Commerce, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 96</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 21 (1952). For note

                            This section authorizes attorneys' fees in certain enumerated actions to be taxed as a part of the costs, to be paid out of the fund which is the subject matter of the action. Rider v. Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 632</cite>,
                            78 S.E.2d 745 (1953).

                            Attorneys' Fees and Costs in Drainage Law. - Assuming that G.S. 105-374(i) is incorporated by reference into <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.156.html" target="_blank">Chapter 156</a></cite>, because the section
                            provides for attorneys' fees for taxing authorities does not mean that it prohibits attorneys' fees being taxed as part of the costs for members of drainage districts. Northampton County Drainage Dist. Number One v. Bailey,
                            <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 742</cite>, 392 S.E.2d 352 (1990).

                            This section provides for an award of costs in all actions under the drainage chapter and authorizes award of attorneys' fees to members of drainage district in action brought by district seeking to collect unpaid assessments and G.S. 105-374(i) even
                            if incorporated by reference into <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.156.html" target="_blank">Chapter 156</a></cite> does not prohibit attorneys' fees from being taxed as part of the
                            costs for members of drainage districts. Northampton County Drainage Dist. Number One v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 742</cite>, 392 S.E.2d 352 (1990).

                            Jurisdiction to Award Fees After Appeal Filed. - The trial court lacked jurisdiction to award attorney fees to the trust settlor's adopted grandchildren after the settlor's natural grandchildren filed an appeal of the judgment deciding that the adopted
                            grandchildren were entitled to share in distribution of the trust. Gibbons v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 777, 513 S.E.2d 834 (1999).

                            As to the difference between including attorneys' fees in the costs taxed against a party to a lawsuit and in ordering the payment of attorneys' fees, see Smith v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 523</cite>, 340 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            Application in Trade Secrets Cases. - Trial court's denial of defendants' motion for attorney fees was proper in a trade secrets case because attorney fees may have been awarded to the prevailing party if a claim of misappropriation was made in bad faith
                            or if willful and malicious misappropriation existed regardless of the language of G.S. 6-21. Bruning &amp; Federle Mfg. Co. v. Mills, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 153, 647 S.E.2d 672
                            (2007), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 86</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 837 (2007).

                        <p>
                            Appropriate Under the UTMA. - In a judgment removing the father as custodian of all accounts created under the North Carolina Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, G.S. 33A-1 et seq., an award of attorney fees was proper because the legislative history of
                            the uniform UTMA statute indicated that custodial accounts under UTMA were to be regarded as a form of statutory trust. Thus, there existed statutory authority under G.S. 6-21(2) for an award of attorney's fees in an action
                            for the removal of a custodian and for an accounting and determination of personal liability under UTMA. Belk v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 728 S.E.2d 356 (2012).

                            Judicial Review. - The exercise of the court's discretionary authority is not reviewable. Hoskins v. Hoskins, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 704</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 326 (1962); Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C.

                        <p>
                            The decision to award counsel fees is within the discretion of the trial court, and the Court of Appeals will not disturb what it deems to be a sound exercise of that discretion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the findings of the superior court regarding an award of attorney's fees in a caveat proceeding are supported by the evidence the reviewing court cannot disturb them. Dyer v. State, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 374</cite>,

                            Costs Properly Denied. - Trial court did not err in failing to assess costs against the daughters because nothing of record in the appeal gave rise to an inference that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to tax the costs of the action against
                            the daughters, who were the prevailing parties; the daughters' success on the merits belied the assertion that maintenance of their claims was improper. Harris v. Gilchrist, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite>                            67, 785 S.E.2d 119 (2016), review denied, 793 S.E.2d 223, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 846 (2016).

                            Discretion of Court. - It is within the discretionary power of the court before which an issue of devisavit vel non is tried to direct the payment of the costs out of the estate. Mayo v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. 406</cite>                            (1878). See In re Will of Hargrove, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 307</cite>, 173 S.E. 577 (1934), for dicta on this point.

                        <p>
                            Subdivision (2) of this section leaves the taxing of court costs and the apportionment thereof to be made in the discretion of the court. Moreover, the fixing of reasonable attorneys' fees in applicable cases is likewise a matter within the sound discretion
                            of the trial court. Godwin v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 520</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 456 (1963).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where appellant did not contend that the fees allowed counsel were unreasonable and nothing to the contrary appeared in the record, it was taken that the court taxed the costs and attorneys' fees in the exercise of its discretion and that there was no
                            abuse of this discretion. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Dodson, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 22</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 875 (1963).

                        <p>
                            When an executor's right to qualify is contested and judicially denied, whether the court will exercise its discretion to award costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred in his unsuccessful litigation, will depend in each case upon the grounds for the
                            opposition and the reasonableness of his resistance to it, his good faith in pressing his appointment and whether his efforts were in the interest of the estate. In re Estate of Moore, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 58</cite>,
                            231 S.E.2d 849 (1977).

                        <p>
                            Albeit subdivision (2) authorizes the trial judge in his discretion to award costs, including attorneys' fees, in the instances specified therein, it is quite clear (1) that he should not award costs and attorneys' fees to an executor-designate whose
                            claim for appointment is rejected unless the claim was reasonable, made in good faith and prima facie in the interest of the estate; and (2) that the judge has no discretion to tax costs against an estate when the nominated
                            executor was disqualified to act as a matter of law. Estate of Moore, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 58</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 849 (1977).

                            Where a surviving spouse is forced to engage in litigation to determine whether a right of dissent from the will of the deceased spouse exists, the discretionary power given the trial judge under this section includes the power to award attorney's fees
                            for the surviving spouse when, in the opinion of the trial court, the proceeding was one of substantial merit. In re Kirkman, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 164</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 712 (1981).

                            Taxing of Costs Where Caveat Is Unsuccessful. - Under this section, even though judgment is entered in favor of propounders, the trial court may tax the costs, including an allowance to counsel representing caveators, against the estate upon finding that
                            the filing of the caveat was apt and proper and done in good faith. In re Will of Slade, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 361</cite>, 199 S.E. 290 (1938).

                            Same - Where Caveat Is Unsuccessful. - This statute authorizes the trial court in its discretion to allow attorneys' fees to counsel for unsuccessful caveators to a will. In re Will of Ridge, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite>                            183, 266 S.E.2d 766 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 375</cite>, 275 S.E.2d 424 (1981).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is a matter in the discretion of the court, both as to whether to allow attorneys' fees to counsel for unsuccessful caveators to a will and the amount of such fees. In re Will of Ridge, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite>                            183, 266 S.E.2d 766 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 375</cite>, 275 S.E.2d 424 (1981).

                        <p>
                            This section does not require the court to award attorneys' fees to counsel for unsuccessful caveators to a will, but clearly authorizes the court to do so; thus, it is a matter in the discretion of the court, both as to whether to allow fees and the
                            amount of such fees. In re Ridge, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 375</cite>, 275 S.E.2d 424 (1981).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            As long as a dissent has substantial merit, the court may exercise its discretion in awarding reasonable attorneys' fees. In re Estate of Tucci, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 408 S.E.2d 859 (1991), cert. dismissed,
                            <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 748</cite>, 417 S.E.2d 236 (1992).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The substantial merit requirement under subdivision (2) of this section does not mean success on the merits; in its sound discretion, the trial court may award attorneys' fees even to unsuccessful caveators. In re Estate of Tucci,
                            <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 408 S.E.2d 859 (1991), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 748</cite>, 417 S.E.2d 236 (1992).

                            Attorneys' Fees as Costs Paid by Executor. - The language of subdivision (2) of this section is sufficient to vest in the trial court the discretionary authority to tax reasonable attorneys' fees as a part of the costs to be paid by the executor. McWhirter
                            v. Downs, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 173 S.E.2d 587 (1970).

         Attorneys' Fees Fixed by Mutual Agreement Not Taxable Costs.
        </b> - Fees for services rendered by attorneys to the parties in a caveat to a will do not automatically become costs of the proceeding merely because they are incurred and paid. This section commits the allowance and
                            apportionment of the fees and the determination of the amounts thereof to the discretion of the court. Where the court had made no determination of the matter, but the amounts were fixed by contingent agreement between attorneys
                            and clients prior to suit and the allowance of the fees as part of the costs of the proceeding was intentionally excluded from the judgment of the court, the amounts paid to the attorneys did not and could not become part of
                            the taxable costs of the suit under this section. Commercial Nat'l Bank v. United States, 196 F.2d 182 (4th Cir. 1952).

                            Expense of Caveat Not Cost of Administration. - Costs of administration, as used in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html#t29a01s29-2" target="_blank">G.S. 29-2(5)</a></cite>, means those ordinary, usual, and
                            necessary expenses of administering a decedent's estate; a will caveat and its expense is neither of these, for a will caveat is a claim that the will involved is invalid, and its expense is a cost of court taxable against
                            either party, or apportioned among the parties, in the discretion of the court. In re Estate of Ward, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 660, 389 S.E.2d 441 (1990).

                            "Common Fund" Not Prerequisite to Award of Costs. - There is no requirement in subdivision (2) of this section that a "common fund be available before costs may be awarded." McNaull v. McNaull, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite>                            547, 380 S.E.2d 590, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 546</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 498 (1989).

                            No Authority to Award Fees Which Were Postponed Pending Retrial After Judgment Erroneously Set Aside. - Where the court's refusal to award attorneys' fees was based on its decision to postpone any award until the matter was retried, and the court erred
                            when it set aside the judgment and ordered a new trial, and since the appellate court directed that the consent judgment be reinstated, the trial court was without authority to order the payment of attorneys' fees as a part
                            of the costs of the caveat proceedings. In re Baity, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 309 S.E.2d 515 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 401</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 266

                            Standing to Stipulate to Payment of Attorneys' Fees. - Where estate was taxed with the payment of attorneys' fees pursuant to subdivision (2) of this section, the attorneys' fees were considered to be an item of costs, and since the clerk's order indicated
                            that the attorneys' fees should be paid directly to the law firm involved, and not to the dissenter, only the law firm could stipulate that the clerk's order had been satisfied. In re Estate of Tucci,

                            Award of Fees in Constructive Fraud and Breach of Fiduciary Duty Case. - Award of attorney's fees and trustee commissions upon the removal of a trustee for constructive fraud and breach of fiduciary duty was proper because the award was designed to restore
                            the trust to the same position it would have been in had no breach occurred and the awards fit the nature and gravity of the breach and the consequences to the beneficiaries and the trustee. Babb v. Graham,

                            Caveators Should Have Been Apprised of Court's Determination Regarding Fees. - Where the trial court permitted an attorney for all the named caveators to withdraw as counsel of record for certain caveators, implicit in that decision was permission for
                            these caveators to retain their own counsel; therefore, if at the outset of the trial, the court determined that there was duplicity on the part of all counsel in its representation of the caveators, then the caveators should
                            have been apprised that such a determination by the trial court might result in the denial of attorney fees pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, rather than for the trial court to summarily deny a successor law firm's
                            request for fees at the conclusion of the matter. Hill v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 424 S.E.2d 201 (1993).

                            Trial court did not err in denying a propounder's motion for attorney's fees and costs, because the court was not required to enter findings of fact on whether the propounder's position, although unsuccessful, was supported by substantial merit, under
                            G.S. 6-21; the statute required that prior to awarding attorney's fees to a caveator, the trial court had to make a finding of fact that the proceeding had substantial merit, under G.S. 6-21(2), but the statute did not require
                            the trial court make any such findings in the case of a propounder. In re Will of McDonald, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 577 S.E.2d 131 (2003).

                            Trial Court Abused Its Discretion. - The trial court abused its discretion by denying a petition of a law firm for approval and award of legal expenses where the trial court implicitly found that the caveat proceeding had substantial merit and where there
                            was evidence that the law firm performed substantial services on behalf of the caveators it represented. Hill v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 424 S.E.2d 201 (1993).

                            Basis for Award of Attorneys' Fees. - It was no error to affirm a clerk's award of attorneys' fees against a former co-trustee because (1) G.S. 36C-10-1004 and G.S. 6-21(2) did not limit a court's discretion to award fees to cases of egregious conduct,
                            and, (2) if egregious conduct were required, there was sufficient evidence of such conduct when the former co-trustee jeopardized the health of the trust by refusing to cooperate with efforts to sell or lease the trust property,

                            Where, in a suit to obtain advice and instruction of the court for the proper distribution of the assets of the estate, the cause is referred to a referee, the taxing of the referee's fee is within the discretion of the court, and order of the court prorating
                            the referee's fee between the funds derived from sale of realty to make assets and the personal property of the estate will not be disturbed. Williams v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 338</cite>,

                            Supreme Court, "that the defendants do recover against the plaintiff and the surety on his prosecution bond the costs of this action," did not preclude a subsequent trial judge from taxing the cost of reference against either

                            such recovery does not include compensation of the referee. Cody v. England, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 40</cite>, 19 S.E.2d 10 (1942).

                            Trial court abused the court's discretion by ordering a mother to pay a portion of a putative father's attorney's fees, once the putative father was proven not to be the biological father of the mother's child because, while costs, including attorney's
                            fees, were awardable under G.S. 6-21(10), the mother did not file the action to establish paternity and recover child support payments by an administrative agency, was not the real party in interest, and was compelled to participate
                            fully in the agency's action pursuant to G.S. 110-131, including naming the individual the mother believed was the child's biological father. Further, there was no showing that the mother named the putative father as the biological

                            an award of a "merit bonus." Even assuming such bonuses are allowed, as under federal practice, that should occur only in the "rare case" where the applicant specifically shows superior quality representation and exceptional

                            motorist's offer of judgment, which was less than the judgment finally obtained, (3) no findings of an unjust exercise of superior bargaining power, which did not require reversal in light of adequate findings on the whole
                            record supporting the award, (4) no findings of an unwarranted refusal to pay an insurance policy, which were not required as the suit involved an automobile accident and was not directly against an insurance policy, (5) the

                            G.S. 6-21.1 because the plain language gave the trial court discretion to award fees in negligence cases resulting in property damage where the award was $10,000 or less; the purchasers were awarded about $7,000 for servicing

                            notwithstanding the subsequent reduction of her judgment pursuant to G.S. 1B-4 by the amount of her settlement with a third-party defendant. Reinhold v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite>                            735, 606 S.E.2d 412 (2005).

                            Judgment awarding attorney fees pursuant to G.S. 6-21.1 following a verdict in a negligence action arising from a motor vehicle accident was affirmed. The trial court's order had specific findings as to the majority of the Washington factors, and the
                            trial court directly observed the attorneys, including their demeanor and characteristics. Wright v. Murray, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 155, 651 S.E.2d 913 (2007).

                            considered the entire record before making a decision. House v. Stone, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 594 S.E.2d 130 (2004).

                            "Presiding Judge" Means Judge Presiding over Court in Which Action Is Instituted. - The term "presiding judge" means the judge presiding over the court in which the action is instituted. Such judge can, without danger of injustice, fix a reasonable fee
                            for the attorney of the party recovering damages by settlement prior to trial. Hicks v. Albertson, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 236</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 40 (1973).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The legislature contemplated that the judge who presided at the trial would determine whether a fee for the attorney of the party recovering damages should be allowed and, if so, the amount. Such judge would be in a better position than any other to make
                            this determination. Hicks v. Albertson, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 236</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 40 (1973).

                            When Judge Other Than Trial Judge May Make Allowance. - While it is proper that the trial judge in an action which proceeds to trial may allow a reasonable attorney fee to the successful litigant under this section, the presiding judge of the court in
                            which the suit is instituted may allow such fee when judgment is obtained without the necessity for trial. In cases where the judge who presided at the trial is unable because of death, disability, or other valid reason to
                            make such allowance, the presiding judge of the court in which the suit is instituted would have such authority. Hicks v. Albertson, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 197 S.E.2d 624,

                            review the attorney's hours and determine the amount of fees to be awarded that represents, in the court's opinion, the legal fees to be awarded for obtaining a judgment whether from a complaint or a counterclaim. Mishoe v.

                            Because this statute defines the circumstances under which attorneys' fees may be awarded, the trial court is not required to make specific findings as to the plaintiff's entitlement to such an award.

                            A finding of an unwarranted refusal by defendants to pay plaintiff's claim is required only in suits by an insured or beneficiary against an insurance company. Yates Motor Co. v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite>                            339, 276 S.E.2d 496, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 320</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 660 (1981).

                            Where an insurance company is not a named defendant, there is no requirement that the trial court make a finding that there was an unwarranted refusal to pay by the insurer in order to award attorneys' fees under G.S. 6-21.1. McDaniel v. McBrayer,

                            When Finding of Unwarranted Refusal to Pay Not Required. - In a damage action arising out of a motor vehicle collision, since the suit was not on an insurance policy, a finding that refusal to pay was unwarranted was not required. Crisp v. Cobb,

                            The trial court was not required to make an "unwarranted refusal" finding to award attorney fees in an automobile accident case, since such a finding is required only in suits brought by an insured or a beneficiary against an insurance company defendant.

                            The trial court is to consider the entire record in properly exercising its discretion under this section, including but not limited to the following factors: (1) settlement offers made before institution of the action; (2) offers of judgment and whether
                            the judgment finally obtained was more favorable than such offers; (3) whether defendant unjustly exercised superior bargaining power; (4) in the case of an unwarranted refusal by an insurance company, the context in which
                            the dispute arose; (5) the timing of settlement offers; and (6) the amounts of the settlement offers as compared to the jury verdict. Washington v. Horton, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite>                            347, 513 S.E.2d 331 (1999).

                            When deciding whether to award attorneys' fees under G.S. 6-21.1, a trial court must examine the entire record, including but not limited to: (1) settlement offers made prior to institution of the action; (2) offers of judgment made pursuant to

                            In determining whether to award attorneys' fees, the trial court must consider the entire record, including: (1) settlement offers made prior to the institution of the action; (2) offers of judgment pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 68, and whether the judgment

                            Trial Court Failed to Appreciate the Significance of Settlement Offers. - The trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to counsel for plaintiff without considering the guidelines established by Horton; the trial court is required
                            to make additional findings of fact regarding the timing and amount of any settlement offers, the bargaining position of the parties, and the amount of the settlement offers as compared to the jury verdict. Culler v. Hardy,

                            Trial Court's Discretion. - Trial court's decision to award attorneys' fees under G.S. 6-21.1 is discretionary and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse of discretion. McDaniel v. McBrayer, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite>                            379, 595 S.E.2d 784 (2004).

                            No Fees Where Plaintiff Awarded New Trial. - Under this section, attorneys' fees are taxed as a part of the court costs, and where plaintiff was awarded a new trial by the appellate court, no judgment for damages was obtained, and, consequently, no attorneys'
                            fees would be awarded as part of the cost. Craven v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 287 S.E.2d 905 (1982).

                            Factors to Be Considered. - Several factors exist, denominated the "Washington factors," that a trial court must examine when determining whether to award attorney's fees. The trial court must consider the entire record in properly exercising its discretion,
                            including but not limited to the following factors: (1) settlement offers made prior to the institution of the action; (2) offers of judgment pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                            N.C. R. Civ. P. 68, and whether the judgment finally obtained was more favorable than such offers; (3) whether defendant unjustly exercised superior bargaining power; (4) in the case of an unwarranted refusal by an insurance
                            company, the context in which the dispute arose; (5) the timing of settlement offers; (6) the amounts of the settlement offers as compared to the jury verdict; and (7) the whole record.

                        <p>
                            Finding Insufficient to Award Attorneys' Fees. - Where the only findings of fact in support of the amount of the award for attorneys' fees were that plaintiff's attorney "provided good and valuable services"; that the reasonable value of the services
                            provided by plaintiff's attorney was $2,000.00; and that plaintiff's fee contract with her attorney provided for a contingent fee of one-third of the damage award, those findings were not sufficient to support an award of $2,000.
                            Epps v. Ewers, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 597, 369 S.E.2d 104 (1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The court abused its discretion in failing to make the required findings of fact to support the fee award pursuant to this section where no findings appear in the written judgment, and the hearing transcript reveals, at most, findings that a settlement
                            offer "right prior to trial" was rejected and no meaningful negotiations were held due to the parties' intransigence. Porterfield v. Goldkuhle, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 528

                        <p>
                            Award Upheld. - Where defendant's attorneys presented evidence tending to show that they were entitled to a fee of $8000 for their work, and the trial court, after having carefully reviewed petitioner's hours, awarded $5000, there was no abuse of discretion
                            in the award. Mickens v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 404 S.E.2d 359 (1991).

                        <p>
                            Attorney's fee award in a suit arising from an automobile accident was proper; although the jury's verdict was less than an offer of judgment, the offer did not exceed the amount of the judgment finally obtained, which included costs and attorney's fees.
                            Robinson v. Shue, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. App.</cite> 60, 550 S.E.2d 830 (2001).

                        <p>
                            Award Reversed. - The trial court erred in awarding $5,000 in attorney's fees to counsel for plaintiff after the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in the amount of $62; the court failed to consider the guidelines established by Washington v. Horton,
                            <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 347, 513 S.E.2d 331 (1999). Williams v. Manus, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 384, 542 S.E.2d 680 (2001).

                            Interest Not Allowed on Attorney Fee Awards. - There is no provision for interest on court costs, and since attorney fees are taxed as part of court costs under this section, the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment and postjudgment interest on an
                            award of attorney fees. Washington v. Horton, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 347, 513 S.E.2d 331 (1999).

                            Effect of Settlement or Offer. - To hold that use of the adjective "presiding" shows that the legislature intended that no fee be allowed in any case settled without actual trial is to give this word an unreasonably strict construction and would defeat
                            its purpose. Hicks v. Albertson, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 236</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 40 (1973).

                            This section refers specifically to the "institution" of a suit, not its trial, and allows an attorneys' fee to be awarded without regard to how that judgment is obtained. To permit an offer of judgment, or indeed any settlement prior to a completed trial,
                            to avoid the payment of a reasonable attorneys' fee in the discretion of the court would defeat in large measure the purpose of the statute. Hicks v.

                            Attorneys' fees and costs were properly awarded to the plaintiff, notwithstanding that the defendant twice offered to settle the action for $5,000, where the jury awarded the plaintiff $5,000, plus $555 in costs, and attorneys' fees were also taxed as
                            costs. Tew v. West, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 534, 546 S.E.2d 183 (2001).

                            Attorney's fees award was proper even though the tortfeasor made an offer of judgment which exceeded the jury's verdict because the jury's verdict was properly modified by adding the injured party's attorney's fees and costs in arriving at the "judgment

                            Amount of Settlement Irrelevant to Determination to Award Attorneys' Fees. - The amount of the final settlements in a civil suit was irrelevant in determining whether to award attorneys' fees. Epps v. Ewers, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                            597, 369 S.E.2d 104 (1988).

                            Offer of Judgment Exceeding $5,000. - An offer of judgment for more than $5,000, together with costs then accrued, but excluding attorneys' fees, is valid. This section would not apply in this case and "costs then accrued" would therefore not include
                            attorneys' fees incurred after the offer of judgment was made. The mere fact that judgment for less than $5,000 is later obtained should have no bearing on costs accrued at the time the offer was made. The trial judge would
                            have had no discretion to award an attorneys' fee, even if the defendant had not inserted language excluding them in his offer of judgment. Purdy v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 93</cite>,

                            Refusal of Reasonable Settlement Offer May Affect Award of Attorney's Fees. - Where a substantial settlement offer was made well before trial, and that offer was increased through negotiations to an amount more than four times that recovered by plaintiff
                            at trial, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff's request for attorney's fees under this section. Blackmon v. Bumgardner, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 125,

                            The fact that third party plaintiff ultimately agreed to accept a judgment for less than the amount offered her by third party defendants' insurance carrier before plaintiff's suit and her cross-claim were filed did not ipso facto deny her the benefit
                            of this section, and the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in awarding a reasonable attorneys' fee to third party plaintiff in her action against third party defendant. Yates Motor Co. v. Simmons,
                            <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 276 S.E.2d 496, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 320</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 660 (1981).

                            Attorneys' Fees Allowed. - Where there is a clear indication in the record that an application for attorneys' fees as a part of the costs was to be considered by the court, and the settlement was effected with knowledge of this proposed application, allowance
                            should be made for fees. Hicks v. Albertson, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 197 S.E.2d 624, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 236</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 40 (1973).

                        <p>
                            Fee Is Allowed as Part of Costs. - This section does not provide for the recovery of a reasonable attorneys' fee in addition to the court costs but "as a part of the court costs." Where the acceptance by the plaintiff of an offer of judgment for a specified
                            sum plus "costs" proceeded from a reasonable interpretation by the plaintiff that "costs" included attorneys' fees, then if such interpretation was not intended by the defendant, the misunderstanding was due to ambiguous language
                            used by the defendant in making his offer and the defendant must bear any loss resulting therefrom. Hicks v. Albertson, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 236</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 40 (1973).

                        <p>
                            If a party wishes to avoid payment of attorneys' fees in cases in which this section may be applicable, he should make his offer of settlement before the suit is instituted. Hicks v. Albertson, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite>                            599, 197 S.E.2d 624, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 236</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 40 (1973).

                            There was no unwarranted refusal to settle where insurance company settled within four months of the accident and for a reasonable amount, as evidenced by the similarity between the jury verdict and the settlement amount. Benton v. Thomerson,

                        Section Not Applicable for Recovery upon Default of Purchase Money Deed of Trust. - This section deals in general and comprehensive terms with the propriety of attorneys' fees arising from the collection of indebtedness and, therefore, was not controlling
                        in a case in which a seller of real property had accepted a purchase money deed of trust from his buyer and then sought recovery upon default; <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.045.html#t45a2Bs45-21.38" target="_blank">G.S. 45-21.38</a></cite>                        deals with just such a particular situation.

                        This section does not apply to arbitration proceedings; thus, in arbitration proceedings, both the arbitrator or arbitration panel and the superior courts upon confirmation are limited to applying only former G.S. 1-567.11 in determining whether attorneys'
                        fees should be or were properly awarded. Nucor Corp. v. General Bearing Corp., <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 148</cite>, 423 S.E.2d 747 (1992), reh'g denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 349</cite>, 426

                        Statute Inapplicable To Trustee's Attorney's Fees. - G.S. 6-21.2 is inapplicable to trustee's attorney's fees because the trustee is an agent of both the debtor and the creditor, and G.S. 6-21.2 governs only attorney's fees for the creditor's attorney;
                        accordingly, if the deed of trust calls for "reasonable" attorney's fees then the trustee should distribute a reasonable amount under the circumstances. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust of Vogler Realty, Inc.,

                        Attorneys' Fees of Purchase Money Creditor Not Secured Obligation. - Where a promissory note states on its face that it is "given as purchase money, and is secured by a purchase money deed of trust," and the note is incorporated by reference into the
                        deed of trust, attorneys' fees are not part of the purchase price. Hence, even if the trustee were to foreclose on the purchase money deed of trust, the purchase money creditor's attorneys' fees would not be a secured obligation.

                        Attorneys' fees provided for in an agreement to settle litigation already underway were not "obligations to pay attorneys' fees upon any note . . . or other evidence of indebtedness" under this section. Without undermining the intent or force of this

                        Attorneys' Fees Provisions Enforceable When Specifically Authorized. - Although provisions calling for a debtor to pay attorneys' fees incurred by a creditor in the collection of a debt have long been considered against public policy, such provisions

                        Specific Percentage Not Specified in Unsecured Promissory Note. - Where an unsecured promissory note provided for the payment of reasonable attorneys' fees upon default by the debtor, without specifying any specific percentage, the trial court properly
                        allowed the plaintiff to recover as reasonable attorneys' fees 15% of the balance due on the note, as provided by this section. Binning's, Inc. v. Roberts Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite>                        569, 177 S.E.2d 1 (1970).

                        In looking to whether creditor's claim for prepetition attorneys' fees as part of an unsecured claim would be disallowed pursuant to any agreement or applicable law, the court interpreted a provision of North Carolina law governing fee awards where there
                        was a contractual agreement to pay reasonable fees that did not specify any percentage to require looking at evidence of reasonableness, up to a statutory cap of 15 percent. However, even assuming arguendo that the language "reasonable
                        attorneys' fees" entitled creditor to a statutory award of 15 percent, the allowance of claims in bankruptcy was controlled by federal law, and the court exercised its equitable power to disallow a per se award of 15 percent in
                        this case as unreasonable. In re Yow, - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Jan. 18, 2019).

                        Creditor was not entitled to a portion of its attorney fees from a sale of bankruptcy debtors' real property since the amount of the debt to the creditor exceeded the maximum amount of advances allowable under the security interest in the real property
                        which was granted by the debtors; thus, the creditor was only secured by the real property to the maximum amount of allowed advances and could only recover fees from the sale of the property in proportion to the extent of its security

                        waive all or part of the additional damages upon a finding that the defendant's failure to satisfy the dishonored check or draft was due to economic hardship.

                    contained identification information which was used to identify you as the maker of the check. Also, we have received no information that this was a stolen check, if that is the circumstance. The check has been dishonored by the bank

                </p>
                <p>
                    Payment of the total amount claimed above within 30 days of the mailing of this letter shall satisfy this civil remedy for the returned check.

                <p>
                    If payment has not been received within this 30-day period, we will seek appropriate relief before a court of proper jurisdiction for full payment of the check plus all costs, treble damages, and witness fees.

                        Merit Bonus. - It is true that the quality of services rendered is properly considered in awarding fees, as well as the nature of the services required, and hence the scope and complexity of the case. However, there is no North Carolina authority for
                        an award of a "merit bonus." Even assuming such bonuses are allowed, as under federal practice, that should occur only in the "rare case" where the applicant specifically shows superior quality representation and exceptional success.

                <p>
                    In any civil action, special proceeding, or estate or trust proceeding, the court, upon motion of the prevailing party, may award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party if the court finds that there was a complete absence of a justiciable
                    issue of either law or fact raised by the losing party in any pleading. The filing of a general denial or the granting of any preliminary motion, such as a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to

                    evidence to support the court's decision to make such an award. A party who advances a claim or defense supported by a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of law may not be required under this section to
                    pay attorney's fees. The court shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its award of attorney's fees under this section.

                        The purpose of this statute is not served by treating those who bring frivolous suits against indigent parties differently from those who bring frivolous suits against parties who can afford to retain their own counsel; therefore, the trial court's limitation

                        because it was not a prevailing party due to the voluntary dismissal; unlike this section, which allowed fees at any stage to discourage frivolous litigation, G.S. 75-16.1 encouraged private enforcement of the Unfair and Deceptive
                        Practices Act. Jenkins v. Moses H. Cone Mem'l Health Servs. Corp., - F. Supp. 2d - (E.D.N.C. Oct. 23, 2015).

                        Absence of Justiciable Issue. - To recover attorneys' fees under G.S. 6-21.5, the party claiming attorney fees must be the "prevailing party," and there must be "a complete absence of a justiciable issue of either law or fact raised by the losing party
                        in any pleading." Bryson v. Sullivan, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 401 S.E.2d 645 (1991), modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 644</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 327 (1992).

                    <p>
                        The mere filing of an affirmative defense without more is not sufficient to establish the absence of a justiciable issue, nor is the grant of a <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                        Rule 12(b)(6) motion, nor the entry of summary judgment. These events may only be evidence of the absence of a justiciable issue. However, action by the losing party which perpetuated litigation in the face of events substantially
                        establishing that the pleadings no longer presented a justiciable controversy may also serve as evidence for purposes of G.S. 6-21.5. Sunamerica Fin. Corp. v. Bonham, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 254</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 435 (1991).

                        Attorney's fees award was proper under G.S. 6-21.1, although the operator's attorney's fees exceeded the actual damages, as the judgment entered for an operator, including prejudgment interest under G.S. 24-5(b), was below the $ 10,000 threshold; unlike
                        G.S. 6-21.5, did not require that there be an absence of a justiciable issue of law or fact. Bryson v. Cort, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 532, 668 S.E.2d 84 (2008).

                        of attorneys fees; it was in furtherance of the policy of the statute to discourage frivolous litigation, and as the prevailing party, plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys fees at the discretion of the trial court. McLennan v.

                        With regard to determining whether attorneys' fees may be awarded under this section, the first issue is whether the pleading, when read in conjunction with all the responsive pleadings, facially presents a justiciable issue of law. If not, the second

                        these facts the trial court could have found that such frivolous litigation constitutes a reckless waste of judicial resources as well as the time and money of the prevailing litigants. Sunamerica Fin. Corp. v. Bonham,

                        Where a contractor unsuccessfully asserted claims against a surety for bad faith and deceptive trade practices based on the surety's status as an insurer, the contractor's claims, although weak, were not frivolous, and the surety was not entitled to an
                        award of attorney fees; the distinction between a relationship of insurance and a relationship of suretyship was an unsettled area of state law, and a finding that the one state case on point was determined to be controlling did
                        not render the contractor's claims contrary to settled law. Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Dynamic Dev. Group, LLC, 336 F. Supp. 2d 552 (M.D.N.C. 2004).

                        liable for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, an award of attorney fees to the corporation was not warranted since the officer's reasonable belief that the agreements were valid precluded a finding that there was no justiciable

                        Trial court did not err in denying an airport authority and its members attorney fees under G.S. 6-21.5 because a corporation and its owner did not unreasonably continue to litigate some of their claims through trial, and although the trial court ultimately
                        granted the authority and its members a directed verdict, there was nothing until that point indicating to the corporation and owner that no justiciable issue existed; denial of a motion to dismiss addressing only whether the complaint's
                        allegations state a claim for relief does not preclude a determination that the actual facts, as opposed to the allegations, are not sufficient to raise a justiciable issue, and in contrast at the summary judgment stage the question
                        is whether the non-movant has presented sufficient evidence to give rise to a genuine issue of fact on the material issues in the case and keep the case moving forward to the fact finder. Free Spirit Aviation, Inc. v. Rutherford

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants' motion for attorney's fees pursuant to G.S. 6-21.5 because plaintiff did not persist in litigating the case after a point where she should reasonably have become aware that the pleading she
                        filed no longer contained a justiciable issue; although the trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, there was not a complete absence of a justiciable issue of either law or fact, and because the trial court
                        denied defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings after receiving an amended complaint and answer, it necessarily did not find plaintiff's claims to lacked merit.

                        Prevailing Party. - Trial court erred in denying buyers' motion for attorney's fees on the ground that the buyers were not prevailing parties because the buyers' prevailed on a contractor's claims, and the contractor prevailed on their counterclaim; a
                        "prevailing party" under G.S. 6-21.5 was a party who prevailed on a claim or issue in an action, not a party who prevailed in the action, and attorney's fees are available under G.S. 6-21.5 against any party who raises an issue
                        in which there is a complete absence of a justiciable issue of either law or fact. Persis Nova Constr. v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 671 S.E.2d 23 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Because G.S. 6-21.5 is unambiguous in providing that attorney's fees may be awarded against the "losing party in any pleading," by the plain language of the statute, attorney's fees may be awarded against more than one party in an action; in other words,
                        a "prevailing party," as used in G.S. 6-21.5, is a party who prevails on a claim or issue in an action, not a party who prevails in the action. Persis Nova Constr. v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite>                        55, 671 S.E.2d 23 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in denying defendants' motion for attorney fees under G.S. 143-318.16B because it mistakenly believed that it was required to designate either plaintiffs or defendants as the prevailing party and that it was not possible for both to
                        be prevailing parties, and even though the trial court had discretion whether to award fees, since it was acting under a misapprehension of law, it could not properly exercise that discretion; interpreting the phrase "prevailing
                        party" in G.S. 143-318.16B consistently with G.S. 6-21.5 requires the holding that more than one party, including both a plaintiff and a defendant in the same action, can be the prevailing party entitled to fees, and when the trial
                        court exercises its discretion under a misapprehension of the law it is appropriate to remand for reconsideration in light of the correct law. Free Spirit Aviation, Inc. v. Rutherford Airport Auth.,

                        Appeals. - Under a statute such as this section, which contains "prevailing party" requirement, the parties should not be required to litigate fees when the appeal could moot the issue. Furthermore, upon filing of a notice of appeal, a trial court in
                        North Carolina is divested of jurisdiction with regard to all matters embraced within or affected by the judgment which is the subject of the appeal. Brooks v.

                        As plaintiffs had filed a notice of appeal, pursuant to G.S. 1-294, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to enter an order under G.S. 6-21.5 awarding defendant the attorneys' fees and expenses it incurred in replying to plaintiffs' motion for relief
                        from judgment. Morgan v. Nash County, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 60, 735 S.E.2d 615 (2012).

                        In a former employee's action, arising from the failure of the employer to pay him benefits under his severance agreement, an award to the employer of attorney's fees was not proper under a statute that limited the fees to those incurred at the trial

                        Fees Not Authorized Where Case Settled by Arbitration. - Where, although building owner filed complaint in civil court, case had already been submitted for arbitration and was settled by the award of the arbitrators, this section did not apply to authorize
                        the trial court to award attorneys' fees incurred in the arbitration hearing; in order for the trial court to make such an award, the "civil action" or "special proceeding" providing the basis for the award must have been held
                        before that tribunal or pursuant to its authority, and no order other than the order which placed the case in inactive status had been entered, nor had any action been taken in the superior court. Thorneburg Hosiery Co. v. G.L.

                        Abuse of Discretion to Reduce Attorneys' Fees Based on Punitive Damages Award. - Trial court abused its discretion to the extent that it reduced the amount of attorneys' fees that it would have otherwise awarded to beneficiaries based solely on the fact
                        that the beneficiaries received a large punitive damages award because the fact that they received a large punitive damages award was not relevant to a proper attorneys' fee calculation. Lacey v. Kirk,

                    <p>
                        As a result of the different purposes sought to be achieved by punitive damages and attorneys' fee awards, a decision to reduce an attorneys' fee award based on the fact that a party received a large punitive damages award would necessarily serve to thwart
                        the purposes sought to be achieved by allowing the recovery of punitive damages without serving any purpose sought to be achieved by an award of attorneys' fees. Lacey v. Kirk, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite>                        376, 767 S.E.2d 632 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Although attorneys' fee jurisprudence gives trial judges substantial discretion in determining what amount of attorneys' fees to award in any particular case, the use of a substantial punitive damages award as the sole reason for reducing an otherwise
                        reasonable attorneys' fee award involves reliance upon a factor that has no reasonable bearing on the making of a proper attorneys' fee award and, for that reason, constitutes an abuse of the trial court's discretion. Lacey v.

                        Collateral Issues. - Attorneys' fee requests under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 11 and G.S. 6-21.5 raise collateral issues which often require consideration

                    On appeal from a magistrate or any court of the General Court of Justice, if the appellant recovers judgment, he shall recover the costs of the appeal and also those costs he ought to have recovered below had the judgment of that court been correct. If
                    in any court of appeal there is judgment for a new trial, or for a new jury, or if the judgment appealed from is not wholly reversed, but partly affirmed and partly disaffirmed, the costs shall be in the discretion of the appellate
                    court.

                    <p>
                        Judgment Prerequisite to Awarding of Costs. - The first part of this section manifestly refers not only to a reversal of the judgment below, but to a judgment in favor of the appellant on the merits and not merely to an order for a new trial. The trial
                        court cannot ordinarily tax the costs of an action in favor of either party unless there is a judgment, costs being an incident of the judgment. Williams v. Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 17</cite>,
                        51 S.E. 790 (1905).

                    <p>
                        Where the subject matter of the action is destroyed before the appeal is heard, the judgment below is presumed to be correct until reversed, and no part of the costs should be adjudged against the appellee. Taylor v. Vann,
                        <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 243</cite>, 37 S.E. 263 (1900).

                    <p>
                        Where Lower Court Judgment Modified. - In McLean v. Breece, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 390</cite>, 18 S.E. 694 (1893), where the judgment was modified in the Supreme Court, the costs were taxed against the appellee. And where
                        the plaintiffs recovered a part judgment on their demand, by establishing a mechanic's lien, they were entitled to costs of appeal. See Hogsed v. Gloucester Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 529</cite>, 87 S.E. 337 (1915).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where the judgment of the court below is modified and affirmed, the appellate division may apportion the costs on appeal between the parties in the exercise of its discretion. Hoskins v. Hoskins, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 704</cite>,
                        131 S.E.2d 326 (1963).

                    <p>
                        The superior court is without power to modify former orders of the appellate court taxing costs on former appeals, as costs thus incurred are no part of superior court costs, but are taxed by, and executions issue out of, the appellate court. Bailey v.
                        Hayman, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 58</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 6 (1942).

                    <p>
                        Partial Affirmance and Partial Reversal. - Where the judgment appealed from is partly affirmed and partly reversed, in the exercise of the discretion permitted by this section, the costs in the appellate court may be divided so that each party pays his
                        own costs. Smith v. Old Dominion Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 249</cite>, 26 S.E. 41 (1896); Hawkins v. Richmond Cedar Works, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 87</cite>, 30 S.E. 13

                    <p>
                        Reversal Necessary to Tax Costs Against Appellee. - Unless the court upon the merits reverses the judgment below, it cannot adjudge any part of the costs against the appellee. Commissioners of Vance County v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 86</cite>,
                        35 S.E. 228 (1900).

                    <p>
                        Case Remanded. - Where an appellant fails to show that he was prejudiced by the order appealed from, he may be taxed with the costs of the appeal, though the case be remanded. Harrington v. Rawls, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 65</cite>,
                        48 S.E. 571 (1904).

                    <p>
                        New Trial. - The taxing of the costs on appeal, by partial new trial being granted, is in the discretion of the court. Satterthwaite v. Goodyear, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 302</cite>, 49 S.E. 205 (1904).

                    <p>
                        Under this section, where the appellant was awarded a partial new trial only, as to one issue only out of several, the costs of the appeal are in the discretion of the court. Rayburn v. Casualty Co., <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 376</cite>,
                        55 S.E. 296 (1906).

                    <p>
                        Where a new trial is granted, the awarding of costs is discretionary. Universal Metal Co. v. Durham &amp; C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 293</cite>, 59 S.E. 50 (1907).

                    <p>
                        Motion in Superior Court to Recover Costs of Appellate Transcript Prohibited. - The cost of preparing the transcription of the record is a part of the costs in the appellate division, and the judge of the superior court upon the subsequent trial is without
                        jurisdiction to entertain a motion for the recovery of such costs. Ward v. Cruse, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 400</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 835 (1952).

                <p>
                    In cases where a court permits a defendant convicted of any criminal offense to give bond or confess judgment, with sureties to secure the fine and costs which may be imposed, the acceptance of such security shall be upon the condition that it shall not
                    operate as a discharge of the original judgment against the defendant nor as a discharge of his person from the custody of the law until the fine and costs are paid.

                        The power of the courts to suspend judgment in criminal cases should only be upheld when sanctioned by usage, and where the consent of the defendant was expressly given or would be implied from the fact that the order was made in the defendant's presence

                    In all criminal actions in any court, if the defendant is acquitted, nolle prosequi entered, or judgment against him is arrested, or if the defendant is discharged from arrest for want of probable cause, the costs, including the fees of all witnesses
                    whom the judge before whom the trial took place shall certify to have been proper for the defense and prosecution, shall be paid by the prosecuting witness, whether marked on the bill or warrant or not, whenever the judge is of the
                    opinion that there was not reasonable ground for the prosecution, or that it was not required by the public interest. If a greater number of witnesses have been summoned than were, in the opinion of the court, necessary to support
                    the charge, the court may, even though it is of the opinion that there was reasonable ground for the prosecution, order the prosecuting witness to pay the attendance fees of such witnesses, if it appear that they were summoned at the
                    prosecuting witness's special request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every judge is authorized to determine who the prosecuting witness is at any stage of a criminal proceeding, whether before or after the bill of indictment has been found, or the defendant acquitted: Provided, that no person shall be made a prosecuting
                    witness after the finding of the bill, unless he shall have been notified to show cause why he should not be made the prosecuting witness of record.

        Standing to Challenge Constitutionality of Section.
       </b> - The plaintiff lacks standing to put in issue the constitutionality of this section where he is under no present threat of prosecution under these statutes, the likelihood that he will run afoul of them in the future
                        is remote and speculative in the extreme, and it can be safely assumed that he does not contemplate either presently or in the future the institution of a prosecution in this State. Fowler v. Alexander, 478 F.2d 694 (4th Cir. 1973).

        Intervention by Federal Court in Operation of Section.
       </b> - The taxing of costs to a prosecuting witness is a constituent part of the criminal procedure of North Carolina. Comity precludes not only the injunction of criminal proceedings in the state courts, but also any disruptive
                        interference thereof. Therefore only when the whole proceeding may be enjoined does the federal district court have jurisdiction to intervene in any way in the operation of this section. Fowler v. Alexander, 340 F. Supp. 168 (M.D.N.C.

                        nor was there shown any impediment to the resolution of the constitutional validity of this section in the general district courts of North Carolina. Fowler v. Alexander, 340 F. Supp. 168 (M.D.N.C. 1972), aff'd, 478 F.2d 694 (4th

                        Certifying Witnesses as Proper for Defense. - Where the court below taxed the costs of an unsuccessful prosecution against the prosecutor without finding that the defendant's witnesses were proper for the defense, as required by this section, judgment
                        would still be allowed to stand if the court below would make and certify the requisite finding that the said witnesses were proper for the defense. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 768</cite>,
                        23 S.E. 247 (1895).

                        In State v. Owens, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 565</cite> (1882), it was stated that this section included such witnesses for the defense as were certified by the counsel to have been proper for the defense, and the Supreme Court
                        approved that judgment. But this was not the point in the appeal, and was only incidentally presented. See State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 877</cite>, 10 S.E. 608 (1889). In State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 662</cite>,
                        10 S.E. 900 (1890), which was a judgment taxing the prosecutor with the costs, the judge did not find and certify that the prosecution was frivolous, malicious or was not for the public good. The Supreme Court held that this judgment
                        was erroneous, and that the statute only allowed a party to be taxed as prosecutor with the costs upon the findings of these facts. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 768</cite>, 23 S.E. 247 (1895).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Notice to Prosecutor Prior to Taxing Costs. - It is necessary for the trial court, in order to adjudge the prosecution of a criminal action to be frivolous and malicious and tax the costs against the prosecutors who have employed attorneys to assist the
                        solicitor, to give the prosecutors notice of such action and hear the matter according to the "law of the land." State v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 323</cite>, 84 S.E. 1049 (1915).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The object of notice is only to give the party a day in court, and it matters not how he gets the notice, if he appears and defends under it. This may be done on motion of the defendant's counsel or by the court of its own motion. State v. Hughes,
                        <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 665</cite> (1880); State v. Hamilton, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 660</cite>, 10 S.E. 854 (1890). The court should find the facts, and when this is done the findings are not reviewable in the appellate
                        court. State v. Owens, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 565</cite> (1882); State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 662</cite>, 10 S.E. 900 (1890); State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 768</cite>, 23 S.E. 247 (1895).

                    <p>
                        A notice to mark one as prosecutor under this section need not be in writing. Where it was announced in open court, upon the calling and continuance of a State case, that a motion would be made at the next term to mark a witness as prosecutor (all the
                        witnesses being present), and on the argument of the motion it was announced that all the parties were present, it was held to be sufficient evidence that such notice was given, and warranted the court in ordering the witness to
                        be marked as prosecutor. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 794</cite> (1881).

                    <p>
                        Not Required by the Public Interest. - A finding by the trial judge that a prosecution of a criminal action "was not for the public interest" is equivalent to a finding that it "was not required by the public interest." State v. Baker,
                        <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 812</cite>, 19 S.E. 145 (1894).

                    <p>
                        Conclusiveness of Court Finding. - A judgment that a prosecution is frivolous and not required by the public interest, and that the prosecutor pay the costs, is conclusive and not appealable. State v. Hamilton, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 660</cite>,
                        10 S.E. 854 (1890).

                    <p>
                        The finding by the judge below that a criminal prosecution was frivolous and malicious is conclusive, and will support a judgment that the prosecutor pay costs, or in default thereof be imprisoned. State v. Lance, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 789</cite>,
                        14 S.E. 110 (1891).

                    <p>
                        Order Set Aside. - Where the trial judge has dismissed a criminal action as being frivolous and malicious, and taxed the prosecutors with costs, and it appears from his findings of record that he has done so without any proper consideration of their affidavits
                        in support of their position and relevant to the issue, so as to deprive them of the benefits of due process of law, his order will be set aside on appeal, leaving the matter open for proper adjudication. State v. Collins,

                    Every such prosecuting witness may be adjudged not only to pay the costs, but he shall also be imprisoned for the willful nonpayment thereof, when the judge before whom the case was tried shall adjudge that the prosecution was frivolous or malicious.

        Standing to Challenge Section.
       </b> - The plaintiff lacked standing to put in issue the constitutionality of this section where he was under no present threat of prosecution under these statutes, the likelihood that he would run afoul of them in the future
                        was remote and speculative in the extreme, and it could be safely assumed that he did not contemplate either presently or in the future the institution of a prosecution in North Carolina. Fowler v. Alexander, 478 F.2d 694 (4th
                        Cir. 1973).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mere fact that earlier the plaintiff was caught in the net of the challenged statutes gave him no standing, where his earlier encounter with the statutes had become moot, the costs assessed were paid, and he was no longer restrained. Fowler v. Alexander,
                        478 F.2d 694 (4th Cir. 1973).

                    <p>
                        The mere fact that the statutes may chill in some indefinable way the urge to prosecute is of no moment in the absence of any real likelihood that plaintiff has or will have reason to prosecute someone in North Carolina. Fowler v. Alexander, 478 F.2d
                        694 (4th Cir. 1973).

        Jurisdiction of Federal Court.
       </b> - A grant of a declaratory judgment that this section was invalid and unconstitutional was held to be outside the equitable jurisdiction of the federal court for the reasons that no bad faith had been alleged, nor any
                        harassment, nor any impediment to the resolution of the constitutional validity in the General Court of Justice of North Carolina. Fowler v. Alexander, 340 F. Supp. 168 (M.D.N.C. 1972), aff'd, 478 F.2d 694 (4th Cir. 1973).

                    <p>
                        The taxing of costs to a prosecuting witness is a constituent part of the criminal procedure of North Carolina. Comity precludes not only the injunction of criminal proceedings in the state courts, but also any disruptive interference thereof. Therefore,
                        only when the whole proceeding may be enjoined does the federal district court have jurisdiction to intervene in any way in the operation of this section. Fowler v. Alexander, 340 F. Supp. 168 (M.D.N.C. 1972), aff'd, 478 F.2d 694
