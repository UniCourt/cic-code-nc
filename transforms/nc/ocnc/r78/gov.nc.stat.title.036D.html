                The General Assembly finds that it is in the public interest to encourage activities by voluntary associations and private citizens that will supplement and augment those services provided by local, State, and federal government agencies in discharge
                of their responsibilities toward individuals with severe chronic disabilities. The General Assembly further finds that, as a result of changing social, economic, and demographic trends, families of persons with severe chronic disabilities
                are increasingly aware of the need for a vehicle by which they can assure ongoing individualized personal concern for a family member with a disability who may survive his or her parents or other family members, and provide for the efficient
                management of trust funds to be used for the benefit of that person with a disability. In a number of other states, voluntary associations have established foundations or trusts intended to be responsive to these concerns. Therefore, the
                General Assembly finds that North Carolina will benefit by the enactment of enabling legislation expressly authorizing the formation of Community Third Party Trusts and Pooled Trusts in accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 1396p(d)(4) and criteria
                set forth by statute and administered by the Secretary of State under Chapter 55A of the General Statutes.

     Effect of Amendments.
    </b> - Session Laws 2010-118, s. 1, effective July 20, 2010, rewrote the section, which formerly read: "The community trust shall settle a community trust by filing a final accounting in the superior court. In addition, at any time before
            the settlement of the final account, the community trust, the Secretary of State, or the Attorney General may bring an action for the dissolution of a nonprofit corporation in the superior court for the purpose of terminating the trust or
            merging it with another charitable trust. No trustee or any private individual is entitled to share in the distribution of any of the trust assets upon dissolution, merger, or settlement of the community trust. Upon dissolution, merger, or
            settlement, the superior court shall distribute all of the remaining net assets of the community trust in a manner that is consistent with the purposes of this Article."

        </h3>
        <p>
            The Department shall adopt rules pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes governing the eligibility of beneficiaries for State medical assistance and
            State-County Special Assistance, and to supplement and expand upon the general requirements set forth in this Chapter, including, but not limited to, rules that may be more restrictive than the general requirements of this Chapter. With respect
            to Medicaid Pooled Trusts, a subaccount is irrevocable. The State shall be paid an amount up to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary by the Department from funds remaining in the individual trust subaccount upon the
            death of the beneficiary or termination of the trust as described in this Chapter. If the pooled trust is to be funded with the proceeds of a settlement of a lawsuit against a third party, the settlement proceeds are subject to the Department's
            subrogated rights of recovery as set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.108A.html#t108Aa02s108A-57" target="_blank">G.S. 108A-57</a></cite>, and all such subrogated rights of recovery shall be satisfied in full prior to
            execution and judicial approval of the trust, or both.
