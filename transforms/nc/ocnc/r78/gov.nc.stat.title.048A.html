                        it has been interpreted, in light of this section, to impose the legal obligation of support only to the child's eighteenth birthday. Harding v. Harding, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 633, 225

                        A consent judgment providing for child support payments until majority or emancipation, entered into when the common-law definition controlled, could not be enforced if the child had reached 18 after the effective date of this Chapter. Gates v. Gates,

                        Where judgment did not specify the duration of time that plaintiff would have to support his children, it would appear that his obligation would continue for the period provided by law.
