      - An amendment to this section in Session Laws 1981, c. 504, s. 9, was made effective upon certification of approval of the constitutional amendments proposed by ss. 1 to 3 of the act. The constitutional amendments were submitted to the people at an election held June 29, 1982, and were defeated. Therefore, the 1981 amendment to this section never went into effect.

       Termination of Assistant Registers of Deeds.
   
   - Assistant registers of deeds implement policies of the elected registers of deeds, exercise discretion, and act as agents for registers of deeds, who are bound by, and may be held civilly liable for, the acts of their assistants, plus assistant registers of deeds serve at the pleasure of their elected superiors, such that, as in this case, a register of deeds may terminate the appointment of an assistant register of deeds for political reasons without violating the federal or state constitution or state public policy.

       After the register of deeds has determined that all statutory and locally adopted prerequisites for recording have been met, the register of deeds shall immediately register all written instruments presented to him for registration. When an instrument is presented for registration, the register of deeds shall endorse upon it the day and hour on which it was presented. This endorsement forms a part of the registration of the instrument. All instruments shall be registered in the precise order in which they were presented for registration. Immediately after endorsing the day and hour of presentation upon an instrument, the register of deeds shall index and cross-index it in its proper sequence.

However, if an instrument fails to meet the requirements because it contains print in a font size smaller than 9 points, the register of deeds may register the instrument without collecting the fee for nonstandard documents if, in the discretion of the register of deeds, the instrument is legible.

        CASE NOTES
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section means a registration which is complete
   
   and perfect, so that it may serve all the purposes of the law in protecting the rights of parties directly interested, and truly give notice to the public. State ex rel. Kivett v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 567</cite>, 10 S.E. 1019 (1890).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Register as Breach of Bond.
   
   - Failure of the register of deeds to register written instruments properly presented is a breach of the bond required by G.S. 161-4. Bank of Spruce Pine v. McKinney, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 668</cite>, 184 S.E. 506 (1935).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Filing Has Effect of Registration.
   
   - The filing for registration is in law registration; all rights and liabilities accrue from the date of filing and do not depend upon the greater or lesser diligence of the register in performing his duty. Glanton v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 427</cite>, 23 S.E. 335 (1895).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Delivery at Proper Office Prerequisite to Valid Filing.
   
   - It is required for a valid filing of a mortgage that it be delivered at the official office of the register of deeds, and where such a paper is delivered to the register outside of his office it is ineffectual until he returns and makes the proper entry. McHan v. Dorsey, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 694</cite>, 92 S.E. 598 (1917).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Time of Delivery to Proper Officer Determinative.
   
   - Where the filing of a paper in the office of the register of deeds is necessary to the title to lands, the time thereof will be considered as that at which the paper was delivered to and received by the proper officers; and while the file mark of the officer is evidence as to the time, it is not essential under the North Carolina statutes. Carolina-Tennessee Power Co. v. Hiawassee River Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 668</cite>, 96 S.E. 99 (1918), appeal dismissed, 252 U.S. 341, 40 S. Ct. 330, 64 L. Ed. 601 (1920).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Register's Endorsement Is Not Essential.
   
   - The endorsement required to be made by register of deeds on mortgages and deeds in trust on the day on which such deeds are presented to him for registration, is not essential to registration; and when made is not conclusive evidence, but only prima facie evidence, of the facts therein recited. Cunninggim v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 33</cite>, 13 S.E. 714 (1891).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Fees Must Be Timely Paid.
   
   - Where a deed was handed to the register for registration, but he refused to register it until his fees were paid several months later, at which time he made an endorsement that it was filed on the day first presented, followed by an explanatory endorsement reciting the facts, it was held that the register was not compelled to register the deed before his fees were paid, and that the facts did not constitute a filing for registration on the day when the deed was first presented to the register. Cunninggim v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 33</cite>, 13 S.E. 714 (1891).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indexing and Cross-Indexing Essential.
   
   - The indexing and cross-indexing of deeds or other instruments in writing filed with a register of deeds for registration, as required by this section, is essential to their proper registration. Bank of Spruce Pine v. McKinney, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 668</cite>, 184 S.E. 506 (1935); Johnson Cotton Co. v. Hobgood, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 227</cite>, 90 S.E.2d 541 (1955).

       The indexing of the deeds in the office of the register thereof is an essential part of the registration; and where the grantor's name has been omitted from the book, a subsequent grantee of the same lands from the same grantor acquires the title from him. Fowle &amp; Son v. O'Ham, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 12</cite>, 96 S.E. 639 (1918). See also, Dorman v. Goodman, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 406</cite>, 196 S.E. 352 (1938), commented on in 19 N.C.L. Rev. 77 (1941).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Certificates of Registration as Prima Facie Evidence.
   
   - The certificates of registration made by registers of deeds are prima facie evidence of the facts therein recited. Sellers v. Sellers, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 13</cite>, 3 S.E. 917 (1887).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficiency of Acknowledgment.
   
   - A certificate by the clerk of the superior court that the officers of the corporation who signed the deed "acknowledged the due execution of the annexed instrument for the purpose therein set forth" was sufficient to warrant the registration of the deed. Heath, Springs &amp; Co. v. Big Falls Cotton Mills, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 202</cite>, 20 S.E. 369 (1894).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Clerical Mistake.
   
   - A registry of a mortgage is not void because of a clerical mistake made by the register in transcribing, which does not affect the sense and provision as to the amount secured, description of property, etc., or obscure the meaning of the instrument. Royster v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 156</cite>, 24 S.E. 796 (1896).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Omission of Signatures.
   
   - The registration of a deed showing the probate, including the separate examination of the wife, and the order of registration, and the names of the grantors, but omitting a copy of their signatures at the end of the instrument is sufficient notice under this section. Smith v. Ayden Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 47</cite>, 56 S.E. 555 (1907).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Omission of Corporate Seal.
   
   - The failure of the register of deeds to copy the seal of the corporation on his books, or make an imitation copy thereon, does not render the conveyance of the lands invalid where the recitals in the deed signify that the seal was in fact attached, it appears upon the original, and the books show the name of the corporation appearing in brackets therein at its proper location. Heath, Springs &amp; Co. v. Big Falls Cotton Mills, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 202</cite>, 20 S.E. 369 (1894); Lockville Power Corp. v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 219</cite>, 84 S.E. 398 (1915).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Omission of Great Seal of State.
   
   - The fact that it does not appear of record that a scroll or imitation of the great seal of the State was copied thereon does not invalidate the registry of a grant. The recital in the body of the grant, as recorded, of the affixing of the seal is sufficient evidence of its regularity. Broadwell v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 475</cite>, 55 S.E. 340 (1906).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Correction of Omission or Error.
   
   - Where the register has committed an error or omission in the recordation of an instrument he has the power to correct such error. Brown v. Hutchinson, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. 205</cite>, 71 S.E. 302 (1911).

       Failure to Register or Index as Breach of Bond.
   
   - The failure of the register of deeds to register instruments properly presented or his failure to properly index and cross-index them is a breach of his statutory bond, for which, under this section, he and the surety on his bond are liable to the person injured.

       Indexing and Cross-Indexing Essential to Proper Registration.
   
   - The indexing of the deeds in the office of the register thereof is an essential part of the registration; and where the grantor's name has been omitted from the book, a subsequent grantee of the same lands from the same grantor acquires the title from him. Fowle &amp; Son v. O'Ham, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 12</cite>, 96 S.E. 639 (1918). See also, Dorman v.

      <p>
       Priority of Second Mortgage Where First Mortgage Not Indexed.
   
   - A mortgage duly filed for registration and spread upon the registry, but not indexed or cross-indexed as required by this section, is not superior to the lien of a duly registered "second mortgage" on the same property. Story v. Slade, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 596</cite>, 155 S.E. 256 (1930).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Priority of Properly Indexed Chattel Mortgage Over General Mortgage.
   
   - Under this section and G.S. 161-21, a duly recorded chattel mortgage which was indexed and cross-indexed in the general chattel mortgage index had priority over a mortgage covering the same personal property and also certain real estate which was previously executed and recorded and indexed in the general real estate mortgage index, but subsequently indexed and cross-indexed in the general chattel mortgage index. Pruitt v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 696</cite>, 161 S.E. 212 (1931).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Recorded deed of trust dated August 5, 1982, did not have priority over warranty deed recorded on May 5, 1983,
   
   where it was not indexed until after plaintiff's deed was duly registered. The priority of instruments affecting an interest in real property which are required to be recorded is established by the priority of their registration, and an instrument is not deemed registered until it has been properly indexed. Badger v. Benfield, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 337 S.E.2d 596 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 374</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 890 (1986).

      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Filing at Same Instant of Time.
   
   - Where a purchase-money mortgage and another mortgage given to secure cash payment for land were filed for registration at the same instant of time, neither mortgage had priority over the other, but both constituted a first lien on the land; the fact that one necessarily appeared before the other on the index of the day's transactions did not alter this result, since the record failed to show that the mortgages were not indexed at the same time. Hood v. Landreth, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 621</cite>, 178 S.E. 222 (1935).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no law requiring that cross-index show capacity in which the grantor acted
   
   in the making or execution of a deed. Tocci v. Nowfall, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 550</cite>, 18 S.E.2d 225 (1942).

        Recording and indexing a mortgage executed by one not the owner of the property

       mentioned therein will not give constructive notice binding upon third parties dealing with the true owner. It is, at least as to third parties, as though no mortgage had been made. McKnight v. M. & J. Fin. Corp., 247 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Failure to Index Mortgage in Name of Wife.
   
   - The proper indexing of a mortgage upon lands is an essential part of its registration, and where the husband and wife make a mortgage on her lands which is only indexed by the register of deeds in the name of the husband, it is not good as against a subsequent purchaser for value by deed from the husband and wife that had been properly indexed and registered. Heaton v. Heaton, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 475</cite>, 146 S.E. 146 (1929).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Index of Mortgage on Land Held by Entireties under "J.H. and Wife".
   
   - Where the husband and wife mortgage their lands held by the entireties and the mortgage was indexed and cross-indexed under "J.H. and wife," the name of the wife not appearing on the index although it appeared on the mortgage deed, the index was sufficient to put a reasonable man upon inquiry which would have disclosed the facts, and upon the husband's death and the wife's remarriage, a mortgage given by the wife and her second husband was subject to the first mortgage; the subsequent mortgagee was charged with notice thereof, and could not restrain the first mortgagee from foreclosing his mortgage on the ground of insufficient indexing, although the name of the wife should have appeared on the index. West v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. 693</cite>, 153 S.E. 257 (1930).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indexing and cross-indexing deed of trust given by tenant and remainderman in name of life tenant only
   
   followed by the words "et al.," was not a sufficient compliance with this section, and where another deed of trust was subsequently executed on the same lands which was registered, indexed and cross-indexed in compliance with this section, the purchaser under foreclosure of the second deed of trust acquired title free from the lien of the improperly indexed prior deed of trust. Woodley v. Gregory, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 280</cite>, 171 S.E. 65 (1933), distinguishing. Prudential Ins. Co. v. Forbes, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 252</cite>, 165 S.E. 699 (1932), in which the lien was indexed under "S.T. et ux."

       </b>
       - Where the erstwhile holder of a first deed of trust failed to have its recording properly indexed in the official real property PIN index, the recorded deed of trust was not compliant with former G.S. 161-22, and was avoidable under G.S. 47-20 and 11 U.S.C.S.

       Indexing of Chattel Mortgage Held Sufficient.
   
   - A proper index of chattel mortgages kept for years in the books wherein the instruments were registered was a substantial compliance with this section and G.S. 161-21, where the record of the instrument could have been found with an ordinary search such as a man of ordinary prudence would have made.

       Where a chattel mortgage was duly transcribed upon the records in the office of the register of deeds in the chattel mortgage book and an erroneous book and page were given opposite the name of the grantor in the direct index and opposite the name of the grantee in the cross-index, but within two days of the time the chattel mortgage was transcribed on the records the cross-index was corrected, such indexing constituted a sufficient compliance with this section.

       Liability on Bond for Failure to Index.
   
   - The failure of a register of deeds to properly index the registry of a mortgage renders him liable on his official bond to one injured by such neglect. State ex rel. Daniel v.

      <p>
       Where Failure Is Proximate Cause of Injury.
   
   - While the register of deeds and the surety on his official bond are liable for his failure to index and cross-index instruments, such liability does not arise to the individual claiming damages therefor unless the default of the register in these particulars has been the proximate cause of injury to the claimant, and liability will not be imputed to the register of deeds when the negligence of the claimant or his agent has caused or concurred in causing the injury.

   - Evidence that one letter of a <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> debtor's first name was omitted when a deed of trust the debtor gave a creditor was recorded pursuant to G.S. 47-20 did not show that the deed of trust was invalid, such that the debtor could treat the creditor's claim as wholly unsecured; the creditor substantially complied with the notice requirement of G.S. 161-22 when it recorded the deed of trust, even though it misspelled the debtor's name.

        Deed of Trust Avoidable Where Not Properly Indexed.
       </b>
       - Where the erstwhile holder of a first deed of trust failed to have its recording properly indexed in the official real property PIN index, the recorded deed of trust was not compliant with former G.S. 161-22, and was avoidable under G.S. 47-20 and 11 U.S.C.S.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because defendant bank's deed of trust on a debtor's property contained Tract II's parcel identifier number (PIN) but not the PIN assigned to Tract I, plaintiff <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a></cite> trustee could avoid the lien as to Tract I under 11 U.S.C.S.
   <span class="s2">
    §
   </span>
   544(a)(3), since requiring a search of the grantor/grantee index in addition to the PIN index would render G.S. 161-22.2, allowing a PIN index, meaningless, and the trustee's actual or constructive knowledge of the bank's deed of trust was irrelevant since 11 U.S.C.S.
   <span class="s2">
    §

   544(a)(3) expressly stated that a trustee took a debtor's property without regard to any knowledge of the trustee or of any creditor. SunTrust Bank, N.A. v. Northen, 433 B.R. 532 (M.D.N.C. 2010), aff'd, 669 F.3d 177, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 2658 (4th Cir. N.C. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court would have been effectively laying waste to North Carolina's recordation system if it had concluded that recording a deed of trust on some unofficial index, not the official index, amounted to substantial compliance or that recording a deed of trust with respect to the wrong parcel substantially complied with the recordation requirements. SunTrust Bank, N.A. v. Macky (In re McCormick), 669 F.3d 177 (4th Cir. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a bona fide purchaser of the parcel would not have been charged with notice of the bank's lien based on an examination of the parcel identifier number index when the bankruptcy petition was filed (the deed of trust, while recorded as to a different contiguous parcel, was not so recorded as to the parcel at issue), even if the purchaser had knowledge of the lien, the trustee likewise was not imputed with such knowledge; therefore, the trustee was properly allowed to avoid the lien under 11 U.S.C.S.
