       Legislative Intent.
   
   - The constitutional independence of the executive offices, and their differing functions and duties, create clear potential for conflict between their respective holders. In the event of such conflict, power in the Attorney General to resolve, without their consent, controversies involving agencies or departments under the supervision of the Governor could be abused by exercise in a manner effectively derogative of the Governor's constitutional duties to exercise executive power and to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers. The General Assembly, in the enactment of G.S. 114-2(2), did not intend to create such potential. Tice v. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 48, 312 S.E.2d 241 (1984).

        CASE NOTES
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Constitutionality.
   
   - The duty of the Attorney General to appear for the State in any court proceeding in which the State may be a party as provided in subdivision (1) of this section does not violate N.C. Const., Art. III,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1. Martin v. Thornburg, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 533</cite>, 359 S.E.2d 472 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Derivation.
   
   - Pursuant to the authority under Article III,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   18 of the North Carolina Constitution, the General Assembly enacted this section, which prescribes the duties of the Attorney General. Sotelo v. Drew, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 473 S.E.2d 379 (1996), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 750</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 439 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory and Common-law Duties.
   
   - The duties of the Attorney General in this State as prescribed by statutory and common law include the duty to appear for and to defend the State or its agencies in all actions in which the State may be a party or interested. Martin v. Thornburg, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 533</cite>, 359 S.E.2d 472 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative Intent.
   
   - The constitutional independence of the executive offices, and their differing functions and duties, create clear potential for conflict between their respective holders. In the event of such conflict, power in the Attorney General to resolve, without their consent, controversies involving agencies or departments under the supervision of the Governor could be abused by exercise in a manner effectively derogative of the Governor's constitutional duties to exercise executive power and to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers. The General Assembly, in the enactment of subdivision (2) of this section, did not intend to create such potential. Tice v. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 48, 312 S.E.2d 241 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Opinions Advisory Only.
   
   - An opinion of the Attorney General, given in the performance of his statutory duty under subdivision (5) of this section, is advisory only. Lawrence v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 352</cite>, 186 S.E. 504 (1936), rev'd on other grounds, 300 U.S. 245, 57 S. Ct. 443, 81 L. Ed. 623 (1937).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Directives as to Legal Duties of Constitutional Officers.
   
   - The Attorney General has no constitutional authority to issue a directive to any other constitutional officer concerning his legal duties. State v. Loesch, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 611</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 654 (1953).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The responsibility for interpreting a tax statute is placed on the Commissioner of Revenue (now Secretary)
   
   by G.S. 105-264, and the Attorney General's opinion in regard thereto is advisory only. In re Virginia-Carolina Chem. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 531</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 823 (1958).

   - The duty of the Attorney General as to the solicitors (now district attorneys) of the State is purely advisory. State v. Loesch, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 611</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 654 (1953).
   <br />

       As to duties of Attorney General and district attorney in case on appeal,
   
   see State v. Hickman, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 163 S.E.2d 632 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       In passing G.S. 114-11.6, the General Assembly made it clear
   
   that even upon a proper request and authorization by a district attorney, the Special Prosecution Division is to participate in criminal prosecutions only if the Attorney General, in his sole discretion as an independent constitutional officer, approves. Thus trial court exceeded its authority when it ordered that "the Attorney General's Office shall immediately assume the prosecution of" a capital case. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (1) of this section does not contemplate the Attorney General's initiating an action under Article 2 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.128.html" target="_blank">Chapter 128</a></cite>,
   
   where language therein has specifically set out who may file a petition for removal of a sheriff or police officer from office. State v. Felts, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 205, 339 S.E.2d 99, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 555</cite>, 344 S.E.2d 11 (1986).

      <p>
       The Attorney General of North Carolina had standing
   
   to file a brief on behalf of appellant-mother, a New York resident, in a case involving the enforcement of orders rendered in an action to register a foreign child support order. New York v. Paugh, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 521 S.E.2d 475 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The duty to "consult with and advise the prosecutors,
   
   when requested by them, in all matters pertaining to the duties of their office" gives the Attorney General the authority to advise the prosecutors, not to completely replace them or act instead of them, unless there is an express statutory provision authorizing the Attorney General to initiate a particular action. State v. Felts, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 205, 339 S.E.2d 99, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 555</cite>, 344 S.E.2d 11 (1986).

       The Attorney General is bound by the traditional rule governing the attorney-client relationship
   
   when representing the departments, agencies, institutions, commissions, bureaus or other organized activities of the State. Tice v. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 48, 312 S.E.2d 241 (1984).

       Attorney General cannot enter a consent judgment without the consent of a duly authorized department official.

      </p>
      <p>
       An agency or department of the State should have the right possessed by other litigants to determine whether its counsel, whether the Attorney General or otherwise, can enter a consent judgment on its behalf. Such a right is also consonant with fulfillment by the respective agencies and departments of the State of their statutorily assigned duties. Tice v. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 48, 312 S.E.2d 241 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing in the common-law powers of the Attorney General which grants him authority to enter consent judgments binding the agencies and departments of the State without their consent. North Carolina statutes do not expressly grant such power. The assignment of specific responsibilities and duties to the various agencies and departments would appear to indicate legislative intent to the contrary. Given the constitutional and statutory structure of State government, and the assignment of duties and responsibilities between and among its officers, agencies, and departments, considerations of sound public policy also suggest the contrary rule. Tice v. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 48, 312 S.E.2d 241 (1984).

       Dual Role of Attorney General's Office.

       Public Trust Doctrine.
   
   - Only the State, through the attorney general, was authorized to bring in a representative capacity for and on behalf of the using and consuming public of North Carolina actions deemed to be advisable in the public interest; where environmental plaintiffs did not seek individual recovery, but merely sought injunctive and monetary relief for the restoration and remediation of public waterways allegedly damaged by hog farming companies, the trial court properly dismissed the suit due to a lack of standing.

     <p>
      There is hereby established in the office of the Attorney General of North Carolina, a Special Prosecution Division. The attorneys assigned to this Division shall be available to prosecute or assist in the prosecution of criminal cases when requested to do so by a district attorney and the Attorney General approves. In addition, these attorneys assigned to this Division shall serve as legal advisers to the State Bureau of Investigation and the Police Information Network and perform any other duties assigned to them by the Attorney General.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Provision authorizing attorneys in the Special Prosecution Division to "perform any other duties
   
   assigned to them by the Attorney General" merely authorizes the Attorney General to delegate those duties which he is elsewhere authorized to perform. It creates no independent authority in its own right. State v. Felts, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 205, 339 S.E.2d 99, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 555</cite>, 344 S.E.2d 11 (1986).

       When this section is read in pari materia with N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   
<span class="s1">

     §
    
</span>

    18,
   
   it is apparent that our Constitution and statutes give the district attorneys of the State the exclusive discretion and authority to determine whether to request, and thus permit, the prosecution of any individual case by the Special Prosecution Division. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section authorizes the several elected district attorneys of the State to permit
   
   the Special Prosecution Division of the Office of the Attorney General to prosecute individual criminal cases in their prosecutorial districts. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section allows special prosecutors to prosecute or assist district attorneys in the prosecution of criminal cases only.
   
   It does not authorize the Attorney General or his designate to bring a proceeding, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.128.html#t128a02s128-16" target="_blank">G.S. 128-16</a></cite> et seq., for removal of a sheriff or police officer. State v. Felts, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 205, 339 S.E.2d 99, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 555</cite>, 344 S.E.2d 11 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court exceeded its authority and invaded the province of an independent constitutional officer
   
   when it ordered the district attorney to request that the Attorney General prosecute defendant in a capital case. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority of Trial Court Exceeded.
   
   - In passing this section, the General Assembly made it clear that even upon a proper request and authorization by a district attorney, the Special Prosecution Division is to participate in criminal prosecutions only if the Attorney General, in his sole discretion as an independent constitutional officer, approves. Thus trial court exceeded its authority when it ordered that "the Attorney General's Office shall immediately assume the prosecution of" a capital case. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court exceeded its authority by ordering that in order to avoid the possibility or impression of any conflict of interest, the district attorney and his entire staff must withdraw from a capital case and have no further participation either directly or indirectly with regard to the case. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applied
   
   in State v. Sexton, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 336</cite>, 532 S.E.2d 179 (2000).

Such programs might include studies to determine the effects of contextual bias in forensic practice (e.g., studies to determine whether and to what extent the results of forensic analysis are influenced by knowledge regarding the background of the suspect and the investigator's theory of the case). In addition, research on sources of human error should be closely linked with research conducted to quantify and characterize the amount of error. Based on the results of these studies, and in consultation with the North Carolina Forensic Sciences Advisory Board, the North Carolina State Crime Laboratory should develop standard operating procedures (that will lay the foundation for model protocols) to minimize, to the extent possible, potential bias and sources of human error in forensic science. These standard operating procedures should apply to all forensic analyses that may be used in litigation."
