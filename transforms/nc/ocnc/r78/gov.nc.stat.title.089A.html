    </b>
    - Session Laws 2001-496, s. 12.1(b), provides: "The State Board of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors and the Board of Landscape Architects shall agree to a Memorandum of Understanding that identifies areas of overlap or common practice regarding the scope of their respective professions and means for resolving disputes concerning standards of practice, qualifications, and jurisdiction regarding the identified areas of overlap. The parties shall send a joint written report to the General Assembly no later than April 30, 2002, concerning the Memorandum of Understanding and whether the changes in Section 13.1(a) of this act [s. 12.1(a) of Session Laws 2001-496] should be repealed or modified, and the General Assembly may consider and take action on the report during its session in 2002 or at any other time as it may consider appropriate."

     Preparation of Construction Drawings.
    </b>
    - A town may not, under its land use ordinance, require that all construction drawings submitted for approval be prepared and sealed by a licensed professional engineer, to the exclusion of licensed professional architects. Such a restriction would be in excess of the powers granted the town. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Michael B. Brough, Carrboro Town Attorney, 59 N.C.A.G. 58 (1989).

     Street Design and Storm Drainage Systems.
    </b>
    - The detailed drawings and accompanying calculations of street design and storm drainage systems, including subsurface systems and component structures, fall within the definition of the practice of engineering and not within the definition of landscape architecture. See opinion of Attorney General to Jerry T. Carter, Executive Director, N.C. Board of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors, 2001 N.C. AG LEXIS 8 (3/22/2001).
