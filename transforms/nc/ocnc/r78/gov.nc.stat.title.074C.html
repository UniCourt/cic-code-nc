                        repossession of that property, is reasonably related to the purposes of the Act, in that it requires the Private Protective Services Board to license only those individuals engaged in a covered occupation not regulated elsewhere.

                        Constitutionality. - The classification in subsection (b) of this section, which exempts from regulation under the Private Protective Services Act insurance adjusters, credit rating services, attorneys, company or railroad police, and holders of liens
                        on personal property when engaging in repossession of that property, is reasonably related to the purposes of the Act, in that it requires the Private Protective Services Board to license only those individuals engaged in a covered

                        Purpose of Exceptions in Subsection (b). - The exceptions in subsection (b) of this section are a recognition by the General Assembly that all those who could conceivably fit within the definitions of those occupations covered by the Act are not similarly
                        situated. Those exceptions serve merely to exempt those occupations regulated elsewhere in state or federal law, often more extensively than the regulation of private investigators. Shipman v. North Carolina Private Protective

                        Nothing in the statute authorizes a security guard to arrest and search private citizens; in this case, one finding purported to find that private security guards were licensed and authorized by the State to arrest and search private citizens, but this
                        finding and others were not binding on the court because they were not supported by competent evidence, and the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to suppress because the security officer was not a State actor. State

                        Security Guard Not State Employee. - Despite a security officer being licensed as a security guard by the State and subject to training and certification requirements, he was not considered an officer or employee of the State. State v. Weaver,
                        <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 752 S.E.2d 240 (2013).

                        Consideration of Private Investigative Work. - While the Private Protective Services Board has the statutory power to grant or deny licenses, it must still act within the scope of its statutory powers. The statutes direct the Board to consider all evidence
                        of experience that is investigative in nature to determine if the applicant had the necessary experience. Therefore, where the Board recognized that petitioner had worked as a runner for a bail bondsman, but refused to consider
                        that work in satisfaction of the investigative experience requirement, the Board erroneously disregarded the mandate of subdivision (a)(8) to consider all private investigative work. Boston v. North Carolina Private Protective

                            In lieu of revocation or suspension of a license or permit under G.S. 74C-12, a civil penalty of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000) may be assessed by the Board against any person or business that violates any provision of this Chapter or any
                            rule of the Board adopted pursuant to this Chapter. In determining the amount of any penalty, the Board shall consider the degree and extent of harm caused by the violation. The clear proceeds of civil penalties provided for

                            Proceedings for the assessment of civil penalties under this section are governed by Chapter 150B of the General Statutes. If the person assessed a civil penalty fails to pay the penalty to the Board, the Board may institute an action in the superior
                            court of the county in which the person resides or has a principal place of business to recover the unpaid amount of the penalty. An action to recover a civil penalty under this section does not relieve any party from any other

                        Board's Authority to Assess Civil Penalty Not Unconstitutional. - The authority of the Board under subsection (c) of this section to assess a civil penalty of up to $2,000 in lieu of revocation or suspension of a license is not an unconstitutional attempt
                        to confer a judicial power on a state agency. The provision authorizing civil penalties is reasonably necessary to the Board in fulfilling its duties to require that those who hold themselves out as providing private protective
                        services to citizens must meet high standards of training and professionalism. North Carolina Private Protective Servs. Bd. v. Gray, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 143, 360 S.E.2d 135 (1987).
