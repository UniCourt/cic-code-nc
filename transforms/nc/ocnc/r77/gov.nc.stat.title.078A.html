                        Constitutionality. - It is within the police power of the State to pass a statute for the protection of its citizens against the sale to them of worthless shares of stock in speculative companies in the exercise of a power in the State reserved from that
                        grant to the federal government, and such a statute does not contravene either the State or federal Constitution. State ex rel. Smith v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 643</cite>,
                        132 S.E. 792 (1926), error dismissed, 275 U.S. 505, 48 S. Ct. 156, 72 L. Ed. 396 (1927).

                        Chapter Is Within Police Power. - The regulation of the sale of securities for the protection of the public is within the police power of the State. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 621</cite>, 5 S.E.2d 844 (1939).

                        Application of Chapter. - This Chapter applies where money is invested in stock, securities, profit-sharing agreements, etc., with the purpose of securing an income from the employment of the money, and a contract whereby the owner of a copyright system
                        gives the exclusive right to another to operate the system in certain counties, and in return is to receive a percentage of the gross receipts from the operation of the system, with further provision for a division of net profit
                        from sales or contracts written by either party, does not contemplate the placing of money in a way to secure an income from its employment, but the earning of a portion of the gross receipts in return for individual services,
                        and the agreement is not a profit-sharing scheme or investment contract within the intent and meaning of the statute. State v. Heath, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 135</cite>, 153 S.E. 855 (1930).

                        The purpose of "Blue Sky Laws" is to protect the general public from "wildcat" organizers, promoters and their agents, whether foreign or domestic, preying upon an unsuspecting and confiding public by selling "blue sky stock," without obtaining license
                        and giving bond. State ex rel. Smith v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 643</cite>, 132 S.E. 792 (1926), error dismissed, 275 U.S. 505, 48 S. Ct. 156, 72 L. Ed. 396 (1927).

                        No Precedence over Administrative Procedure Act. - The provisions of this Chapter are not stated with the specificity and particularity sufficient to take precedence over any similar provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba01s150B-1" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-1</a></cite> et seq., which might conceivably apply to the actions and proceedings addressed by the Securities Act. See opinion
                        of the Attorney General to Mr. Stephen M. Wallis, Deputy Securities Administrator (acting), 58 N.C.A.G. 76 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contested Cases. - Determinations made by the securities administrator pursuant to his statutory authority are considered "contested cases" within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba01s150B-2" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-2(2)</a></cite>.
                        Such determinations control or restrict the activities of dealers, salesmen, or issuers of securities, but these determinations only become "contested cases" if the administrator's action is "disputed" by the subject of such determination.
                        See opinion of the Attorney General to Mr. Stephen M. Wallis, Deputy Securities Administrator (acting), 58 N.C.A.G. 76 (1988).

                        "Tipper" and "Tippee" Defined. - Federal law has defined a "tipper" as a person who has possession of material inside information and who makes selective disclosure of such information for trading or other personal purposes. A "tippee" is one who receives
                        such information from a "tipper." Skinner v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 320 S.E.2d 424, modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 267</cite>, 333

                    <p>
                        Use of Securities Laws to Stop Both Tippers and Tippees. - Although heretofore securities laws promulgated to protect against the disclosure of "inside information" have primarily been used to stop tippers, so as to most effectively insure that the innocent
                        investing public is protected, the unscrupulous tippee as well as the tipper must be deterred. Skinner v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 320 S.E.2d 424, modified on
                        other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 267</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 236 (1985).

                    <p>
                        The concept of selective disclosure of inside information assumes the fact that the tipper will tell a tippee who will act on the information and unfairly profit by it at the public's expense. The investing public will more readily be protected if those
                        tippees are discouraged from acting on any inside information illegally disclosed. It is also more probable that inside trading will stop if tippers realize the senselessness of risking criminal prosecution for disclosing inside
                        information to a tippee who will not use the information. Moreover, there should be no opportunity in the scheme of securities laws' enforcement for the tippee to weigh the reliability and the value of the tip against the amount
                        he may be able to recover in a lawsuit against the tipper for his disclosure of false inside information, especially when that tippee could conceivably recover treble damages under the Unfair Trade Practice Act. Skinner v. E.F.

                                                The purchaser will receive no returns (i.e., dividends and interest) until the insured dies.

                                                The actual annual rate of return on a viatical settlement contract is dependent upon an accurate projection of the insured's life expectancy, and the actual date of the insured's death. An annual "guaranteed" rate of return is not determinable.

                                                The viaticated life insurance contract should not be considered a liquid purchase since it is impossible to predict the exact timing of its maturity and the funds probably are not available until the death of the insured. There is no established secondary
                                                market for resale of these products by the purchaser.

                                                The purchaser is responsible for payment of the insurance premium or other costs related to the policy, if required by the terms of the viatical purchase agreement. These payments may reduce the purchaser's return. If a party other than the purchaser

                        to one purchaser and to five other purchasers a month later was part of a single financing plan since the second offering was contemplated at the time of the initial offering and it was apparent that the offering memorandum would

                        the proceeds of the initial offering were for use as seed money while the proceeds of the second offering were for use as general operating expenses, and the profit and losses between the two types of offerings were allocated differently

                        Initial Securities Offering Violated This Section. - Where it was clear that offering of securities initially to one purchaser and to five other purchasers a month later were part of a single financing plan since the second offering was contemplated at
                        the time of the initial offering and it was apparent that the offering memorandum would not be published until sellers were sure initial offering was purchased and the consideration for all the offerings was the same, the initial
                        offering violated the registration requirements of this section and such violation precluded protection under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t78Aa03s78A-17" target="_self">G.S. 78A-17(9)</a></cite> and subjected
                        the sellers to the civil liabilities provision of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t78Aa07s78A-56ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 78A-56(a)(1)</a></cite>, even though the proceeds of the initial offering were for use as seed money while
                        the proceeds of the second offering were for use as general operating expenses, and the profit and losses between the two types of offerings were allocated differently and each had different tax deduction consequences. Walker v.

                        Administrator of the date when the federal registration statement is expected to become effective, the Administrator shall promptly advise the registrant by telephone or telegraph, at the registrant's expense, whether all the conditions
                        are satisfied and whether he then contemplates the institution of a proceeding under G.S. 78A-29; but this advice by the Administrator does not preclude the institution of such a proceeding at any time.

                        Any person aggrieved by a final order of the Administrator may obtain a review of the order in the Superior Court of Wake County by filing in court, within 30 days after a written copy of the decision is served upon the person by personal service or by
                        registered or certified mail, a written petition praying that the order be modified or set aside in whole or in part. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith served upon the Administrator, and thereupon the Administrator shall
                        certify and file in court a copy of the filing and evidence upon which the order was entered. When these have been filed, the court has exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, enforce, or set aside the order, in whole or in part.
                        The findings of the Administrator as to the facts, if supported by competent, material and substantial evidence, are conclusive. If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional material evidence, and shows to
                        the satisfaction of the court that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce the evidence in the hearings before the Administrator, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the Administrator and

                        evidence together with any modified or new findings or order. The judgment of the court is final, subject to review by the Court of Appeals.

                        Business court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of sellers and a real estate company on purchasers' secondary liability claims because the purchasers failed to offer proof that either the sellers or the company provided material aid with
                        the requisite actual knowledge under the North Carolina Securities Act; the sellers and company had no duty to disclose anything directly to the purchasers, and there was no proof they knew of the alleged misrepresentations a bidder

                        Deceptive Practices Claim Dismissed. - Investor's deceptive practices claims, alleging limited liability company managers committed constructive fraud when persuading the investors to invest in and become members of a limited liability company, failed
                        because (1) <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.075.html#t75a08s75-141" target="_blank">G.S. 75-1.1</a></cite> did not apply to securities fraud claims, (2) the constructive fraud claim failed
                        as a matter of law, and (3) the gravamen of the constructive fraud claim was securities fraud. Atkinson v. Lackey, - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Feb. 27, 2015).

                        Motion for New Trial Based on Inconsistent Verdict Denied. - Director of a corporation who was held liable to investors in the corporation, for selling securities by means of false and misleading statements of material fact, was not entitled to a new
                        trial because the verdict was not inconsistent as the evidence justified a finding that the statements of the corporation's chief executive officer, taken in context and as a whole, were not materially false and misleading, while

                        administrator which arises under this Chapter or any rule or order hereunder after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the person filing the consent. A person who has filed such
                        a consent in connection with a previous registration or notice filing need not file another. Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the Administrator, but it is not effective unless (i) the plaintiff,
                        who may be the Administrator in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by him, forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail to the defendant or respondent at his address on file with the
                        Administrator, and (ii) the plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with the subsection is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.

                        over him cannot otherwise be obtained in this State, that conduct shall be considered equivalent to his appointment of the Administrator or his successor in office to be his attorney to receive service of any lawful process in
                        any noncriminal suit, action, or proceeding against him or his successor executor or administrator which grows out of that conduct and which is brought under this Chapter or any rule or order hereunder with the same force and validity
