                            Form of Acquisition Not Changed. - The act of 1784, which subsequently converted the estate tail into a fee simple, did not change the original form of the acquisition, which still continued to be by purchase. Ballard v. Griffin,

                        <p>
                            The word "children" is ordinarily a word of purchase. Wright v. Vaden, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 299</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 31 (1966).

                            "Heirs of their bodies" is equivalent to the words "heirs general." Revis v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 579</cite>, 90 S.E. 573 (1916); Cohoon v. Upton, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 88</cite>, 93 S.E. 446 (1917).

                            When the term "heirs of the body" is used in its technical sense, it imports a class of persons to take indefinitely in succession, from generation to generation. Ray v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 715</cite>, 155 S.E.2d

         II. RULE IN SHELLEY'S CASE.
        </b>
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Statement of Rule. - A good definition of the rule in Shelley's case, and the most general, is as follows: "That when the ancestor by any gift or conveyance taketh an estate of freehold, and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited either mediately
                            or immediately to his heirs, in fee or in tail, the word 'heirs' is a word of limitation of the estate and not a word of purchase." Nichols v. Gladden, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 497</cite>,
                            23 S.E. 459 (1895). See also the statement of the rule in Smith v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 314</cite>, 51 S.E. 889, 2 L.R.A. (n.s.) 172 (1905); Wright v. Vaden, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 299</cite>, 146
                            S.E.2d 31 (1966).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rule in Shelley's case says, in substance, that if an estate of freehold be limited to A, with remainder to his heirs, general or special, the remainder, although importing an independent gift to the heirs, as original takers, shall confer the inheritance
                            on A, the ancestor. Ray v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 715</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 185 (1967).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Force of Rule in North Carolina. - The common-law doctrine known as the rule in Shelley's case is in force in this State. Nichols v. Gladden, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 497</cite>, 23 S.E. 459 (1895) (decided under prior
                            law).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rule has never been abolished in North Carolina, and this section does not affect that principle of law. Dawson v. Quinnerly, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 188</cite>, 24 S.E. 483 (1896); Hammer v. Brantley, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 71</cite>,
                            92 S.E.2d 424 (1956).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nature and Operation of Rule. - The rule in Shelley's case is a rule of law and not of construction, and, no matter what the intention of the grantor or testator may have been, if an estate is granted or given to one for life and after his death to his
                            heirs or "heirs of his body," and no other words are superadded which to a certainty show that other persons than the heirs general of the first taker are meant, the rule applies and the whole estate vests in the first taker.
                            Nichols v. Gladden, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 497</cite>, 23 S.E. 459 (1895).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the conveyance is to the first taker for life and then by whatever language employed to his bodily heirs or heirs of his body, the rule in Shelley's case applies and the first taker acquires a fee. Whitson v. Barnett,
                            <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 483</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 391 (1953).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a devise is to a named person for life with remainder after his death to "his heirs" or "his bodily heirs" or the "heirs of his body," nothing else appearing, the devisee becomes seized of a fee simple estate upon the death of the testator subject
                            to any prior life estate created by the will. Hammer v. Brantley, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 71</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 424 (1956).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rule in Shelley's case operates as a rule of property without regard to the intent of the grantor or devisor. Wright v. Vaden, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 299</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 31 (1966).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rule in Shelley's case applies to personalty as well as to realty. Wright v. Vaden, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 299</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 31 (1966).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whenever applicable, the rule in Shelley's case applies to both real and personal property in this jurisdiction. Ray v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 715</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 185 (1967).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Limitation within Rule Passes a Fee Simple. - A limitation coming within the rule in Shelley's case, recognized as existent in this State, operates as a rule of property, passing when applicable a fee simple, both in deeds and wills, regardless of a contrary
                            intent on the part of the testator or grantor appearing in the instrument. Wallace v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 158</cite>, 106 S.E. 501 (1921).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Difference between Words of Purchase and Words of Limitation. - In considering the applicability of the rule in Shelley's case, it is important to draw and constantly keep in mind the difference between words of purchase and words of limitation. Wright
                            v. Vaden, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 299</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 31 (1966).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the rule in Shelley's case says that the words "heirs" or the "heirs of the body" of A are words of limitation and not words of purchase, it simply means that "heirs" or the "heirs of the body" refer to and are read in connection with the estate
                            given to A, extending or modifying that estate, and are not taken as describing a group to whom an estate will first attach. Wright v. Vaden, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 299</cite>, 146 S.E.2d
                            31 (1966).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Heirs" or "Heirs of the Body". - The words "heirs" or "heirs of the body" must be taken in their technical sense, or carry the estate to the entire line of heirs to hold as inheritors under our canons of descent; but should these words be used as only
                            designating certain persons, or confining the inheritance to a restricted class of heirs, the rule does not apply, and the ancestor or the first taker acquires only a life estate according to the meaning of the express words
                            of the instrument. Wallace v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 158</cite>, 106 S.E. 501 (1921).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rule in Shelley's case applies whenever judicial exposition determines that heirs are described, though informally, under a term correctly descriptive of other objects, but stands excluded whenever it determines that other objects are described, though
                            informally, under the term heirs. Wright v. Vaden, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 299</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 31 (1966).

                            Deed Sufficient Formerly to Convey Fee Tail. - A deed, which was sufficient under the old law to confer a fee tail, is sufficient under this section, where a contrary intent may not be gathered from the instrument construed as a whole, to convey an estate
                            in fee simple, but such a deed must be distinguished from a conveyance in which the words "bodily heirs" are used as descriptio personarum, which merely conveys to them an estate in remainder and as purchasers from the grantor.
                            Harrington v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 76</cite>, 79 S.E. 301 (1913). See Whitfield v. Garriss, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 24</cite>, 45 S.E. 904 (1903); Jones v. Ragsdale,

                            Conveyance to One and Heirs of the Body. - A conveyance of land to A and "her heirs by the body of R (her husband) and assigns forever" was a fee tail at common law, but under this section it is converted into a fee simple absolute, unaffected by the
                            fact that there were children of the marriage living at the time of the execution of the conveyance; and in this case, construing the instrument as a whole, it evidences the intent of the grantor that it should be so interpreted.
                            Revis v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 579</cite>, 90 S.E. 573 (1916); Whitley v. Arenson, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 121</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 906 (1941).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If testatrix intended to use the term in its strict technical sense, a devise to one and his "bodily heirs" would violate the rule against perpetuities, or might create a fee tail, and in either case a fee simple would vest in the first taker. Elledge
                            v. Parrish, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 397</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 314 (1944).

                        <p>
                            An estate to H during his life, with remainder to the testator's son "and his bodily heirs," vests a life estate in the land in H, with an estate tail in remainder to the son, which, under our statute, is converted into a fee simple. And upon the falling
                            in of the life estate, the son can convey a good fee simple title. Howard v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 604</cite>, 116 S.E. 1 (1923), distinguishing Leathers v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 162</cite>,

                            A devise to A for life and at her death to the heirs of her body presents a classic case for application of the rule in Shelley's case. Ray v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 715</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 185 (1967).

                            By a devise to A for life and at her death to the heirs of her body, the rule in Shelley's case, and the doctrine of merger, give A an estate tail which this section converts into a fee simple. Ray v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 715</cite>,

                            Where a testatrix devised and bequeathed all her property to her daughter during her lifetime and at her death to the "heirs of her body, if any," with further provision that if the daughter should die before testatrix without heirs of the body, the property
                            should go to named collateral kin, the daughter took a fee tail under the rule in Shelley's case, which was converted into a fee simple by this section. Ray v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 715</cite>,

                            Child Adopted by Unmarried Daughter. - Where will provided for remainder interest to an unmarried daughter "to have and to hold the same to her and the heirs of her body," any child adopted by her would satisfy the conditions of the will and could inherit

                            which estate is converted into a fee simple by this section, and the daughter had power to dispose of the property by will. Davis v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 116</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 334

                            When the devise is to one for life and after his death to his children or issue, the rule in Shelley's case has no application, unless it manifestly appears that such words are used in the sense of heirs generally. Wright v. Vaden,

                            "wanted" the land to go to their "children &amp; so on", the brother took a life estate with remainder to his children and the named grandson in fee under the rule in Shelley's case, since it is apparent that testatrix used
                            the word "children" in the sense of an indefinite line of succession and created an estate tail converted into a fee by this section. Wilson v. Spain, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 482</cite>, 133

                            into a defeasible fee simple, and, even though the wife conveyed her present life estate interest to her daughter, the daughter's interest could only be defeated in the event that she died without having children. Russell v.

                            the canons of descent, but as words designating certain persons, the rule in Shelley's case does not apply. Whitson v. Barnett, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 483</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 391 (1953).

                            Where the conveyance was made "to Roy Whitson and bodily heirs, and their heirs and assigns," Roy Whitson being the father of four children, it was held that the words "bodily heirs" were intended to mean children and not heir general in the technical

                            Conveyance to Husband and Wife for Life Then to Heirs of the Body of Wife. - A deed conveyed to husband and wife a life estate and expressed grantor's intent to convey only a lifetime right to said grantees, with provision that said grantees should have
                            and hold said tract of land during their natural lives and then to the heirs of the body of the feme grantee. It was held that the husband took only a life estate, and the conveyance being to the wife and then to heirs of her
                            body, the rule in Shelley's case applied, and the estate in fee tail conveyed to the wife was converted by this section into a fee simple absolute. Edgerton v. Harrison, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 158</cite>,

                            that the words "male heirs" should be construed "heirs" under the provisions of this section, the addition of the words "share and share alike" prevents the application of the rule in Shelley's case, and upon the death of the
                            son, his sole male heir takes the fee in the property by purchase under the will. Cheshire v. Drewry, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 450</cite>, 197 S.E. 1 (1938).

                            Devise to Grandchildren for Their Lives, Then "to Their Bodily Heirs". - The rule in Shelley's case does not apply to a devise to testator's grandchildren during the term of their natural lives, then "to their bodily heirs, or issue surviving them," with
                            limitation over of the share of any grandchild who should die without issue to his next of kin, since it is apparent that the word "heirs" was not used in its technical sense, and the grandchildren take only a life estate.
                            Williams v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 732</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 24 (1948).

                        <p>
                            The use of the word "children" following the life estate does not create a fee simple estate or fee tail estate which would be converted by this section into a fee simple estate where a will devises real estate to the three daughters of testator, naming
                            them, "during the time of their natural lives" and provides that "the share of each one of my said daughters shall upon her death go to her children and their heirs absolutely," for the word "children" is a word of purchase.

                            "Lawful Heirs". - Where a devise is to one for life and then to his "lawful heirs," the word "lawful," qualifying the word "heirs," does not have the effect of preventing the latter word from operating as one of limitation and of restricting the meaning
                            of the words "lawful heirs" to that of "children," who will take not by descent from their parent, but by purchase from the devisor. Wool v. Fleetwood, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 460</cite>,

                            "Heirs, if Any". - A conveyance to one for "his lifetime, and at his death to his heirs, if any," invokes the application of the rule in Shelley's case and vests a fee in the first taker. The use of the phrase "if any" does not prevent the application
                            of the rule, since there is no limitation over. Glover v. Glover, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 152</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 350 (1944).

                            Devise "for Life Only". - A devise of lands to the testator's named children "for life only and then to their body heirs," falls within the rule in Shelley's case, notwithstanding the use of the words "for life only," and carries to the remainderman a
                            fee tail under the old law, converted by our statute into a fee simple title. Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Dortch, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 510</cite>, 120 S.E. 60 (1923), citing Harrington v. Grimes,

                            Reverter upon Death without Surviving Heirs. - The interpretation that a deed for life and then to "the surviving heirs of her body" conveys the fee simple title, under this section, does not apply when the grantor uses the additional words, "but should
                            she die without leaving such heir or heirs, then the same is to revert back to her nearest of kin according to law," for then the intent is manifest that the conveyance is of a defeasible fee depending upon whether the first
                            taker died without leaving children surviving her. Smith v. Parke, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 406</cite>, 97 S.E. 209 (1918).

                        <p>
                            A devise to testator's daughter and her bodily heirs, and if she dies without bodily heirs, then in trust for the heirs of testator's sisters, is held to create a fee simple estate in the daughter, defeasible upon her dying without children or issue,
                            it being apparent that the words "bodily heirs" used in the devise meant children or issue, as otherwise the limitation over to the heirs of testator's sisters would be meaningless. Murdock v. Deal,
                            <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 754</cite>, 182 S.E. 466 (1935).

                            Where land is devised to a person for life at her death to vest in the testator's children during their natural lives and at their death to vest in their lawful heirs, and should they leave no lawful heirs, then to the testator's lawful heirs, such children
                            take a fee simple absolute on the death of the life tenant. Wool v. Fleetwood, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 460</cite>, 48 S.E. 785 (1904).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Where a testator devises realty to a grandson, and upon the grandson's death without children, then the realty to descend to other grandchildren, such devise vests a fee simple estate in the first devisee, defeasible only on condition that he die without
                            leaving heirs of his body. Whitefield v. Garriss, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 24</cite>, 45 S.E. 904 (1903).

                            When Defeasible Estate Becomes Absolute. - A conveyance to a granddaughter and the heirs of her own body passed an estate in fee tail, which by this section was converted into a fee simple, defeasible under the terms of the deed if no child was born to
                            her, but which became absolute upon the birth of a child. Sharpe v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 294</cite>, 98 S.E. 825 (1919). See Paul v. Paul, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 522</cite>,

                        <p>
                            An estate in remainder to the testator's son "and to his children or issue, but in case he should die childless and without issue, then . . . to my heirs in equal degree in fee simple," there being no child or children of the son until long after the
                            testator's death, was held to create an estate tail at common law, which was converted into a fee simple by this section, defeasible upon the testator's son dying without issue, and as there was an ultimate limitation over
                            to persons coming within its terms, the testator's son and his child or issue could not convey a fee simple title. Ziegler v. Love, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 40</cite>, 115 S.E. 887 (1923).

                            Joint Tenancy Severed by Deed of Trust. - When a mortgagee sought to foreclose on land held by a daughter and son-in-law and the daughter's mother, a trial court properly ruled that the son-in-law and daughter owned a one-half undivided interest in the
                            land which was not encumbered by a deed of trust to the benefit of the mortgagee because, after the son-in-law and daughter and the mother executed a general warranty deed creating a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship
                            between the mother and the son-in-law and daughter, that joint tenancy was severed by the filing of a deed of trust which only obligated the mother, as the accompanying mortgage was a conveyance, due to North Carolina being
                            a title theory state, so the mother, on one hand, and the son-in-law and daughter, on the other hand, held the land as tenants in common. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v.

                            Instrument Held Ineffective to Provide for Survivorship. - While this section may not preclude tenants in common from providing for survivorship by adequate contract inter sese, an instrument executed by them which merely expresses a general intent that
                            the survivor should take the fee, without any words of conveyance, is ineffective. The execution by the administrator of the deceased tenant in common of a deed to the surviving tenant, made under the supposed authority of
                            the contract, is without effect. Pope v. Burgess, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 323</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 159 (1949).

                            passed to the son-in-law and daughter upon the mother's death because the mother's interest as a tenant in common had no right of survivorship, since a joint tenancy previously created by a general warranty deed was severed

                            interest as a tenant in common was one-half of the property, and the son-in-law's and daughter's interest, as tenants by the entirety, was also one-half because the son-in-law and daughter were husband and wife, so the son-in-law
                            and daughter held the property as a single tenancy by the entirety and were treated as a single party when determining interests in the joint tenancy with right of survivorship upon severance of the joint tenancy. Countrywide

                            for possession for the purpose of winding up the partnership affairs, when it appears that the partnership personalty is sufficient for the purpose of paying the partnership debts and satisfying any claim the surviving partner
                            may have, and there is no provision in the articles of the partnership agreement of a contrary purpose. Sherrod v. Mayo, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 144</cite>, 72 S.E. 216 (1911).

                            Immaterial Whether Claim Is by Deed or Inheritance. - When the rule applies that lands purchased by partnership funds descend to the heir at law, it is immaterial whether the heir of the deceased partner claims his interest by deed from him or by inheritance.

                            The fact that the surviving partner instituting action on a partnership asset has not filed a bond as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.059.html#t59a03s59-74" target="_blank">G.S. 59-74</a></cite>, is
                            not ground for nonsuit, since the requirement of a bond is for the protection of the estate of the deceased partner, and the objection is not available to one who is merely a debtor of the partnership. This conclusion is consonant
                            with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.059.html#t59a03s59-75" target="_blank">G.S. 59-75</a></cite>, which provides that upon failure of the surviving partner to file bond, the clerk of the superior court shall

                        Written agreement not signed by party asserting rights as a survivor is not sufficient to satisfy statutory requirements of subsection (a) of this section. In re Estate of Heffner, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 327,

                        Plain language of this section clearly requires that both parties sign a written agreement. In re Estate of Heffner, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 392 S.E.2d 770 (1990)decided under law in effect prior to G.S.

                        A certificate of deposit did not itself constitute compliance with subsection (a) of this section since the certificate did not contain the signatures of the depositors and thus did not amount to a signed writing as contemplated by the statute. The provision
                        of the certificate, "Payable to said depositor, or, if more than one, to either or any of said depositors or the survivors or survivor," absent any other evidence, was not dispositive as to the ownership of funds. The use of the
                        conjunction "or" in the certificate did not establish the right of survivorship but merely created an agency for the one other than the depositor to withdraw funds, such agency terminating at depositor's death. O'Brien v. Reece,
                        <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 263 S.E.2d 817 (1980).

                    <p>
                        Nor Did Signature Card Signed by Depositors. - A signature card signed by depositors did not comply with this section where the card did not expressly provide for the right of survivorship in the certificate of deposit in that there was no indication
                        in the space provided on the signature card that gave effect to the survivorship provision. O'Brien v. Reece, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 263 S.E.2d 817 (1980).

                        Where signature cards for savings and loan association accounts designated both parties "as joint tenants with right of survivorship" and instructed the savings and loan association "to act pursuant to any one or more of the joint tenants' signatures,
                        shown below, in any manner in connection with this account and, . . . to pay, without any liability for such payment, to any one or the survivor or survivors at any time," the withdrawal clause indicating that withdrawals were
                        to be made only by the deceased party would be disregarded and the contractual terms allowing both parties the right to act in any manner regarding the account controlled. McLain v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite>                        275, 371 S.E.2d 151 (1988), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 328</cite>, 377 S.E.2d 749 (1989).

                        Survivorship Account Not Created. - Where the materials of the parties showed without contradiction that though plaintiff and codepositor intended to establish a joint savings account with the right of survivorship, codepositor died before signing the
                        agreement, the statutory terms for creating a survivorship account were not complied with, and plaintiff's action seeking the release of funds held in the savings account, titled in his name and that of the decedent, had no basis.

                    <p>
                        No Trust Created. - Where deceased opened a savings account and on the application form wrote, "Payable to Rose Z. Weaver, as survivor only," there was no trust created with right of survivorship, since there was no evidence of a transfer or assignment
                        of a present beneficial interest but only the expression of a desire that plaintiff own the account at the death of the depositor. Kyle v. Groce, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 204, 272 S.E.2d

                        Change of Joint Account. - Where plaintiff and his former wife executed a joint account agreement with right of survivorship pursuant to this section, the joint account could be changed only by the signatures of all the parties to the joint account agreement
                        or by one party's withdrawing the complete account and opening a new account. This section does not permit only one of the joint tenants of the account in question to change it from the original agreement executed by both parties
                        to the detriment of the other. Benfield v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 371, 261 S.E.2d 150 (1979).

        Abstention by Bankruptcy Court.
       </b> - In a bankruptcy action concerning the issue of rights of ownership in a joint bank account with rights of survivorship, the bankruptcy court refused to rule on the issue since it was clearly one of state law requiring
                        state expertise and, thus, the issue was one of unsettled North Carolina law on which a court of that state should have made a ruling. Kimrey v. Dorsett, 10 Bankr. 466 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1981).

                        Liability for Wrongful Conversion. - This section and the signature card serve only to discharge the bank from liability to its depositors; they do not release one depositor to a joint account from liability to another for a withdrawal which constitutes
                        wrongful conversion. Myers v. Myers, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 177, 314 S.E.2d 809 (1984).

                        Purpose of Section. - This section was enacted for the primary purpose of making contingent limitations good by fixing a definite time when the estate of the first taker shall become absolute, and also to establish a rule of interpretation by which the
                        estate of the first taker shall be affected with the contingency till the time of his death unless a contrary intent appears on the face of the instrument. Sain v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 256</cite>,

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The primary purpose of the enactment of this section was not to abrogate the rule which favors the early vesting of estates but it has been given that effect under certain circumstances in the North Carolina decisions. Cabarrus Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.
                        Finlayson, 286 F.2d 251 (4th Cir. 1961).

                    <p>
                        This section was enacted in 1827 to meet the rule then generally prevailing in this country that a gift over on "death without issue" in a deed or will meant an indefinite failure of issue and hence was void for remoteness. Cabarrus Bank &amp; Trust Co.
                        v. Finlayson, 286 F.2d 251 (4th Cir. 1961).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this section is to save gifts over upon the contingency of someone's dying without issue if the contingency occurs after the death of the testator or after some estate or period subsequent to his death. White v. Alexander,
                        <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 75</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 617 (1976).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this section is to sustain the contingent interest created by the testator and ensure that the interest will pass in possession when and if the contingency occurs, even if the occurrence is after the death of the testator. Therefore, when
                        the contingency is fulfilled the limitation is deemed to take effect. Hollowell v. Hollowell, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 420 S.E.2d 827, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 706</cite>,

                        Does Not Interfere with Rule in Shelley's Case. - The section does not interfere with the application of the principle laid down in Shelley's case in determining the nature and extent of the precedent estate. This is declared in Sanderlin v. Deford,
                        <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. 74</cite> (1854), in construing a will executed in 1838. King v. Utley, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 59</cite> (1881).

                        Doctrine of Shifting Uses and Executory Devises Unaffected. - This section is a rule of construction upholding the second and contingent estate upon the death of the first taker without heirs, etc., and does not change the application of the doctrine
                        of shifting uses and executory devises in determining the nature and extent of the precedent estate. Sessoms v. Sessoms, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 121</cite>, 56 S.E. 687 (1907).

                    <p>
                        Common-Law Rule Superseded. - Where there was a devise of lands for life, then to J and C equally, and in case "they or either of them die without issue," then to the heirs of certain others and the survivor of J and C equally, it was held that the common-law
                        doctrine that a limitation contingent upon death and failure of issue is void for remoteness gives place to the new rule of construction enacted by this section, made applicable since January 15, 1828, without restriction as to
                        immediate estates, and a contrary intent not being expressly and plainly declared in the face of the instrument, the death without issue referred to the death of J and C; and it appearing that J died without issue after the death
                        of the first taker, and C survived, with issue, the absolute fee simple title to the lands was in C and the other ulterior remaindermen. Patterson v. McCormick, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 448</cite>,
                        99 S.E. 401 (1919).

                    <p>
                        Rule When Will Is Ambiguous. - Where there is ambiguity in a will as to whether the vesting of an estate devised for life with contingent limitation over shall be at the death of the testatrix or that of the first taker, under the principle that the law
                        favors the early vesting of estates, the former will be taken; and where it clearly appears from the terms of the will and surrounding circumstances that that was the intent of the testatrix, it will not be affected by the section,
                        by which a contingent limitation depending upon the dying of a person without heir, etc., is to vest at the death of such person. Westfeldt v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 802</cite>, 133 S.E.

                        Provisions of Section Prevail over Rule of Stare Decisis. - A vested interest in lands cannot be established under the doctrine of stare decisis in direct conflict with the expressions of a statutory change of the rule to the contrary, where the decisions
                        relied upon are upon a construction of a written instrument made or executed before the statutory enactment and excepted by it from its provisions, and the subsequent decisions of affirmance of the old rule of construction are
                        either conflicting among themselves or upon prior executed instruments excepted by the statute, or without express reference thereto; and this section, changing the rule of construction as to the vesting of an interest contingent
                        upon a death with issue, cannot be affected by the rule laid down in Hilliard v. Kearney, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. 221</cite> (1853), and subsequent decisions on the subject. Patterson v. McCormick,

                        The law favors early indefeasible or absolute vesting of estates. As a corollary of this rule, such a construction is to be put upon conditional expressions, which render a testamentary gift defeasible, as to confine their operation to as early a period
                        as the words of the will allow, so that it may become an absolute interest as soon as the language of the testator will permit. Elmore v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 13</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 205 (1950);

                        Contingent Remaindermen Take Transmissible Estate. - Where there is a contingent executory devise to named persons in the event the first taker should die without issue, the persons who are to take the contingent limitation over are certain and only the
                        event upon which they are to take is uncertain, and the contingent remaindermen take a transmissible estate which is not dependent upon their surviving the first taker, and upon the death of the contingent remaindermen prior to
                        the death of the first taker without children then surviving, the estate goes to the heirs, next of kin, and successors of interest of the contingent remaindermen. Seawell v. Cheshire, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 629</cite>,

                        The words that the gift over "shall be . . . a limitation to take effect when such person dies not having such heir or issue, or child . . . living at the time of his death, or born to him within ten lunar months thereafter" mean simply that the interest
                        will be sustained and will pass in possession when and if the contingency, e.g., dying without issue, occurs, even if this event takes place after the death of the testator or grantor or after some intervening estate or period
                        following his death. White v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 75</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 617 (1976).

                        This section does not operate to postpone vesting of the reversion until the death of the life tenant without children because a reversion is not an estate created by limitation in a deed or will but is an estate created by operation of law. Atkins v.

                        Where a will set up a trust with provision that the income therefrom be divided among named beneficiaries for life and the corpus proportionately to their issue upon their deaths, with further provision that if a beneficiary should die without issue,
                        his share of the corpus should become a part of, and be distributed in accordance with, the residuary clause, it was held that the person entitled to each share of the corpus was contingent upon whether each of the life beneficiaries
                        died with or without issue surviving, and therefore the will set up a contingent and not a vested limitation, and the roll must be called as to each share of the corpus as of the death of its life beneficiary. Van Winkle v. Berger,

                        will continue to affect it till the event occurs by which same is to be determined, or the estate becomes absolute. Patterson v. McCormick, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 448</cite>, 99 S.E. 401 (1919).

                        Rule in Hilliard v. Kearney Changed. - Under the rule at common law a limitation contingent upon death without issue was void for remoteness because it referred to an indefinite failure of issue; and in order to give effect to the testator's intention
                        the courts began to look for some intermediate time, such as the termination of the life estate, or some other designated period, and held that the phrase "dying without issue" was to be referred to this intermediate period. Hilliard

                        upon his death without having a living child born in wedlock, but which becomes a fee simple absolute as to each son upon the birth of him of a living child in wedlock. Buffaloe v. Blalock, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 105</cite>,

                        By residuary clause, testator devised the remainder of his estate to his four sons, his sole heirs at law, each to take a defeasible fee to become absolute as to each upon the birth of a living child in wedlock. It was held that testator intended to dispose
                        of all the residue of his estate in the residuary clause, including any reversion, and therefore if the fee of any one of the sons should be defeated, the reversion would go to the estate and pass under the residuary clause to
                        the other sons or their heirs, who would not take as purchasers under the will but by descent from the devisees, and therefore deed executed by the four sons conveys the fee simple absolute, since the deed of each would estop him
                        or his heirs from claiming any reversionary interest if such interest should thereafter arise. Buffaloe v. Blalock, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 105</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 625 (1950).

                        Testator devised a life estate to his wife with provisions that at her death his lands should be divided among his living children, with particular description as to the share each should take, with further provision that one daughter (who had living
                        children at the time the will was executed) should take a life estate in her share with remainder to her children, and that his other named daughter and three named sons should have their share in fee simple forever "And if either
                        one of my daughters shall die without issue, their share of the lands shall be equally divided among" the three named sons. It was held that the words "shall die without issue" refer to the death of the devisees of the fee and
                        not to the death of the life tenant, and the daughters took a defeasible fee so that upon the death of one of them without issue her surviving, her share became vested in the three named sons. House v. House,

                        Where testatrix bequeathed property to her daughter or to the children of testatrix's son if the daughter should die childless, the daughter took only a defeasible title which terminated upon her death without children. Cabarrus Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.
                        Finlayson, 286 F.2d 251 (4th Cir. 1961).

                        Instance of Fee Simple Determinable. - Testator devised lands to his daughter with further provision that the gift should become absolute if she improved the land by erecting a dwelling or if she should die leaving issue, but that if she should fail to
                        improve the lot or should die without living issue, then the lands should be disposed of as directed in a subsequent item. It was held that the devise created a fee simple determinable, and under the rule of construction requiring
                        that the fee simple absolute should vest as soon as the language of the testator permits, the ambiguous provisions for defeasance must be read so as to require both of the specified contingencies to occur before the fee should
                        be defeated, and therefore upon the erection of a dwelling house upon the property of the daughter her fee became absolute. Elmore v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 13</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 205 (1950).

                        Estate Created Direct to Second Taker. - When by the operation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a01s41-1" target="_self">G.S. 41-1</a></cite> a fee tail is converted into a fee simple, with a limitation of a fee upon the death
                        of the first taker without heirs, a separate estate is created direct from the testator to the second taker upon the happening of the contingency, under the doctrine of shifting uses and by way of executory devise, and is not a
                        qualification of the estate of the first taker, or too remote since the enactment of this section. Sessoms v. Sessoms, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 121</cite>, 56 S.E. 687 (1907).

                        A devise of lands to B in fee, "provided he has a child or children; but if he has no child, then to him for life," with limitation over to the testator's heirs at law, carries to the devisee a fee simple estate, defeasible upon his death without having
                        had a child, the contingent event by which the estate is determined referring to the death of the devisee and holder of the prior estate unless a contrary intent clearly appears from the will itself; and upon the death of B and
                        the nonhappening of the contingency named, the inheritance passes directly from the testator to the ultimate devisees. Burden v. Lipsitz, <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. 523</cite>, 82 S.E. 863 (1914).

                        heirs, said lands shall go back to my estate," will go over to the heirs of the grantor at the death of M, upon the nonhappening of the event, as a shifting use under the statute of uses, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a01s41-7" target="_self">G.S. 41-7</a></cite>,
                        whereunder a fee may be limited after a fee, by deed, and under the provisions of this section that every contingent limitation in a deed or will made to depend upon the dying of any person without heir or heirs of the body, or
                        issue, shall be held to be a limitation to take effect when such person dies not having such heir, or issue, or child living at the time of his death. Willis v. Mutual Loan &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 267</cite>,

                        An estate to testator's daughter N for life, and to the lawful heirs of her body, creates an estate tail converted by our statute into a fee simple; and a further limitation "and if she should die leaving no heirs, then the lands to return to the G family,"
                        gives N a fee defeasible upon her death without issue, children, etc., under this section, and on her death, leaving children surviving, they take an unconditional fee, and can make an absolute conveyance thereof. Vinson v. Gardner,

                        Where a father devised the land in question to plaintiff "to be hers and to her heirs, if any, and if no heirs, to be equally divided with my other children," and at the time plaintiff executed deed to defendant, which was refused by him, plaintiff was
                        married, but had been abandoned by her husband, and had no children, it was held that the plaintiff's deed did not convey the indefeasible fee to the land free and clear of the claims of all persons, whether the limitation over
                        be regarded as a limitation over on failure of issue, or as not coming within the rule in Shelley's case. Hudson v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 338</cite>, 180 S.E. 597 (1935).

     The cases under this section were decided prior to the enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a01s41-6.3" target="_self">G.S. 41-6.3</a></cite>, which abolished the rule in Shelley's case.

                            Purpose of Section. - It seems that the main object of this section is to convert a contingent into a vested remainder under certain circumstances. It seems also to have been the purpose of the act to sustain a direct conveyance to the heirs of a living
                            person. As there can be no heirs during the life of the ancestor, such a conveyance at common law would have been void unless there was something in the deed which indicated that by "the heirs" was meant the children of the
                            person named. This section provides that in such a case the word "heirs" shall be construed to mean "children" and the limitation therefore would be good. By this construction of the section it does not affect the rule in Shelley's
                            case. Starnes v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 1</cite>, 16 S.E. 1011 (1893); Hartman v. Flynn, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 452</cite>, 127 S.E. 517 (1925).

                            "Limitation" Explained. - The word limitation has two different senses: the original sense, namely, that of a member of a sentence, expressing the limits or bounds to the quantity of an estate; and the derivative sense, namely, that of an entire sentence,
                            creating and actually or constructively marking out the quantity of an estate. In this statute, the word is manifestly used in its derivative or secondary sense. Campbell v. Everhart, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 503</cite>,
                            52 S.E. 201 (1905). See Starnes v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 1</cite>, 16 S.E. 1011 (1893).

                            Common-Law Rule Changed. - While as a general common-law rule, subject to some exceptions, a conveyance of an estate for life in lands to another, with remainder to the heirs of the grantor, could not divest the grantor of the fee, under the rule that
                            nemo est haeres viventis, this does not prevail under the provisions of this section. Thompson v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 333</cite>, 84 S.E. 347 (1915).

                            Section Applies Only When No Precedent Estate to Said Living Person. - The Code of 1883, s. 1329, now this section, providing that a limitation to the heirs of a living person shall be construed to be the children of such person, applies only when there
                            is no precedent estate conveyed to said living person. Jones v. Ragsdale, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 200</cite>, 53 S.E. 842 (1906); Whitley v. Arenson, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 121</cite>,

                            If it were not true that this section applies only when there is no precedent estate conveyed to said living person, it would not only repeal the rule in Shelley's case, but would pervert every conveyance to "A and his heirs" into something entirely different
                            from what those words have always been understood to mean. Marsh v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 333</cite>, 48 S.E. 735 (1904).

                            Conveyance to Living Person and Limitation to Heirs. - This section applies only when there is no precedent estate conveyed to said living person, nor is this section applicable where there is a conveyance to a living person, with a limitation to his
                            heirs. Bank of Pilot Mt. v. Snow, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 14</cite>, 18 S.E.2d 711 (1942).

                            Devise to "Heirs of His Children". - By his will, the testator devised a lot to trustees for 20 years from the date of his death, and at the expiration of such term to the "heirs of his children, to be equally divided between them, per stirpes." The testator
                            left surviving two children, a son and a daughter, both of whom had children living at the date of testator's death. The son and daughter are now living. Under this section the word "heirs," as used in the will, must be construed
                            to mean "children." Lide v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 37</cite>, 128 S.E. 477 (1925).

                            A testator devised a lot to trustees for 20 years from the date of his death and provided that at the end of said period the estate should "be equally divided between the heirs of my children, per stirpes." By virtue of this section, the word "heirs"
                            as used in this item of the will, must be construed to mean the "children" of the son and daughter of the testator. Lide v. Mears, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 111</cite>, 56 S.E.2d 404 (1949).

                            "Lawful Heirs of Her Body". - Where a testator, by separate devises, gave to each of his three daughters, who were his only heirs at law, a certain tract of his land, with provision in each item "to her and the lawful heirs of her body in fee simple forever,
                            and if she should die without a lawful heir of her body, then the property to go to the other surviving heirs," by the expression, "lawful heirs of her body," in the connection used, the testator intended "child" of his daughters.
                            Kornegay v. Cunningham, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 209</cite>, 93 S.E. 754 (1917).

                            Remainder to Living Heirs of Grantor. - Grantor conveyed the land in question to her son after the reservation of a life estate, and by habendum stipulated that the grantee should have an estate for the term of his natural life and at his death to his
                            issue surviving, with further provision that should he die without issue "then to the living heirs of" the grantor. It was held that the other children of grantor have a remainder contingent upon the death of the grantee without
                            issue, which interest cannot be defeated by a conveyance executed by the grantee with the joinder of the grantor. Ellis v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 543</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 772 (1950).

                            Section Validates Conveyance Directly to Heirs of Living Person. - By virtue of the section a deed conveying land directly to the "heirs" of a living person passes whatever title the grantor had to the children of such person. Campbell v. Everhart,
                            <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 503</cite>, 52 S.E. 201 (1905).

                            A deed to "the heirs" of A, he being still alive, although void at common law, is good under this section, and is construed to be a limitation to the children of A, and includes after-born children. Graves v. Barrett,
                            <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 267</cite>, 35 S.E. 539 (1900).

                            An estate granted to D for life and then to the heirs of S, who was then alive, is operative as to the conveyance of the remainder under Revival, s. 1583, now this section, which construes the word "heirs" to mean children, in such instances. Condor v.
                            Secrest, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 201</cite>, 62 S.E. 921 (1908).

                            Child Born during Life of Life Tenant. - A devise was of lands to the widow of the testator for life, then to the heirs of his son J, and it appeared that the son was living at the time and had living children at the death of the testator and one born
                            thereafter, during the continuance of the life estate. It was held that the devise, being to the heirs of a living person, conveyed such interest to the children of the person designated, and being, in terms, to a class, it
                            included all who were members of the class and filled the description at the time the particular estate terminated, and therefore the child born after the death of the testator, but during the lifetime of the tenant for life,
                            took his share with the other children of J. Cooley v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 18</cite>, 86 S.E. 720 (1915).

                            Limitation to Heirs of One with Conditional Limitation Over. - Where an estate was devised to A "and the heirs of his body, but if he die without heirs living at the time of his death, then to the heirs of B," "heirs" was construed to mean children. Smith

                            Limitation over Provided First Taker Dies Without Heirs. - Where a testator devises land to his son with a limitation over to his daughters, provided the son dies without heirs, the word "heirs" is construed to mean "children." Sain v. Baker,
                            <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 256</cite>, 38 S.E. 858 (1901).

                        <p>
                            Where a devise of lands is limited over should the first taker die without heirs, evidencing that the intent of the testator made the contingency to depend upon the first taker's dying without issue, this section has no application. Massengill v. Abell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 240</cite>, 134 S.E. 641 (1926).

                            Contingent Remainder Interests. - Trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of a second son's children because they received nothing under their great-grandfather's (testator) will and their grantees received deeds from persons who had no
                            interest in the property where the will created contingent remainder interests in the testator's children that were satisfied and the property reverted to the testator's heirs, inter alia, upon the death of his first son without
                            lineal descendants. Barnes v. Scull, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 184, 765 S.E.2d 820 (2014).

                            Reverter to Heirs upon Nonhappening of Contingency. - A conveyance of land in contemplation of marriage, to M, "to descend to the heirs of the body of the said M in fee simple, the issue of such marriage, and on failure of issue to revert to the heirs
                            of" the grantor, the "reverter" to his heirs under this section meant to his children after the death of his wife and the nonhappening of the stated contingency. Thompson v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 333</cite>,
                            84 S.E. 347 (1915).

                            "Lawfully Begotten Heirs of the Body". - It was held that "the lawfully begotten heirs of her body" in a will referred most obviously to the children of the devisee for life, of whom there were only two, and was construed to mean "the children of such
                            person" since contrary intention did not appear from the will. Lockman v. Hobbs, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 541</cite>, 4 S.E. 627 (1887).

                            When Children Illegitimate. - Where a bequest is immediate - not dependent upon a preceding limited estate - to the heirs of a living person, and the children of such person are illegitimate, they have the right to take under the section which declares
                            that a limitation to the "heirs" shall be construed to be the "children" of such person, unless a contrary intention appears. Howell v. Tyler, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 207</cite> (1884).

                        <p>
                            History of Section. - It is conceded, on all hands, that the Statute of Uses, 27 Hen. VIII, c. 10, was in force and in use, in this State, up to the passage of the Revised Statutes (1836). Indeed, all of the conveyances of land adopted and used in this
                            State are based on, and take effect by, the operation of that statute. In the Rev. Stat., c. 43, s. 4, and the Rev. Code, c. 43, s. 6, the words used in 27 Hen. VIII, c. 10, i.e., "When one person or persons stand, or be seized,
                            or at any time thereafter shall happen to be seized of land, etc., to the use of any other person, persons, or body politic, by reason of any bargain, sale, feoffment, etc., or otherwise, by any manner or means whatsoever it
                            be, the persons, etc., having the use, shall have the legal estate, etc.," are omitted and the provision is simply "By deed of bargain and sale, lease and release and covenant to stand seized, the possession shall be transferred
                            to the bargainee, releasee, covenantee, etc." Substantially in this form the section is carried through all the various codes up to this one. The tendency, while no material change has been made, has been to make the section
                            all inclusive by extending its application to every possible case involving the principle. Wilder v. Ireland, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. 85</cite> (1860).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Possession Transferred. - The statute of uses, substituted for 27 Hen. VIII, now this section, provides that the possession of the bargainor shall be transferred to the bargainee as perfectly as if the bargainee "had been enfeoffed at common law with
                            the livery of seizin of the land intended to be conveyed, etc." Kirby v. Boyette, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 244</cite>, 24 S.E. 18 (1896).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Same Footing with Feoffments at Common Law. - Deeds of bargain and sale, and covenants to stand seized to uses, are put on the same footing with feoffments at common law, with respect to seizin, the declaration of uses thereon, and the consideration.
                            Ivey v. Granberry, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 223</cite> (1872); Love v. Harbin, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 249</cite> (1882).

                        <p>
                            A use may be limited on a use. Rowland v. Rowland, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 214</cite> (1885).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Necessity of Consideration. - A deed of bargain and sale is governed in this State by the same principles which were applied to it in England. It must have a pecuniary, or other valuable, consideration. Blount v. Blount,
                            <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. 389</cite> (1816); Brocket v. Foscue, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. 64</cite> (1820); Bruce v. Faucett, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. 391</cite> (1857).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If no consideration, either good or valuable, appears on the face of the instrument, or can be proved aliunde, the instrument will be void. Springs v. Hanks, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. 30</cite> (1844); Jackson v. Hampton,
                            <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. 457</cite> (1848); Bruce v. Faucett, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. 391</cite> (1857).

                        <p>
                            Resulting Use at Common Law. - At common law, where there was no consideration, the use would result to the feoffor, unless the declaration of the use or trust was contemporaneous with the transmutation of the legal title. Pittman v. Pittman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 159</cite>, 12 S.E. 61 (1890).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Love and Affection as Consideration. - Though in form a deed is one of bargain and sale, yet if the only consideration is that of love and affection, it will operate as a covenant to stand seized. Slade v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. 326</cite>                            (1796); Hatch v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. 411</cite> (1832); Cobb v.

                            Where Legal and Equitable Title in Same Person. - Where one who has an equitable title acquires the legal title so that the same becomes united in the same person, the former is merged in the latter, and numerous decisions elsewhere are to the same effect.
                            Peacock v. Stott, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 149</cite>, 7 S.E. 885 (1888), petition to rehear dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 154</cite>, 10 S.E. 456 (1889); Odom v. Morgan,

                            Exceptions to Rule That Beneficial Use Is Converted into Legal Ownership. - Where one person is seized to the use of another, the statute carries the legal estate to the person having the use. But three classes of cases are made exceptions to its operation,
                            i.e.: (1) Where a use is limited on a use, (2) where a trustee is not seized but only possessed of a chattel interest, and (3) where the purposes of the trust make it necessary for the legal estate and the use to remain separate,
                            as in the case of land conveyed for the separate use and maintenance of a married woman. Wilder v. Ireland, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. 85</cite> (1860); Kirby v. Boyette, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 244</cite>,
                            24 S.E. 18 (1896).

                        <p>
                            An estate of freehold to commence in futuro can be conveyed by a deed of bargain and sale operating under this section, or by executory devise; therefore, an estate to H for life and at her death to her children in fee, reserving a life estate to the
                            grantor, is good. Savage v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 320</cite> (1884).

                            Covenant to Stand Seized on Death of Grantor. - Where there was a conveyance of real property upon the consideration of love and affection, reserving a life estate to the donor, it was held by the court that the conveyance was good; that it was a conveyance
                            to stand seized to the use of the vendee on the death of the donor. Davenport v. Wynne, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. 128</cite> (1845). To the same effect in Hodges v. Spicer, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. 223</cite>                            (1878).

                            There cannot be the least doubt but that a covenant to stand seized to the use of another, after his own life, is good to pass the estate intended; for the law raises in the grantor an estate for life in the meantime to support the future estate. This
                            has been decided in a vast number of instances. There is no point better established by the authorities. Sasser v. Blyth, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. 340</cite> (1796), overruling Ward v. Ward,

                            Life Estate to Woman with Limitation Over to Children. - Where one devised, in 1828, to a trustee, to the use and benefit of a woman, for her life, remainder to the use of all her children, it was held that the legal estate in the remainder, by force
                            of the statute, passed to the children she had at the time of the devise, subject to the participation of such as she might thereafter have. Wilder v. Ireland, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. 85</cite>                            (1860).

                            the first estate in the use; and the case is much stronger where the power of appointment is given to a stranger. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. 135</cite> (1853); Bruce v. Faucett,

                            As to the wife's life estate, so long as her husband lived, it was necessary that the trust for her separate use and maintenance should continue, as it was then active; but when her husband died, and the disability of coverture was removed, and there
                            was no longer any necessity for a trustee to protect her interest, and as the trust then became passive, the statute executed the use and united the legal and equitable estates in her. Lee v. Oates,

                            Where conveyance of wife's property to trustee for her sole use and benefit during her life and, after her death, for the benefit of her husband was ineffective to create any estate or trust in favor of the husband because of noncompliance with a former

         Rule Does Not Apply to Resulting Trust.
        </b> - Where the plaintiff cited no North Carolina authority to support the argument that the statute of uses would be operative, and since the general rule is that the statute of uses applies only to express passive
                            trusts and not to resulting or constructive trusts which arise by operation of law, under North Carolina law a resulting trust would not be executed. Greer v. United States, 448 F.2d 937 (4th Cir. 1971).

                        Remainder Not Defeated by Warranty. - A warranty in a deed of a life tenant cannot defeat the remainder of the heirs by way of rebutter. Moore v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. 123</cite> (1851); Starnes v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 1</cite>,

                        Where land is devised to a person for life, and at her death to her children, the children are not estopped by a deed with covenant of warranty executed by the life tenant. Hauser v. Craft, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 319</cite>,

                        Under this section a warranty in a deed of a life tenant does not bar or rebut the claim of heirs who can connect themselves with the outstanding remainder. This is so because such heirs take by purchase, i.e., as remaindermen, and not by descent, i.e.,
                        as heirs. Sprinkle v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 140</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 179 (1952).

                        Heir Rebutted by Ancestor's Warranty. - Where in an action to recover lands the plaintiff claims by paper title to his ancestor, without claim of possession, and it appears that his ancestor has conveyed the land to a stranger with full covenants and
                        warranty of title prior to his having acquired it, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish his title, and he cannot recover, for his ancestor's deed to the stranger, with covenant and warranty, destroys his right of
                        action by rebutter, and passes the title to the grantee by estoppel. Olds v. Richmond Cedar Works, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 161</cite>, 91 S.E. 846 (1917).

                </h3>
                <p>
                    An action may be brought by any person against another who claims an estate or interest in real property adverse to him for the purpose of determining such adverse claims; and by any man or woman against his or her wife or husband or alleged wife or husband
                    who have not lived together as man and wife within the two years preceding, and who at the death of such plaintiff might have or claim to have an interest in his or her estate, and a decree for the plaintiff shall debar all claims
                    of the defendant in the property of the plaintiff then owned or afterwards acquired: Provided, that no such relief shall be granted against such husband or wife or alleged wife or husband, except in case the summons in said action
                    is personally served on such defendant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the defendant in such action disclaim in his answer any interest or estate in the property, or suffer judgment to be taken against him without answer, the plaintiff cannot recover costs. In any case in which judgment has been or shall be docketed,
                    whether such judgment is in favor of or against the person bringing such action, or is claimed by him, or affects real estate claimed by him, or whether such judgment is in favor of or against the person against whom such action may
                    be brought, or is claimed by him, or affects real estate claimed by him, the lien of said judgment shall be such claim of an estate or interest in real estate as is contemplated by this section.

                            Requirements for Prima Facie Case. - In order to establish a prima facie case for removing a cloud on title, a plaintiff must meet two requirements: (1) plaintiff must own the land in controversy, or have some estate or interest in it; and (2) defendant
                            must assert some claim in the land which is adverse to plaintiff's title, estate or interest. Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Wetherington, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 457, 490 S.E.2d 593

                        <p>
                            The section deprives the defendant of no right, but affords him every opportunity of defending the validity of his title; but in the interest of peace and the settlement of controversies, it allows his adversary to put to the test of early judicial investigation,
                            and does not compel plaintiff to wait on the defendant's pleasure as to the time when the inquiry shall be made, and thus give defendant an unfair advantage over him. Carolina-Tennessee Power Co. v. Hiawassee River Power Co.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 668</cite>, 96 S.E. 99 (1918), appeal dismissed, 252 U.S. 341, 40 S. Ct. 330, 64 L. Ed. 601 (1920).

                        <p>
                            The fact that the plaintiff brings his action under this section deprives the defendant of no right. He has the right to defend the validity of his alleged title on every relevant ground available in any type of action involving recovery or possession
                            of real property. Barbee v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 215</cite>, 77 S.E.2d 646 (1953).

                            Record of Exercising Option to Renew Lease Note Necessary. - In a suit to quiet title brought by a lessor, the trial court properly held that lessees had a leasehold interest in a tract through 2011, provided that they continued to tender rent; it was
                            not necessary under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.047.html#t47a02s47-18" target="_blank">G.S. 47-18</a></cite> to record the exercise of an option to renew a lease, and by accepting
                            rent for over 30 years, the lessor and its predecessors had waived the requirement of notice to extend the lease. Spruce Pine Indus. Park, Inc. v. Explosives Supply Co., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 634 S.E.2d
                            264 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 222</cite>, 642 S.E.2d 450 (2007).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The distinction between a suit to remove a cloud upon title and an action to quiet title under this section is clear. In the old equity action, to remove a cloud upon title to real property, the proceeding was an equitable one and was intended to remove
                            a particular instrument or documentary evidence of title or encumbrance against the title, which was hanging over or threatening a plaintiff's rights therein. In a suit to quiet title to real property under this section, the
                            proceeding is designed and intended to provide a means for determining all adverse claims, equitable or otherwise. It is not limited to a particular instrument, bit of evidence, or encumbrance but is aimed at silencing all
                            adverse claims, documentary or otherwise. Any action that could have been brought under the old equitable proceeding to remove a cloud upon title may now be brought under the provisions of this section. York v. Newman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 163 S.E.2d 282 (1968).

                            The General Assembly did not include personal property under the provisions of this section. Newman Mach. Co. v. Newman, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 163 S.E.2d 279 (1968), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 189</cite>,

                        <p>
                            A bill to quiet title or to remove a cloud on title to personal property may be maintained in equity, in the absence of statutory authorization, where, by reason of exceptional circumstances, there is no adequate remedy at law. Newman Mach. Co. v. Newman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 189</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 63 (1969).
                        </p>

                            Even though there is no statute in North Carolina authorizing suits to quiet title to personalty, the Supreme Court adheres to the general rule that such suits may be maintained in equity where, due to exceptional circumstances, there is no adequate remedy
                            at law. Newman Mach. Co. v. Newman, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 189</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 63 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since North Carolina has no statute regarding suits in equity to remove cloud or quiet title to personalty, the Supreme Court applies to such suits the same principles which obtained prior to enactment of this section when title to land was involved.
                            Newman Mach. Co. v. Newman, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 189</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 63 (1969).

                            In order to remove a cloud from a title, it is not necessary to allege and prove that the plaintiff had an estate in or title to the lands in controversy. It is only required that the plaintiff or plaintiffs have such an interest in the lands as to make
                            the claim of the defendants adverse to him or them. Resort Dev. Co. v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 69</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 813 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Burden on Plaintiffs. - In an action to quiet title under this section plaintiffs bear the burden of proving valid title in themselves which may be accomplished by either (1) reliance on the Real Property Marketable Title Act, or (2) utilization of traditional
                            methods of proving title. Chappell v. Donnelly, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 439 S.E.2d 802 (1994).

                            Title Not Necessarily Put in Issue. - By suit to remove a cloud from title, a plaintiff does not necessarily put his title in issue. Resort Dev. Co. v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 69</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 813 (1971).

                            If title becomes involved in a processioning proceeding under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.038.html#t38s38-1" target="_blank">G.S. 38-1</a></cite> through 38-4, the proceeding becomes in effect an action to
                            quiet title under this section. Roberts v. Sawyer, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 279</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 468 (1948); Bumgarner v. Corpening, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 40</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 427 (1957).

                        <p>
                            Where the only issue to be tried is the location of a dividing line, it is a processioning proceeding under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.038.html" target="_blank">Chapter 38</a></cite>. However, where title
                            to the land is put in issue the clerk has no authority to pass on any question involved. He must transfer the proceeding to the regular session of superior court where it becomes in effect an action to quiet title pursuant
                            to this section. Cobb v. Spurlin, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 560, 327 S.E.2d 244 (1985).

                        <p>
                            A declaratory action is an appropriate remedy to perform the function of the customary action to quiet title. York v. Newman, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 163 S.E.2d 282 (1968).

                            Restraining Sale Under Execution. - Under this section the sheriff's sale of land by execution under a judgment may now be restrained by suit in equity when it will cast an additional cloud upon the title of the owner of the lands. Mizell v. Bazemore,
                            <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 324</cite>, 139 S.E. 453 (1927).

                            No statute of limitations runs against plaintiff bringing action for removal of a cloud upon title. Such an action is a continuing right, which exists as long as there is occasion for its exercise. Poore v. Swan Quarter Farms, Inc.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 338 S.E.2d 817 (1986).

                            Theory of Relief May Determine Applicability of Limitations. - There is no express statute of limitations governing actions to quiet title under this section. It thus is necessary to refer to plaintiffs' underlying theory of relief to determine which
                            statute, if any, applies. Poore v. Swan Quarter Farms, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 338 S.E.2d 817 (1986).

                            When Quiet Title Actions Are Treated as Ejectment Actions. - Actions to remove a cloud upon title are in essence ejectment actions and are properly reviewed as such where defendants are in actual possession and plaintiffs seek to recover possession. Poore
                            v. Swan Quarter Farms, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 338 S.E.2d 817 (1986).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Action Held Not One for Ejectment. - Where plaintiffs made no specific allegation that defendants were in actual possession at the time of the filing of their action, and did not seek specifically to recover possession in their demand for relief, but
                            merely prayed for rents and profits and removal of certain deeds as a cloud upon their title, plaintiffs' action was not in essence one for ejectment controlled by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa04s1-38" target="_blank">G.S. 1-38</a></cite>                            and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa04s1-40" target="_blank">G.S. 1-40</a></cite>; rather, plaintiffs' action was one to remove a cloud upon title which was not barred by any statute of limitations.

                            Quitclaim Deeds Conveyed Interest In Land to Corporation. - Trial court erred in granting a homeowners association (HOA) summary judgment, declaring that it was the fee simple owner of a strip of land between a subdivision and the Atlantic Ocean, because
                            the deeds conveying land to the HOA did not include a conveyance of the oceanfront strip; quitclaim deeds conveyed all interest the developer of the subdivision had in the oceanfront strip to the corporation the owners of beachfront

                            knowledge or consent. Quinn v. Quinn, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 777 S.E.2d 121 (2015).

                            Although a deed of trust omitted the amount of a lien, it directed an inquirer to the source of such information by stating that the principal sum was evidenced by a note, which it not only incorporated by reference into the deed of trust, but identified
                            with specificity. Thus, as the deed of trust was valid, summary judgment was granted in favor of the creditor on debtor's cause of action for quiet title under North Carolina law, and debtor's arguments with respect to avoidance
                            of an affidavit of correction pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S.

                            This section was designed and intended to afford a remedy wherever one owns or has an estate or interest in real property, whether he is in or out of possession, and another wrongfully sets up a claim to an estate or interest therein which purports to
                            affect adversely the estate or interest of the true owner and which is reasonably calculated to burden and embarrass such owner in the full and proper enjoyment of his proprietary rights, including the right to dispose of the
                            same at its fair market value. And it should and does extend to such adverse and wrongful claims, whether in writing or parol, whenever a claim by parol, if established, could create an interest or estate in the property, as
                            in case of a parol trust or a lease not required to be in writing. And suit should be allowed, too, when existent records or written instruments reasonably present such a claim, the statute preventing all hardship in such cases
                            by its provision that if the holder does not insist on the same in his answer or does not answer at all, the plaintiff shall pay the costs. Satterwhite v. Gallagher, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 525</cite>,

                            of suspicion, instead of remaining idle and unremunerative. Christman v. Hilliard, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 4</cite>, 82 S.E. 949 (1914); Carolina-Tennessee Power Co. v. Hiawassee River Power

                            The statute has been said to be an extension of the remedy in equity theretofore existing for the removal of clouds on title, and is intended to afford an easy and expeditious mode of determining all conflicting claims to land, whether derived from a
                            common source or from different and independent sources. It is highly remedial and beneficial in its nature, and should therefore be construed liberally. It is also a statute of repose, and for that reason is entitled to favorable
                            consideration. Christman v. Hilliard, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 4</cite>, 82 S.E. 949 (1914); Carolina-Tennessee Power Co. v. Hiawassee River Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 668</cite>,

                            The General Assembly of 1893 enacted the statute now codified as this section to avoid some of the limitations imposed upon the remedies formerly sought by a bill of peace or a bill quia timet, and to establish an easy method of quieting titles to land
                            against adverse claims. Wells v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 102</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 16 (1952).

                            Equitable Estoppel. - Where a loan company sought to quiet title to real property, an equitable estoppel claim did not fail because the attorney who closed the loan did not know and had no way of knowing that the payoff amount included in the letter contained
                            a latent $ 100,000.00 error. Since the attorney's actions were reasonable, the trial court properly concluded that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applied. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Bank One, N.A.,

                            An action must be based upon plaintiffs' ownership of some title, estate, or interest in real property, and defendants' assertion of some claim adverse to plaintiffs' title, estate, or interest, which adverse claim must be presently determinable. Vandiford

                            Plaintiff Need Not Prove Estate in or Title to Land. - The contention that a plaintiff in an action brought under this section must allege and prove that at the commencement of the action and at its trial he had an estate in or title to the land, cannot
                            be sustained. It is only required that he have such an interest in the land that the claim of the defendant is adverse to him. Plotkin v. Merchants' Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 711</cite>,

                            Failure to Prove Prescriptive Easement. - There was inadequate evidence to take the issue of a prescriptive easement to the jury because the defendants had the burden of proving the elements necessary for a prescriptive easement and failed to meet that
                            burden. Nichols v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 448 S.E.2d 119, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 519</cite>, 452 S.E.2d 814 (1994).

                            The statutory action to quiet title to realty consists of two essential elements. The first is that the plaintiff must own the land in controversy, or have some estate or interest in it; and the second is that the defendant must assert some claim to such
                            land adverse to the plaintiff's title, estate or interest. Wells v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 102</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 16 (1952).

                            Remedy Given Whether in or out of Possession. - This section affords the remedy whenever one owns or has an estate or interest in real property, whether he is in or out of possession, and another sets up a claim to an estate or interest therein which
                            purports to affect adversely the estate or interest of the true owner and which is reasonably calculated to burden and embarrass such owner in the full enjoyment or disposition of his property at a fair market value; the statute
                            affords a remedy by disclaimer when the party does not in fact claim the "adverse interest" which is alleged to be a cloud on the title of the true owner. Satterwhite v. Gallagher, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 525</cite>,

                            The authorities to the effect that only one in possession may maintain an action to remove a cloud from title, were decisions rendered prior to the act of 1893, c. 6, Revisal, s. 1589. Since that statute, it is held that the action is maintainable, though
                            plaintiff is not in the present possession or control of the property. Daniels v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 14</cite>, 26 S.E. 635 (1897); Campbell v. Cronly, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 457</cite>,

                            Under this section, the plaintiff is not required to show that he is either in or out of possession. Nor is the plaintiff required to show that the defendant is an occupant or any more than a claimant of the land in controversy. Barbee v. Edwards,

                            Action Is Maintainable Though Plaintiff Might Have Maintained Ejectment. - This section is broad enough to cover an action to quiet the title to real property though the person sued may be wrongfully in possession and the plaintiff might have maintained
                            ejectment. The complaint would not be demurrable merely for the reason that the allegations might be sufficient to support a possessory action. Pressly v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 732</cite>,

                            the execution sale to take place. If the purchaser should delay to commence suit for recovery of possession, then the claimant can commence proceedings under the section. McLean v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 491</cite>,

                            as they are used in this section. This case was decided at September term, 1899. The legislature, at its session in 1903, by chapter 763, amended Laws 1893, c. 6, s. 1, by adding thereto the last sentence of the present section.
                            "Estate" and "interest" now expressly embrace a judgment lien. Crockett v. Bray, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 615</cite>, 66 S.E. 666 (1909).

                            of defense, but to remove a cloud upon the title, under this section. McLamb v. McPhail, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 218</cite>, 35 S.E. 426 (1900).

                            the land to another with full warranty deed, he may continue to prosecute his suit against the mortgagee as to the title, being a real party in interest under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIIa06s1-57" target="_blank">G.S. 1-57</a></cite>,

                            Summary judgment quieting title in the seller of lots in a subdivision was properly granted; the seller had sought to quiet title to a parcel adjacent to the subdivision that was discovered when a new survey revealed that the seller and her husband did
                            not convey all of certain real estate when they sold the subdivision lots, and the seller's title to this parcel was superior to that of the owners of lots in the subdivision, who purported to divide the parcel among themselves.

                            Summary Judgment Quieting Title to County Property Should Have Been Granted. - By the July deed, the property owner conveyed his entire fee simple absolute interest in the property to the county, and the additional language in the deed did not create
                            any limitations or conditions upon the fee simple interest; moreover, municipalities and counties had statutory authority to change the use of real property or to sell or dispose of real property, without regard to the method

                            the trial court should have granted summary judgment to the company as to its action to quiet title, and should have granted summary judgment in favor of the county and the company by way of declaratory judgment pursuant to

                            unclear, and the parties' intent was a question of fact for a jury. Daughtridge v. Tanager Land, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 182</cite>, 835 S.E.2d 411 (2019).

                            An action to quiet title or to remove a cloud from title is equitable in its nature, and may now be maintained to remove from the title a cloud created by the apparent lien of an invalid judgment docketed in the county where the land lies. Holden v. Totten,

                            Judgment Obtained by Fraud. - A complaint alleged, in effect, that the plaintiff had her dower laid off in the lands of her deceased husband, in which the defendant, her son, was properly represented, and thereafter the son, without the service of summons
                            upon her, instituted an independent proceeding to annul the judgment, and falsely represented to her that the action had been withdrawn, and that she should not further consider it, and in consequence, and through his false
                            representation, obtained a judgment in his favor, destroying her dower right. The complaint was held sufficient for the plaintiff to maintain an independent action to set aside the former judgment upon the issue of fraud, and
                            also under this section to remove the former judgment as a cloud upon her title. Stocks v. Stocks, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 285</cite>, 102 S.E. 306 (1920).

                            the tax deed. Galer v. Auburn-Asheville Co., <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 683</cite>, 169 S.E. 642 (1933).

                            of a mortgage executed by the other tenant in common prior to partition, when the mortgagee advertises and seeks to sell a one-half interest in the entire tract, since such foreclosure would constitute a cloud on the purchaser's

                            remove the same, within the intent and meaning of this section, though she is and remains in possession of the land. Satterwhite v. Gallagher, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 525</cite>, 92 S.E. 369

                            on the plaintiff to show the fraud by the preponderance of the evidence, and not by clear, strong and cogent proof as required in the information or correction of a conveyance of land. Ricks v. Brooks,

                            The plaintiff is not bound to show as an independent proposition the invalidity and wrongfulness of the adverse claim. These matters are inseparably interwoven in the two essential elements of the action. The claim of the defendant is necessarily invalid
                            and wrongful if it is adverse to the title, estate or interest of the true owner. Wells v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 102</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 16 (1952).

                            is ordinarily sufficient for the plaintiff to allege and show in general terms that the defendant is asserting some claim adverse to him. Wells v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 102</cite>,

                            Sufficiency of Evidence. - In a quiet title action, plaintiffs' evidence was sufficient to show that the disputed area lay within the boundaries of their land, while defendants' reliance on parol evidence to show that the disputed land belonged to them
                            was improper. Defendants failed to establish that their title was superior to plaintiffs' title. McLennan v. Josey, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 45, 758 S.E.2d 888 (2014).

                            of notice pleading, was minimally sufficient to state a claim for relief under this section. Poore v. Swan Quarter Farms, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 338 S.E.2d 817 (1986).

         Sufficiency of Bill of Complaint.
        </b> - Where a bill asserts that the complainant is the owner of certain designated lands, sets forth the chain of title, and alleges that the defendant claims an adverse interest in the said lands, which claim renders
                            sale impossible and otherwise casts a cloud over complainant's title, it sufficiently states a cause of action to quiet title under this section. North Carolina Mining Co. v. Westfeldt, 151 F. 290 (W.D.N.C. 1907), rev'd on

                            In an action to remove a cloud on title, a complaint alleging that defendants claimed under a receiver's deed and that the trustee in a prior deed of trust executed by the debtor was not a party to the receivership proceedings, is demurrable, since the
                            mere fact that the trustee in the deed of trust was not a party does not in itself render the receiver's deed ineffectual. East Carolina Lumber Co. v. Pamlico County, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 681</cite>,

                            In a suit brought by mortgagors against various defendants alleging various federal and North Carolina state law claims related to a mortgage on their home, a magistrate judge recommended granting the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim filed
                            by defendants as to the mortgagors' quiet title claims because the mortgagors made general allegations that defendants had created defects in the chain of title, but they have not alleged that defendants claimed any adverse
                            interest in the property. Bryant v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., - F. Supp. 2d - (E.D.N.C. Jan. 24, 2012).

                        <p>
                            District court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge with respect to a mortgagor's quiet title claim and dismissed it because the mortgagor did not allege any facts providing a basis for removing the deed of trust as an encumbrance on his
                            property, when it was undisputed that he defaulted on his mortgage loan, and defendants were not asserting any other encumbrance adverse to him, thus, there was no basis for a quiet title claim. Joy v. MERSCORP, Inc., - F.

                            Superior court properly granted the bank's motion to dismiss the purchaser's quiet title claim because the amended complaint failed to sufficiently allege a claim to quiet title; the amended complaint's allegations established that the bank had a valid
                            interest in the property because it alleged that the bank submitted the promissory note secured by the deed of trust, indorsed in blank, to the clerk of court at the foreclosure special proceeding. Greene v. Tr. Servs. of Carolina,
                            LLC, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 781 S.E.2d 664 (2016).

                            Superior court properly granted the bank's motion to dismiss the purchaser's quiet title claim because the amended complaint failed to show that the deed of trust was invalid; the promissory note and the deed of trust were not separated through the securitization
                            process because the transfer of the note constituted an effective assignment of the deed of trust, and the holder of a note could enforce both the note and the deed of trust. Greene v. Tr. Servs. of Carolina, LLC,

                            Unnecessary to Allege Possession. - This section removed the necessity for alleging that the defendant was in possession. The plaintiff may now set out his claim of title, and if defendant disclaims any adverse claim, the plaintiff pays the cost, and
                            the title as between them is settled. Asheville Land Co. v. Lange, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 26</cite>, 63 S.E. 164 (1908).

                            When Occupation Is Alleged. - But where the plaintiff alleges an occupation as the cause of action, not only must the allegation and proof correspond, but the testimony offered to show possession is open to objection and exception on the ground of competency.

                            Admission. - Where the defendants, by answer, admitted that the plaintiff owned an interest in the described lands, but asserted they also had an interest therein, this admission gave the plaintiff standing in court to challenge the defendants' claim
                            as a cloud upon its title. Resort Dev. Co. v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 69</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 813 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Answer Sufficient to Raise Issue. - Where the complaint in a suit to remove a cloud upon plaintiff's title to land alleges that the plaintiff is the owner of the locus in quo, and asks for a reformation of his deed to the lands to show that by mutual
                            mistake the name of the grantee therein was that of a private business enterprise he was conducting, and that accordingly the defendants claimed an interest therein, an allegation in the answer in reply that the defendant had
                            no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to whether the plaintiff was conducting a business in the name of the grantee in the deed is sufficient to raise the issue, and a judgment in plaintiff's favor upon
                            the pleadings is reversible error. Brinson v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 214</cite>, 134 S.E. 453 (1926).

                            Issue as to Delivery of Deed. - Delivery of a deed is essential to its validity, and where the pleadings and evidence raise the question of delivery under this section the court's refusal to submit an issue thereon entitles appellant to a new trial. Ferguson

                            lands in which plaintiffs owned mineral interests in derogation of plaintiffs' right of access, it was held that the damages resulting to plaintiffs from such floodings must be ascertained as in a suit for condemnation. Duke

                            When the defendants alleged their title had its origin in a certain grant, from which they and their predecessors derived title, they thereby assumed the burden of locating the calls of the grant on the ground, and of showing that the grant covered at
                            least a part of the lands described in the complaint. Resort Dev. Co. v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 69</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 813 (1971).

                            Where the defendants claim by record title, and not by adverse possession, and allege their record title had its genesis in a certain grant, the state of the pleadings casts upon them the burden of tracing their title to that grant. Resort Dev. Co. v.

                            Where there is an action pending in the State courts to try the title to lands under this section, the State courts have thereby acquired jurisdiction over the property, and the federal courts will not entertain a suit in equity on the same facts and
                            for the same relief. Westfeldt v. North Carolina Mining Co., 166 F. 706 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 214 U.S. 516, 29 S. Ct. 697, 53 L. Ed. 1064, appeal dismissed, 215 U.S. 586, 30 S. Ct. 404, 54 L. Ed. 339 (1909).

         This section does not enlarge the jurisdiction of federal courts of equity,

                            is in essence an action of ejectment, for the reason that in such action the defendant is entitled under the federal Constitution to a trial by jury. Wood v. Phillips, 50 F.2d 714 (4th Cir. 1931).

                            In an action under this section, while it is true that a federal court of equity lacks jurisdiction of a suit brought against a number of defendants claiming severally different portions of the land in dispute, that ground may oust the court's jurisdiction
                            only in respect to those defendants who raise the objection, and, where title and possession in the complainant is sufficiently alleged, it is error to dismiss the suit as to those defendants who have made no defense, but submitted

                        "Claim of Title to Land" Cannot Be Broadened to Include Claim for Betterments. - Sovereign immunity is a common-law doctrine to which the existing exceptions or waivers have been mandated by the legislature, and statutes which waive the benefits of the

                <p>
                    In all cases where there is a vested interest in real estate, and a contingent remainder over to persons who are not in being, or when the contingency has not yet happened which will determine who the remaindermen are, there may be a sale, lease or mortgage
                    of the property by a special proceeding in the superior court, which proceeding shall be conducted in the manner pointed out in this section. Said proceeding may be commenced by summons by any person having a vested interest in the
                    land, and all persons in esse who are interested in said land shall be made parties defendant and served with summons in the way and manner now provided by law for the service of summons in other special proceedings, as provided by
                    Rule 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, and service of summons upon nonresidents, or persons whose names and residences are unknown, shall be by publication as now required by law or such service in lieu of publication as now provided
                    by law. In cases where the remainder will or may go to minors, or persons under other disabilities, or to persons not in being, or whose names and residences are not known, or who may in any contingency become interested in said land,
                    but because of such contingency cannot be ascertained, the clerk of the superior court shall, after due inquiry of persons who are in no way interested in or connected with such proceeding, designate and appoint some discreet person
                    as guardian ad litem, to represent such remainderman, upon whom summons shall be served as provided by law for other guardians ad litem, and it shall be the duty of such guardian ad litem to defend such actions, and when counsel is
                    needed to represent him, to make this known to the clerk, who shall by an order give instructions as to the employment of counsel and the payment of fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The court shall, if the interest of all parties require or would be materially enhanced by it, order a sale of such property or any part thereof for reinvestment, either in purchasing or in improving real estate, less expense allowed by the court for
                    the proceeding and sale, and such newly acquired or improved real estate shall be held upon the same contingencies and in like manner as was the property ordered to be sold. The court may authorize the loaning of such money subject
                    to its approval until such time when it can be reinvested in real estate. And after the sale of such property in all proceedings hereunder, where there is a life estate, in lieu of said interest or investment of proceeds to which the
                    life tenant would be entitled to, or to the use of, the court may in its discretion order the value of said life tenant's share during the probable life of such life tenant, to be ascertained as now provided by law, and paid out of
                    the proceeds of such sale absolutely, and the remainder of such proceeds be reinvested as herein provided. Any person or persons owning a life estate in lands which are unproductive and from which the income is insufficient to pay
                    the taxes on and reasonable upkeep of said lands shall be entitled to maintain an action, without the joinder of any of the remaindermen or reversioners as parties plaintiff, for the sale of said property for the purpose of obtaining
                    funds for improving other nonproductive and unimproved real estate so as to make the same profit-bearing, all to be done under order of the court, or reinvestment of the funds under the provisions of this section, but in every such
                    action when the rights of minors or other persons not sui juris are involved, a competent and disinterested attorney shall be appointed by the court to file answer and represent their interests. The provisions of the preceding sentence,
                    being remedial, shall apply to cases where any title in such lands shall have been acquired before, as well as after, its passage - March 7, 1927.

                <p>
                    The clerk of the superior court is authorized to make all orders for the sale, lease or mortgage of property under this section, and for the reinvestment or securing and handling of the proceeds of such sales, but no sale under this section shall be held
                    or mortgage given until the same has been approved by the resident judge of the district, or the judge holding the courts of the district at the time said order of sale is made. The approval by the resident judge of the district may

                    The court may authorize the temporary reinvestment, pending final investment in real estate, of funds derived from such sale in any direct obligation of the United States of America or any indirect obligation guaranteed both as to principal and interest
                    or bonds of the State of North Carolina issued since the year 1972; but in the event of such reinvestment, the commissioners, trustees or other officers appointed by the court to hold such funds shall hold the bonds in their possession
                    and shall pay to the life tenant and owner of the vested interest in the lands sold only the interest accruing on the bonds, and the principal of the bonds shall be held subject to final reinvestment and to such expense only as is
                    provided in this section. Temporary reinvestments, as aforesaid, in any direct obligation of the United States of America or any indirect obligation guaranteed both as to principal and interest or State bonds heretofore made with the
                    approval of the court of all or a part of the funds derived from such sales are ratified and declared valid.

                <p>
                    The court shall, if the interest of the parties require it and would be materially enhanced by it, order such property mortgaged for such term and on such condition as to the court seems proper and to the best interest of the interested parties. The proceeds
                    derived from the mortgage shall be used for the purpose of adding improvements to the property or to remove existing liens on the property as the court may direct, but for no other purpose. The mortgagees shall not be held responsible
                    for determining the validity of the liens, debts and expenses where the court directs such liens, debts and expenses to be paid. In all cases of mortgages under this section the court shall authorize and direct the guardian representing
                    the interest of minors and the guardian ad litem representing the interest of those persons unknown or not in being to join in the mortgage for the purpose of conveying the interest of such person or persons. In all cases of mortgages
                    under this section the owner of the vested interest or his or her legal representative shall within six months from the date of the mortgage file with the court an itemized statement showing how the money derived from the said mortgage
                    has been expended, and shall exhibit to the court receipts for said money. Said report shall be audited in the same manner as provided for the auditing of guardian's accounts. The owner of the vested interest or his or her legal representative
                    shall collect the rents and income from the property mortgaged and apply the proceeds first to taxes and discharge of interest on the mortgage and the annual curtailment as provided thereby, or if said person uses or occupies said
                    premises he or she shall pay the said taxes, interest and curtailments and said party shall enter into a bond to be approved by the court for the faithful performance of the duties hereby imposed, and such person shall annually file
                    with the court a report and receipts showing that taxes, interest and the curtailment as provided by the mortgage have been paid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mortgagee shall not be held responsible for the application of the funds secured or derived from the mortgage. The word "mortgage" whenever used herein shall be construed to include deeds in trust.

                            Constitutionality and Validity. - Revisal, s. 1590, now this section, providing for the sale of contingent remainders, is constitutional and valid. Smith v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 620</cite>, 66 S.E. 671 (1909),

                            created by will, though only so far as it is permitted to apply to interests not yet vested. Anderson v. Wilkins, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 154</cite>, 55 S.E. 272 (1906). See Springs v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 548</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The decision in Springs v. Scott was approved in Hodges v. Lipscomb, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 199</cite>, 45 S.E. 556 (1903), a case in which it appeared that the will was made prior to the passage of Laws 1903, c. 99.
                            It was there held that the act of 1903 operated retrospectively, so as to apply to contingent interest created by a will which had already taken effect by the death of the testator. Anderson v. Wilkins, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 154</cite>,

                            Purpose of Section. - To prevent any possible doubt of the existence of the power of the court, upon the application of all the parties in interest, the trustee representing contingent remaindermen, and to provide for its exercise and protect the interest
                            of all parties in remainder, whether in esse or not, the act of 1903, now this section, was passed. McAfee v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 411</cite>, 55 S.E. 828 (1906).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of this section is not to obtain predictive declarations of future rights of the parties, inter se, but rather to promote the interest of all the parties by allowing the sale of desirable land free from restrictions imposed by the presence
                            of uncertainties as to whom the land will ultimately belong. Crumpton v. Crumpton, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 651</cite>, 227 S.E.2d 587 (1976).

                        <p>
                            The remedial purpose of this section may be served where there are contingent remainders over to persons not in being, or the contingency has not happened which will determine who the ultimate remaindermen are, but to achieve the desired result the provisions
                            of the statute must be observed. Barnes v. Dortch, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 369</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 872 (1957).

                            Section Does Not Destroy Interest of Remote Contingent Remaindermen. - It will be noted that this section does not, either in its terms or purpose, profess or undertake to destroy the interest of the contingent remaindermen in the property, but only contemplates
                            and provides for a change of investment, and, subject to the right to use a reasonable portion of the amount for the improvement of the remainder, when properly safeguarded, it impresses upon the fund the same contingencies
                            and limitations as were imposed upon the original property. Dawson v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 158</cite>, 98 S.E. 459 (1919).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was not the purpose of this section to destroy the interest of the remote contingent remaindermen, but to enable the present owners to sell the property and make a good title to the same, and to require that the proceeds be held as a fund, subject
                            to the claims of persons who may ultimately be entitled thereto, and safeguard their rights in all respects. Poole v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 588</cite>, 112 S.E. 323 (1922). See
                            Lancaster v. Lancaster, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 673</cite>, 184 S.E. 527 (1936).

                        <p>
                            When Section Applicable. - This section (before the 1927 amendment) and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a01s41-12" target="_self">G.S. 41-12</a></cite> apply only to a sale of property in which there are or have been contingent
                            interests. Waddell v. United Cigar Stores, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 434</cite>, 142 S.E. 585 (1928).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1927 amendment, where the land is unproductive, etc., extends the right of action to include life estates where there are vested remaindermen and reversioners without their joinder. The section theretofore had reference only to contingent remainders.
                            Stepp v. Stepp, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 237</cite>, 156 S.E. 804, 76 A.L.R. 536 (1931).

                        <p>
                            A sale under this section can be ordered only in a "special proceeding," which must be instituted before the clerk of the superior court, and the section has no application to an action for waste under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sXIVa42s1-533" target="_blank">G.S. 1-533</a></cite>.

                            Strict Compliance Required. - In order that a valid conveyance of the land in fee simple be made pursuant to this section, it is essential that the provisions of the statute be strictly complied with. Blades v. Spitzer,
                            <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 207</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 315 (1960).

                        <p>
                            Applied to Charitable and Other Trusts. - Courts, in the exercise of general equitable jurisdiction, may, in proper instances, decree a sale of estate in remainder and affected by contingent interests, for reinvestment, or a portion thereof, when it is
                            shown that it is necessary for the preservation of the estate and the protection of its owners; and this principle is not infrequently applied in the proper administration of charitable and other trusts, notwithstanding limitations
                            in instruments creating them that apparently impose restrictions on the powers of the trustee in this respect, when it is properly established that the sale is required by the necessities of the case and the successful carrying
                            out of the dominant purposes of the trust. Middleton v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 437</cite>, 102 S.E. 780 (1920).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sale of an estate in remainder affected under the terms of a will with certain ultimate and contingent interests in trust will not be affected by a clause in the will requiring that the principal of the trust fund shall not be used or diminished during
                            the period of 30 years, with a certain exception, the limitation applying only to the administration of the trust estate, and not preventing the court from ordering a sale when required by the necessities of the estate for
                            its preservation. Middleton v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 437</cite>, 102 S.E. 780 (1920).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Section Does Not Limit Power of Court over Trusts. - This section, authorizing those who have a vested interest in land with contingent remainders over to persons not in being to petition for and procure the sale of the land for reinvestment, does not
                            limit the power of the court to supervise the administration of trust estates and to enter such orders and decrees in respect thereto as circumstances may require, so that the interest of contingent remaindermen and other beneficial
                            owners may be sold to preserve the trust estate from destruction. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Rasberry, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 586</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 601 (1946).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Power of Court Independent of Section. - The court, without regard to the Act of 1903, now this section, has the power to order the sale of real estate limited to a tenant for life, with remainder to children or issue, and upon failure thereof, over to
                            persons, all or some of whom are not in esse, when one of the class being first in remainder after the expiration of the life estate is in esse and a party to the proceeding to represent the class, and upon decree passed, and
                            sale and title made pursuant thereto, the purchaser acquires a perfect title as against all persons in esse or in posse. Springs v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 548</cite>, 44 S.E. 116 (1903).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the courts of this State do not have inherent power to decree a sale and pass title to the purchaser of lands, with remainder limited upon a contingency that would prevent the ascertainment of the ultimate takers, or any of them, till the death
                            of the life tenant, this power is now conferred by the express terms of our statute in all cases where there is a vested interest in real estate, with a contingent interest over to persons not in being, or when the contingency
                            has not happened which shall determine who the remaindermen are, under the procedure therein laid down. Dawson v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 158</cite>, 98 S.E. 459 (1919).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Decree May Be Binding on Persons Not in Esse. - A lease authorized by the decree of a court of chancery may be binding upon beneficiaries not in esse, when their interests are the same as those of persons in being who are subjected by due process to the
                            jurisdiction of the court. Waddell v. United Cigar Stores, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 434</cite>, 142 S.E. 585 (1928), wherein a lease of trust property was held valid over the objection that
                            it might extend beyond the term of the trust.

                            Status of Remainders. - Contingent remainders are no longer considered mere possibilities which cannot be transferred, but a remainderman whose estate is contingent may convey it. 2 N.C.L. Rev. 126; Beacon v. Amos, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 357</cite>,

                            that the best interest of all parties so requires, and those living and in present interest are represented in person, and unborn children by guardian ad litem. McLean v. Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 424</cite>,

                            Plaintiff Must Have Vested Interest. - In a proceeding under this section to sell real property in which there is a contingent interest, plaintiff must be a person having a vested interest in the property to be sold, and the sale must be passed upon by
                            the judgment of the superior court. The contingent interest alone cannot be sold. Butler v. Winston, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 421</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 124 (1943).

                            Where one who had no vested estate in land brought action in the superior court against contingent remaindermen to sell land, the court lacked jurisdiction of the action, and hence the judgment ordering sale of the land was void and could be collaterally

                            In proceedings under this section certain contingent interests in land held in trust were sold and reinvested in other lands in accordance with the terms of the trust in the original deed conveying them. The title acquired under the original deed in trust
                            by the trustee had become passive in him, and it was held that as, under the statute of uses, the legal and equitable title had merged in the same person, neither the trustee nor his heirs were necessary parties to the owner's
                            action against a purchaser to enforce his contract of purchase, and especially so when all vested and contingent interests were represented by some of the parties to the suit. Lee v. Oates,

                            who, on the happening of the contingency, would presently have an estate in the property at the time of action commenced, and as to others more remotely interested they could have their interest represented and protected by
                            the guardian ad litem as the statute provides. Dawson v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 158</cite>, 98 S.E. 459 (1919).

                            would presently have an estate in the property at the time the proceeding is commenced, made parties and served with summons. Barnes v. Dortch, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 369</cite>, 95 S.E.2d

                            Effect of Omission of Persons Having Contingent Interests. - An order of sale and judgment of confirmation will not be vacated on the ground that certain contingent remaindermen were not made parties to the proceedings to sell, where the interest of the
                            contingent remaindermen has, since the sale, been extinguished by failure of the contingency. Beam v. Gilkey, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 520</cite>, 35 S.E.2d 641 (1945).

                            Setting Aside Sale for Failure to Serve Summons on Infant. - Where in proceedings to sell lands affected with contingent interests the provisions of this section have been observed, and the clerk has appointed a guardian ad litem for contingent interests
                            and for infant parties, the failure to serve summons on a minor is to be regarded as an irregularity that will not render the sale void and a nullity. However, on a proper showing, the sale may be set aside as to all the parties
                            except an innocent purchaser without notice of the irregularity; and on appeal to the Supreme Court, when this fact is not apparent, the case will be remanded for its ascertainment. Welch v. Welch,

                            guardian's appointment was void. Butler v. Winston, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 421</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 124 (1943).

                            When Action Abates. - An action against a contingent remainderman to sell the lands under this section abates upon the death of the remainderman prior to the termination of the life estate, when his limitation over is made to depend upon his surviving
                            the life tenant. Redden v. Toms, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 312</cite>, 190 S.E. 490 (1937).

                            Estoppel by Judgment. - Where an executor under a will with power to sell the lands of his testate and reinvest the proceeds, etc., has died, and all persons in present and contingent interest have been made parties to an action wherein the court has
                            substituted another as trustee, upon like trusts in every respect, and the decree was not appealed from, all the privies and parties are estopped as to all issuable matters therein, and may not deny the power of the substituted
                            trustee to make sale of the lands as fully as the executor under the will was therein authorized to make. Hayden v. Hayden, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 259</cite>, 100 S.E. 515 (1919).

                            Preliminary Judgment for Payment of Betterments. - Where a preliminary judgment in proceedings to sell lands with contingent interests provides for the payment of betterments to the life tenant, and in this respect the judgment is not excepted to or appealed
                            from, it is conclusive upon the parties as an estoppel. Pendleton v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 248</cite>, 95 S.E. 500 (1918).

                            unite in the decree, cannot estop the parties to proceedings thereafter brought under the provisions of this section. Pendleton v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 248</cite>, 95 S.E. 500

                            Sale of Lands with Contingent Interests. - The court has the power to order the private sale of lands affected with contingent interests under the provisions of this section under a proper finding that it would be to the best interests of all concerned,
                            without submitting this issue to the jury, and where the proceedings are properly had and all parties are before the court, the objection is untenable that the sale was made under the decision of the court, and the parties
                            had not agreed thereto. DeLaney v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 282</cite>, 145 S.E. 398 (1928). See Ryder v. Oates, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 569</cite>, 92 S.E. 508 (1917).

                            Bond Required. - Where the court decrees a sale of trust property for reinvestment, the trustees should be required to give bond, or other legal provision should be made, to assure the safety of the funds arising from the sale, notwithstanding that the
                            will provides that the trustees should not be required to give bond in administering the trust, since in acting under the decree of the court the trustees act as commissioners of the court and not necessarily as trustees under
                            the will. Blades v. Spitzer, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 207</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 315 (1960).

                            Decree Must Provide for Reinvestment. - Where real estate is sold under order of the court, the decree must provide for investment of the fund in such way as the court may deem best for the protection of all persons who have or may have remote or contingent
                            interests. Springs v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 548</cite>, 44 S.E. 116 (1903).

                            Discretion of Court and Clerk in Reinvestment. - Before the 1923 amendment, which inserted the first sentence of the third paragraph of this section, it was held that the preservation of the proceeds of the sale of lands, under this section, was referred
                            to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and no error was found to an order requiring the funds to be paid into the office of the clerk of the superior court, to be loaned out by him or otherwise invested as required by
                            law until the happening of the contingency, except that it should be so modified as to require that interest on these loans be allowed the owners of the particular estate, it appearing that they were given the usufruct of the
                            land. Pendleton v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 248</cite>, 95 S.E. 500 (1918).

                        <p>
                            Time of Reinvestment. - In Laws 1905, c. 548, the reinvestment in realty was required to be within two years, but such requirement was removed by the later Laws 1907, cc. 956 and 980, leaving the matter of reinvestment somewhat in the discretion of the
                            court, but with clear intimation that the fund should be reinvested in realty when an advantageous opportunity should be offered. Dawson v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 158</cite>, 98 S.E.

                            Effect of Omitting Bond Required by G.S. 1-407. - In all cases where property affected with unascertainable contingent remainders is ordered sold under the provisions of this section, it is now required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sXIIa33s1-407" target="_blank">G.S. 1-407</a></cite>                            that a bond be given to assure the safety of the funds arising from the sale; but where this is omitted from a judgment otherwise regular, it will not affect the title conveyed, though the decree should be modified in that
                            respect by proper steps taken in the superior court. Poole v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 588</cite>, 112 S.E. 323 (1922).

                            Where an order has been made for the sale of timber growing upon lands affected with contingent interests, the court should also require its commissioner appointed for the sale to give bond for the preservation and proper application of the proceeds of
                            sale, etc., under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sXIIa33s1-407" target="_blank">G.S. 1-407</a></cite>; but this provision does not affect the title of the purchaser, who
                            is not required to see to the application of the funds, and the proper order in this respect may be supplied by amendment or supplementary decree. Midyette v. Lycoming Timber &amp; Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 423</cite>,

                            Purchaser's Liability Ends When Money Paid into Court. - A purchaser of devised lands affected with a life estate and contingent limitation over, sold for reinvestment under the provisions of this section, is not ordinarily charged with the duty of looking
                            after the proper disposition of the purchase money, and upon paying it into court, under its order, he is quit of further obligation concerning it. McLean v. Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 424</cite>,

                            Where the purchaser at a sale of lands for reinvestment pays his money into the court or to the person authorized by order of court to receive it, ordinarily he is not required to see to the proper application of the fund, its safety being taken care
                            of by the court in its final decree. DeLaney v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 282</cite>, 145 S.E. 398 (1928).

                            Purchaser Takes Fee Simple Title. - A purchaser at a sale of land with contingent interests allowed under the provisions of this section acquires a fee simple title, upon payment of purchase price to the court or person authorized to receive it, without
                            being required to see to the application of the funds, and on such payment made is quit of all obligations concerning it. Pendleton v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 248</cite>, 95 S.E.

                            Commissioner Held Without Authority to Insert Restrictions in Deed. - Where a commissioner was authorized by the court to sell part of the lands of an estate for reinvestment under the provisions of this section, and there were no restrictions in regard
                            to the use of the property of the estate, and in the commissioner's report and recommendation of the offer to purchase, no authority to restrict the use of the property was asked, and none granted in the order of the court,
                            it was held that the commissioner was without authority to insert restrictions in the deed to the purchaser, his authority being limited under the order of the court to the sale of the property and the distribution of the proceeds
                            of sale. Southern Real Estate Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Atlantic Ref. Co., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 501</cite>, 181 S.E. 633 (1935).

                            Where lands are affected with a contingent interest in remainder, not determinable during the life of the tenant for life, the holder of the vested interest and those in immediate remainder may proceed to have the lands sold under the provisions of this
                            section, and have those remotely interested represented by guardian ad litem for the protection of their interests; and where it is made to appear that the interest of all parties requires, or will be materially enhanced by
                            it, the court may order a sale of the property, or any part thereof, for reinvestment, either in purchasing or improving real estate, etc., or invested temporarily to be held under the same contingencies in like manner as the

                            Complaints Held Good on Demurrer. - A testator devised his improved and unimproved lands, in the corporate limits of a town, to his daughter for life with remainder to her children living at her death, with ulterior limitations over to trustees on certain
                            contingencies, and the life tenant brought proceedings for sale and reinvestment of the proceeds under the provisions of this section, having made parties of the persons interested in accordance with the statute, and alleged
                            that by the sale the income would be largely increased, that the sale of the contemplated part to a purchaser she had secured for a certain price would enable her to make improvements on the land then without income, to make
                            houses on other parts of the land more profitable for rental purposes, etc., that the property as it stood was rapidly depreciating, and that there were no available funds, otherwise, to meet the necessary and insistent demands.
                            It was held that a demurrer was bad, and properly overruled. Middleton v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 437</cite>, 102 S.E. 780 (1920).

                            is improperly sustained, the complaint alleging at least one good cause for action. Stepp v. Stepp, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 237</cite>, 156 S.E. 804 (1931).

                            provisions of this section, and in these proceedings have protected the interest of the remote remaindermen by the appointment for them of a guardian ad litem, and have fully set forth the facts and circumstances of the former
                            sale, and bring in the proceeds and submit them to the jurisdiction and orders of the court, the final judgment authorizing and confirming the sale, being had in conformity with the provisions of the statute, perfects the title,

                            Testator devised land to his five brothers and sisters and a nephew "for their lives and then to their children." The life tenants partitioned the land into equal shares, and the lot partitioned to a surviving brother, aged 75 without children, was conveyed
                            by the children of the four deceased life tenants and the other surviving life tenant and her children to the wife of the surviving brother. The petitioners who purchased the lot from the surviving brother and his wife were
                            not entitled to sell it by virtue of a proceeding under this section where the heirs of the testator living at the time of the proceeding were not made parties, since upon the death of the brother without issue the land would
                            revert to the heirs of the testator living at that time. Barnes v. Dortch, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 369</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 872 (1957).

                            A will devised a life estate to daughter with remainder to her children but she renounced her life estate and it was adjudicated that the renunciation of the life estate accelerated the vesting of title in members of the class in esse at the time. It
                            was held that the acceleration of the estate of the remaindermen did not change the date when the final roll call will be made to ascertain members of the class, and although members of the class in esse are not required to
                            account for rents and profits pending the birth of other members of the class, after-born children must be let in, and the fee simple title to the land cannot be conveyed prior to the death of the life tenant except for reinvestment

                            deceased child of the life tenant should take such child's share, requires that the remaindermen be ascertained upon the falling in of the life estate, who then take under the will and not as heirs of the life tenant, so that
                            this section is applicable. Blades v. Spitzer, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 207</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 315 (1960).

                            upon default, it was held that in an action to foreclose the lien for taxes against the land under former G.S. 105-414, in which the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, the life tenant and the known contingent remaindermen were
                            made parties, and the minor contingent remaindermen, the unknown contingent remaindermen and those not in esse were represented by guardian ad litem under this section, and the provisions of both statutes were fully and accurately
                            followed, the purchaser at the commissioner's sale acquired the fee simple title. Rodman v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 320</cite>, 20 S.E.2d 294 (1942).

                            Sale of Growing Timber. - The timber growing upon lands devised to the testator's named daughter for her sole and separate use during her life only, and at her death to such of her children and grandchildren then living as she may have appointed in her
                            will, and upon her failure to have done so, to her children and grandchildren then living, during the life of the daughter, was affected by the contingencies contemplated by this section. Midyette v. Lycoming Timber &amp; Lumber

                            Order of Sale Held Invalid. - The proceeding in which an order for the sale of a lot was made was not instituted and was not conducted in accordance with this section. The power of sale was not exercised by virtue of the statute. The proceeding was brought
                            before the clerk, and not in term. The minors were not represented by guardian ad litem appointed by the judge, but by a next friend appointed by the clerk. The order of sale was signed, not during the term (now session) of
                            the superior court in Haywood County, but by the judge holding the courts of the twentieth district (which includes Haywood County), at Sylva, in Jackson County, in said district. The order of sale could not, therefore, be
                            held valid. Lide v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 37</cite>, 128 S.E. 477 (1925).

                            Effect of Invalid Decree for Sale and Reinvestment. - In an action brought under the provisions of this section, to sell certain lands devised to E for life with a contingent remainder to her children, it appeared that to further a scheme to erect a hotel
                            on one of the lots, the court had decreed the sale of certain other of the lands and had appointed a commissioner to act in furtherance of its object. The lands were sold and the proceeds applied to the building of the hotel,
                            but the funds being only sufficient to erect the skeleton work of the hotel, other of the lands were decreed by the court to be sold, and their proceeds to be likewise applied; these would not be sufficient for the purpose,
                            and when erected the hotel would not be a desirable investment, especially in the unfurnished condition in which it then would be left. It was held: (1) That the decree for the further sale and reinvestment was void, not meeting
                            the statutory requirement that the interests involved should be properly safeguarded; (2) that the court was without authority to order an investment or reinvestment of funds not then available, but depending upon the outcome
                            of future sales of the land, and of this, notice was implied to third persons; (3) that the purchasers at the sale of the land derived to a clear title thereto; (4) that the commissioner came under no personal liability to
                            the contractor or materialmen of the hotel building; (5) that endorsers of a note made to procure money for building the hotel had no claim on the hotel lot; (6) that the commissioner should sell the hotel lot and report to
                            the court, and that the proceeds be held for the benefit of the devisees to the extent of the value of the lots and the costs of improvements thereon free from the claims of materialmen, etc. Smith v. Miller,

                            Mortgage for Permanent Improvements Held Improper. - The locus in quo was devised to testator's daughter for life with limitation over to the daughter's children. The daughter and her husband expended large sums in making permanent improvements upon the
                            property, and instituted this proceeding against their children, in esse or which might thereafter be born, seeking to have a mortgage in the sum of $20,900 placed on the property to refinance an existing mortgage on the property
                            in the sum of $10,000, and also unsecured notes executed by the life tenant representing a part of the moneys used in making said improvements. It was held that since the remaindermen were in no way liable for any sums expended
                            by the life tenant in making permanent improvements, the finding by the court that the execution of the mortgage to refinance the indebtedness would materially enhance the interest of the remaindermen was erroneous, and judgment
                            directing the execution of the mortgage to refinance the indebtedness should be reversed. Hall v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 805</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 273 (1941).

                        Application. - A testator devised certain lands to his wife during her widowhood or life, which, at her death, were to be equally divided between the children or "their heirs." The lands were sold in partition in 1904, during the lifetime of the widow,
                        and the children were made parties. One of these children died in 1906, before the death of her mother (1909) and her children, the grandchildren of the testator, brought suit to recover their interests in the land devised, claiming
                        they had a vested interest therein in 1904, and not being parties to the proceedings, were not estopped by the judgment in partition. It was held that the plaintiffs had a contingent interest in the lands at the time of the sale,
                        and were precluded from claiming the lands under the Validating Act of 1905 (Revisal, s. 1591, now this section). Bullock v. Planters Cotton-Seed Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 63</cite>, 80 S.E.

         The Common-law Rule's Validating and Invalidating Sides
        </i> . The Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is a rule of
                            <i>
         initial
        </i> validity or invalidity. At common law, a nonvested property interest is either valid or invalid
                            <i>
         as of its creation
        </i> . Like most rules of property law, the Common-law Rule has both a validating and an invalidating side. Both sides are derived from John Chipman Gray's formulation of the Common-law Rule:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No [nonvested property] interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            J. Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities

         §
        </span> 201 (4th ed. 1942). From this formulation, the validating and invalidating sides of the Common-law Rule are derived as follows:

                        <p>
                            <i>
         Validating Side of the Common-law Rule
        </i> . A nonvested property interest is valid when it is created (initially valid) if it is then
                            <i>
         certain
        </i> to vest or terminate (fail to vest) - one or the other - no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then alive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>
         Invalidating Side of the Common-law Rule
        </i> . A nonvested property interest is invalid when it is created (initially invalid) if there is no such certainty.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Notice that the invalidating side focuses on a lack of
                            <i>
         certainty
        </i> , which means that invalidity under the Common-law Rule is
                            <i>
         not
        </i> dependent on
                            <i>
         actual
        </i> post-creation events but only on
                            <i>
         possible
        </i> post-creation events.
                            <i>
         Actual
        </i> post-creation events are irrelevant, even those that are known at the time of the lawsuit. It is generally recognized that the
                            <i>
         invalidating
        </i> side of the Common-law Rule is harsh because it can invalidate interests on the ground of possible post-creation events that are extremely unlikely to happen and that in actuality almost never do happen, if ever.

                            <i>
         The Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities
        </i> . The essential difference between the Common-law Rule and its statutory replacement is that the Statutory Rule preserves the Common-law Rule's overall policy of preventing property from being tied up in unreasonably
                            long or even perpetual family trusts or other property arrangements, while eliminating the harsh potential of the Common-law Rule. The Statutory Rule achieves this result by codifying (in slightly revised form) the validating
                            side of the Common-law Rule and modifying the invalidating side by adopting a wait-and-see element. Under the Statutory Rule, interests that would have been initially valid at common law continue to be initially valid, but
                            interests that would have been initially invalid at common law are invalid only if they do not actually vest or terminate within the permissible vesting period set forth in Section 1(a)(2). Thus, the Uniform Act recasts the
                            validating and invalidating sides of the Rule Against Perpetuities as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>
         Validating Side of the Statutory Rule
        </i> : A nonvested property interest is initially valid if, when it is created, it is then
                            <i>
         certain
        </i> to vest or terminate (fail to vest) - one or the other - no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then alive. The validity of a nonvested property interest that is not
                            <i>
         initially
        </i> valid is in abeyance. Such an interest is valid if it vests within the permissible vesting period after its creation.
                        </p>

                            <i>
         Invalidating Side of the Statutory Rule
        </i> : A nonvested property interest that is not
                            <i>
         initially
        </i> valid becomes invalid (and subject to reformation under Section 3) if it neither vests nor terminates within the permissible vesting period after its creation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As indicated, this modification of the invalidating side of the Common-law Rule is generally known as the wait-and-see method of perpetuity reform. The wait-and-see method of perpetuity reform was approved by the American Law Institute as part of the
                            Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)

                            <i>
         Nonvested Property Interest
        </i> . Section 1(a) sets forth the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities with respect to nonvested property interests. A nonvested property interest (also called a contingent property interest) is a future interest in
                            property that is subject to an unsatisfied condition precedent. In the case of a class gift, the interests of all the unborn members of the class are nonvested because they are subject to the unsatisfied condition precedent
                            of being born. At common law, the interests of all potential class members must be valid or the class gift is invalid. As pointed out in more detail later in this Comment, this so-called all-or-nothing rule with respect to
                            class gifts is not superseded by this Act, and so remains in effect under the Statutory Rule. Consequently, all class gifts that are subject to open are to be regarded as nonvested property interests for the purposes of this
                            Act.

                            <i>
         Section 1(a)(1) Codifies the Validating Side of the Common-law Rule
        </i> . The validating side of the Common-law Rule is codified in Section 1(a)(1) (and, with respect to powers of appointment, in Sections 1(b)(1) and 1(c)(1)).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A nonvested property interest that satisfies the requirement of Section 1(a)(1) is initially valid. That is, it is valid as of the time of its creation. There is no need to subject such an interest to the waiting period set forth in Section 1(a)(2), nor
                            would it be desirable to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For a nonvested property interest to be valid as of the time of its creation under Section 1(a)(1), there must then be a
                            <i>
         certainty
        </i> that the interest will either vest or terminate - an interest terminates when vesting becomes impossible - no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then alive. To satisfy this requirement, it must
                            be established that there is no possible chain of events that might arise after the interest was created that would allow the interest to vest or terminate after the expiration of the 21-year period following the death of an
                            individual in being at the creation of the interest. Consequently, initial validity under Section 1(a)(1) can be established only if there is an individual for whom there is a causal connection between the individual's death
                            and the interest's vesting or terminating no later than 21 years thereafter.
                            <i>
         The individual described in subsection (a)(1) (and subsections (b)(1) and (c)(1) as well) is often referred to as the "validating life," the term used throughout the Comments to this Act.

                            <i>
         Determining Whether There is a Validating Life
        </i> . The process for determining whether a validating life exists is to postulate the death of each individual connected in some way to the transaction, and ask the question: Is there with respect to this individual
                            an invalidating chain of possible events? If one individual can be found for whom the answer is No, that individual can serve as the validating life. As to that individual there will be the requisite causal connection between
                            his or her death and the questioned interest's vesting or terminating no later than 21 years thereafter.

                        <p>
                            In searching for a validating life, only individuals who are connected in some way to the transaction need to be considered, for they are the only ones who have a chance of supplying the requisite causal connection. Such individuals vary from situation
                            to situation, but typically include the beneficiaries of the disposition, including the taker or takers of the nonvested property interest, and individuals related to them by blood or adoption, especially in the ascending and
                            descending lines. There is no point in even considering the life of an individual unconnected to the transaction - an individual from the world at large who happens to be in being at the creation of the interest. No such individual
                            can be a validating life because there will be an invalidating chain of possible events as to every unconnected individual who might be proposed: Any such individual can immediately die after the creation of the nonvested property
                            interest without causing any acceleration of the interest's vesting or termination. (The life expectancy of any unconnected individual, or even the probability that one of a number of new-born babies will live a long life,
                            is irrelevant.)

         Example (1) - Parent of Devisees as the Validating Life
        </i> . G devised property "to A for life, remainder to A's children who attain 21." G was survived by his son (A), by his daughter (B), by A's wife (W), and by A's two children (X and Y).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The nonvested property interest in favor of A's children who reach 21 satisfies Section 1(a)(1)'s requirement, and the interest is initially valid. When the interest was created (at G's death), the interest was then certain to vest or terminate no later
                            than 21 years after A's death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The process by which A is determined to be the validating life is one of testing various candidates to see if any of them have the requisite causal connection. As noted above, no one from the world at large can have the requisite causal connection, and
                            so such individuals are disregarded. Once the inquiry is narrowed to the appropriate candidates, the first possible validating life that comes to mind is A, who does in fact fulfill the requirement: Since A's death cuts off
                            the possibility of any more children being born to him, it is impossible, no matter when A dies, for any of A's children to be alive and under the age of 21 beyond 21 years after A's death. (See the discussion of subsection
                            (d), below.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A is therefore the validating life for the nonvested property interest in favor of A's children who attain 21. None of the other individuals who is connected to this transaction could serve as the validating life because an invalidating chain of possible
                            post-creation events exists as to each one of them. The other individuals who might be considered include W, X, Y, and B. In the case of W, an invalidating chain of events is that she might predecease A, A might remarry and
                            have a child by his new wife, and such child might be alive and under the age of 21 beyond the 21-year period following W's death. With respect to X and Y, an invalidating chain of events is that they might predecease A, A
                            might later have another child, and that child might be alive and under 21 beyond the 21-year period following the death of the survivor of X and Y. As to B, she suffers from the same invalidating chain of events as exists
                            with respect to X and Y. The fact that none of these other individuals can serve as the validating life is of no consequence, however, because only one such individual is required for the validity of a nonvested interest to
                            be established, and that individual is A.

         The Rule of Subsection (d)
        </i> . The rule established in subsection (d) plays a significant role in the search for a validating life. Subsection (d) declares that the possibility that a child will be born to an individual after the individual's
                            death is to be disregarded. It is important to note that this rule applies only for the purposes of determining the validity of an interest (or power of appointment) under paragraph (1) of subsection (a), (b), or (c). The rule
                            of subsection (d) does not apply, for example, to questions such as whether or not a child who is born to an individual after the individual's death qualifies as a taker of a beneficial interest - as a member of a class or
                            otherwise. Neither subsection (d), nor any other provision of this Act, supersedes the widely accepted common-law principle, sometimes codified, that a child in gestation (a child sometimes described as a child
                            <i>
         en ventre sa mere
        </i> ) who is later born alive is regarded as alive at the commencement of gestation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The limited purpose of subsection (d) is to solve a perpetuity problem caused by advances in medical science. The problem is illustrated by a case such as Example (1), above - "to A for life, remainder to A's children who reach 21." When the Common-law
                            Rule was developing, the possibility was recognized, strictly speaking, that one or more of A's children might reach 21 more than 21 years after A's death. The possibility existed because A's wife (who might not be a life in
                            being) might be pregnant when A died. If she was, and if the child was born viable a few months after A's death, the child could not reach his or her 21st birthday within 21 years after A's death. The device then invented to
                            validate the interest of A's children was to "extend" the allowable perpetuity period by tacking on a period of gestation, if needed. As a result, the common-law perpetuity period was comprised of three components: (1) a life
                            in being (2) plus 21 years (3) plus a period of gestation, when needed. Today, thanks to sperm banks, frozen embryos, and even the possibility of artificially maintaining the body functions of deceased pregnant women long enough
                            to develop the fetus to viability (see Detroit Free Press, July 31, 1986, at 5A; Ann Arbor News, Oct. 30, 1978, at C5 (AP story); N.Y. Times, Dec. 6, 1977, at 30; N.Y. Times, Dec. 2, 1977, at B16) - advances in medical science
                            unanticipated when the Common-law Rule was in its developmental stages - having a pregnant wife at death is no longer the only way of having children after death. These medical developments, and undoubtedly others to come,
                            make the mere addition of a period of gestation inadequate as a device to confer initial validity under Section 1(a)(1) on the interest of A's children in the above example. The rule of subsection (d), however,
                            <i>
         does
        </i> insure the initial validity of the children's interest. Disregarding the possibility that children of A will be born after his death allows A to be the validating life. None of his children, under this assumption,
                            can reach 21 more than 21 years after his death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that subsection (d) subsumes not only the case of children conceived after death, but also the more conventional case of children in gestation at death. With subsection (d) in place, the third component of the common-law perpetuity period is unnecessary
                            and has been jettisoned. The perpetuity period recognized in paragraph (1) of subsections (a), (b), and (c) has only two components: (1) a life in being (2) plus 21 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As to the legal status of conceived-after-death children, that question has not yet been resolved. For example, if in Example (1) it in fact turns out that A does leave sperm on deposit at a sperm bank and if in fact A's wife does become pregnant as a
                            result of artificial insemination, the child or children produced thereby might not be included at all in the class gift. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers) Introductory Note to Ch. 26 at pp. 2-3 (Tent.
                            Draft No. 9, 1986). Without trying to predict how that matter will be settled in the future, the best way to handle the problem from the perpetuity perspective is subsection (d)'s rule requiring the possibility of post-death
                            children to be disregarded.

         Recipients as Their Own Validating Lives
        </i> . It is well established at common law that, in appropriate cases, the recipient of an interest can be his or her own validating life. See, e.g., Rand v. Bank of California, 236 Or. 619, 388 P.2d 437 (1964). Given
                            the right circumstances, this principle can validate interests that are contingent on the recipient's reaching an age in excess of 21, or are contingent on the recipient's surviving a particular point in time that is or might
                            turn out to be in excess of 21 years after the interest was created or after the death of a person in being at the date of creation.

         Example (2) - Devisees as Their Own Validating Lives
        </i> . G devised real property "to A's children who attain 25." A predeceased G. At G's death, A had three living children, all of whom were under 25.

                        <p>
                            The nonvested property interest in favor of A's children who attain 25 is validated by Section 1(a)(1). Under subsection (d), the possibility that A will have a child born to him after his death (and since A predeceased G, after G's death) must be disregarded.
                            Consequently, even if A's wife survived G, and even if she was pregnant at G's death or even if A had deposited sperm in a sperm bank prior to his death, it must be assumed that all of A's children are in being at G's death.
                            A's children are, therefore, their own validating lives. (Note that subsection (d) requires that in determining whether an individual is a validating life, the possibility that a child will be born to "an" individual after
                            the individual's death must be disregarded. The validating life and the individual whose having a post-death child is disregarded need not be the same individual.) Each one of A's children, all of whom under subsection (d)
                            are regarded as alive at G's death, will either reach the age of 25 or fail to do so within his or her own lifetime. To say this another way, it is certain to be known no later than at the time of the death of each child whether
                            or not that child survived to the required age.

         Validating Life Can Be Survivor of Group
        </i> . In appropriate cases, the validating life need not be individualized at first. Rather the validating life can initially (i.e., when the interest was created) be the unidentified survivor of a group of individuals.
                            It is common in such cases to say that the members of the group are the validating
                            <i>
         lives
        </i> , but the true meaning of the statement is that the validating
                            <i>
         life
        </i> is the member of the group who turns out to live the longest. As the court said in Skatterwood v. Edge, 1 Salk. 229, 91 Eng. Rep. 203 (K.B. 1697), "for let the lives be never so many, there must be a survivor,
                            and so it is but the length of that life; for Twisden used to say, the candles were all lighted at once."

                            The nonvested property interest in favor of G's grandchildren who attain 21 is valid under Section 1(a)(1). The validating life is that one of G's children who turns out to live the longest. Since under subsection (d), it must be assumed that none of
                            G's children will have post-death children, it is regarded as impossible for any of G's grandchildren to be alive and under 21 beyond the 21-year period following the death of G's last surviving child.

                            to pay the corpus to G's great-grandchildren then living. G's children all predeceased him, but several grandchildren were living at G's death. One of G's predeceased children (his son, A) had deposited sperm in a sperm bank.
                            A's widow was living at G's death.

                            The nonvested property interest in favor of G's great-grandchildren is valid under Section 1(a)(1). The validating life is the last surviving grandchild among the grandchildren living at G's death. Under subsection (d), the possibility that A will have
                            a child conceived after G's death must be disregarded. Note that subsection (d) requires that in determining whether an individual is a validating life, the possibility that a child will be born to "an" individual after the
                            individual's death is disregarded. The validating life and the individual whose having a post-death child is disregarded need not be the same individual. Thus in this example, by disregarding the possibility that
                            <i>
         A
        </i> will have a conceived-after-death child, G's
                            <i>
         last surviving grandchild
        </i> becomes the validating life because G's last surviving grandchild is deemed to have been alive at G's death, when the great-grandchildren's interests were created.

                            surviving child, to pay the corpus and accumulated income to G's then-living descendants, per stirpes; if none, to X Charity. At G's death his child (A) was 6 years old, and G's wife (W) was pregnant. After G's death, W gave

                            The nonvested property interests in favor of G's descendants and in favor of X Charity are valid under Section 1(a)(1). The validating life is A. Under subsection (d), the possibility that a child will be born to an individual after the individual's death

                            subsequently born viable, applies to this question. Thus, subsection (d) does

         not
        </i> prevent B from being an income beneficiary under G's trust, nor does it prevent a descendant in gestation on the 21st anniversary of the death of G's last surviving child from being a member of the class of G's
                            "then-living descendants," as long as such descendant has no then-living ancestor who takes instead.

                            might not validate the other interests. Since it is not necessary that the same validating life be used for all interests created by a disposition, the search for a validating life for each of the other interests must be undertaken
                            separately.

         Perpetuity Saving Clauses and Similar Provisions
        </i> . Knowledgeable lawyers almost routinely insert perpetuity saving clauses into instruments they draft. Saving clauses contain two components, the first of which is the
                            <i>
         perpetuity-period component
        </i> . This component typically requires the trust or other arrangement to terminate no later than 21 years after the death of the last survivor of a group of individuals designated therein by name or class. (The lives
                            of corporations, animals, or sequoia trees cannot be used.) The second component of saving clauses is the
                            <i>
         gift-over component
        </i> . This component expressly creates a gift over that is guaranteed to vest at the termination of the period set forth in the perpetuity-period component, but only if the trust or other arrangement has not terminated
                            earlier in accordance with its other terms.

                            It is important to note that regardless of what group of individuals is designated in the perpetuity-period component of a saving clause, the surviving member of the group is not necessarily the individual who would be the validating life for the nonvested
                            property interest or power of appointment in the absence of the saving clause. Without the saving clause, one or more interests or powers may in fact fail to satisfy the requirement of paragraph (1) of subsections (a), (b),
                            or (c) for initial validity. By being designated in the saving clause, however, the survivor of the group becomes the validating life for all interests and powers in the trust or other arrangement: The saving clause confers
                            on the last surviving member of the designated group the requisite causal connection between his or her death and the impossibility of any interest or power in the trust or other arrangement remaining in existence beyond the
                            21-year period following such individual's death.

         Example (6) - Valid Saving Clause Case
        </i> . A testamentary trust directs income to be paid to the testator's children for the life of the survivor, then to the testator's grandchildren for the life of the survivor, corpus on the death of the testator's
                            last living grandchild to such of the testator's descendants as the last living grandchild shall by will appoint; in default of appointment, to the testator's then-living descendants, per stirpes. A saving clause in the will
                            terminates the trust, if it has not previously terminated, 21 years after the death of the testator's last surviving descendant who was living at the testator's death. The testator was survived by children.

                        <p>
                            In the absence of the saving clause, the nongeneral power of appointment in the last living grandchild and the nonvested property interest in the gift-in-default clause in favor of the testator's descendants fail the test of Sections 1(a)(1) and 1(c)(1)
                            for initial validity. That is, were it not for the saving clause, there is no validating life. However, the surviving member of the designated group becomes the validating life, so that the saving clause does confer initial
                            validity on the nongeneral power of appointment and on the nonvested property interest under Sections 1(a)(1) and 1(c)(1).

                            If the governing instrument designates a group of individuals that would cause it to be impracticable to determine the death of the survivor, the common-law courts have developed the doctrine that the validity of the nonvested property interest or power
                            of appointment is determined as if the provision in the governing instrument did not exist. See cases cited in Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers) (1983), Reporter's Note No. 3 at p. 45. See also Restatement

                            validate the power of appointment or the nonvested property interest. Instead, the validity of the power of appointment and the nonvested property interest would be determined as if the provision in the governing instrument
                            did not exist. Since without the saving clause the power of appointment and the nonvested property interest would fail to satisfy the requirements of Sections 1(a)(1) and 1(c)(1) for initial validity, their validity would be
                            governed by Sections 1(a)(2) and 1(c)(2).

                            The application of the above common-law doctrine, which is not superseded by this Act and so remains in full force, is not limited to saving clauses. It also applies to trusts or other arrangements where the period thereof is directly linked to the life
                            of the survivor of a designated group of individuals. An example is a trust to pay the income to the grantor's descendants from time to time living, per stirpes, for the period of the life of the survivor of a designated group
                            of individuals living when the nonvested property interest or power of appointment in question was created, plus the 21-year period following the survivor's death; at the end of the 21-year period, the corpus is to be divided
                            among the grantor's then-living descendants, per stirpes, and if none, to the XYZ Charity. If the group of individuals so designated is such that it would be impracticable to determine the death of the survivor, the validity
                            of the disposition is determined as if the provision in the governing instrument did not exist. The term of the trust is therefore governed by the 90- year permissible vesting period of paragraph (2) of subsections (a), (b),
                            or (c) of the Statutory Rule.

                        <p>
                            Unlike the Common-Law Rule, the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities does not automatically invalidate nonvested property interests for which there is no validating life. A nonvested property interest that does not meet the requirements for validity under
                            Section 1(a)(1) might still be valid under the wait-and-see provisions of Section 1(a)(2). Such an interest is invalid under Section 1(a)(2) only if in actuality it does not vest (or terminate) during the permissible vesting
                            period. Such an interest becomes invalid, in other words, only if it is still in existence and nonvested when the permissible vesting period expires.

                            Since a wait-and-see rule against perpetuities, unlike the Common-law Rule, makes validity or invalidity turn on
                            <i>
         actual
        </i> post-creation events, it requires that an actual period of time be measured off during which the contingencies attached to an interest are allowed to work themselves out to a final resolution. The Statutory Rule
                            Against Perpetuities establishes a permissible vesting period of 90 years. Nonvested property interests that have neither vested nor terminated at the expiration of the 90-year permissible vesting period become invalid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As explained in the Prefatory Note, the permissible vesting period of 90 years is
                            <i>
         not
        </i> an arbitrarily selected period of time. On the contrary, the 90-year period represents a reasonable approximation of - a proxy for - the period of time that would,
                            <i>
         on average,
        </i> be produced through the use of an actual set of measuring lives identified by statute and then adding the traditional 21-year tack-on period after the death of the survivor.

                        <p>
                            One of the harsh aspects of the invalidating side of the Common-Law Rule, against which the adoption of the wait-and-see element in Section 1(a)(2) is designed to relieve, is that nonvested property interests at common law are invalid even though the
                            invalidating chain of possible events
                            <i>
         almost
        </i> certainly will
                            <i>
         not
        </i> happen. In such cases, the violation of the Common-law Rule could be said to be merely technical. Nevertheless, at common law, the nonvested property interest is invalid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cases of technical violation fall generally into discrete categories, identified and named by Professor Leach in
                            <i>
         Perpetuities in a Nutshell
        </i> , 51 Harv.L.Rev. 638 (1938), as the fertile octogenarian, the administrative contingency, and the unborn widow. The following three examples illustrate how Section 1(a)(2) affects these categories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>
         Example (7) - Fertile Octogenarian Case
        </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the net income therefrom "to A for life, then to A's children for the life of the survivor, and upon the death of A's last surviving child to pay the
                            corpus of the trust to A's grandchildren." G was survived by A (a female who had passed menopause) and by A's two adult children (X and Y).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The remainder interest in favor of G's grandchildren would be invalid at common law, and consequently is not validated by Section 1(a)(1). There is no validating life because, under the common law's conclusive presumption of lifetime fertility, which
                            is not superseded by this Act (see Part H, below), A
                            <i>
         might
        </i> have a third child (Z), conceived and born after G's death, who will have a child conceived and born more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, X, and Y.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under Section 1(a)(2), however, the remote possibility of the occurrence of this chain of events does not invalidate the grandchildren's interest. The interest becomes invalid only if it remains in existence and nonvested 90 years after G's death. The
                            chance that the grandchildren's remainder interest will become invalid under Section 1(a)(2) is negligible.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The remainder interest in favor of A's grandchildren would be invalid at common law, and consequently is not validated by Section 1(a)(1). The final distribution of G's estate
                            <i>
         might
        </i> not occur within 21 years of G's death, and after G's death grandchildren might be conceived and born who might survive or fail to survive the final distribution of G's estate more than 21 years after the death
                            of the survivor of G's children and grandchildren who were living at G's death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under Section 1(a)(2), however, the remote possibility of the occurrence of this chain of events does not invalidate the grandchildren's remainder interest. The interest becomes invalid only if it remains in existence and nonvested 90 years after G's
                            death. Since it is almost certain that the final distribution of G's estate will occur well within this 90-year period, the chance that the grandchildren's interest will be invalid is negligible.

                            <i>
         Example (9) - Unborn Widow Case
        </i> . G devised property in trust, the income to be paid "to my son A for life, then to A's spouse for her life, and upon the death of the survivor of A and his spouse, the corpus to be delivered to A's then living
                            descendants." G was survived by A, by A's wife (W), and by their adult children (X and Y).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unless the interest in favor of A's "spouse" is construed to refer only to W, rather than to whoever is A's spouse when he dies, if anyone, the remainder interest in favor of A's descendants would be invalid at common law, and consequently is not validated
                            by Section 1(a)(1). There is no validating life because A's spouse
                            <i>
         might
        </i> not be W; A's spouse might be someone who was conceived and born after G's death; she might outlive the death of the survivor of A, W, X, and Y by more than 21 years; and descendants of A might be born or die before
                            the death of A's spouse but after the 21-year period following the death of the survivor of A, W, X, and Y.

                            Under Section 1(a)(2), however, the remote possibility of the occurrence of this chain of events does not invalidate the descendants' remainder interest. The interest becomes invalid only if it remains in existence and nonvested 90 years after G's death.
                            The chance that the descendants' remainder interest will become invalid under the Statutory Rule is small.

         Age Contingencies in Excess of 21
        </i> . Another category of technical violation of the Common-Law Rule arises in cases of age contingencies in excess of 21 where the takers cannot be their own validating lives (unlike Example (2), above). The violation
                            of the Common-law Rule falls into the technical category because the insertion of a saving clause would in almost all cases allow the disposition to be carried out as written. In effect, the Statutory Rule operates like the
                            perpetuity-period component of a saving clause.

        </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then to A's children; the corpus of the trust is to be equally divided among A's children who reach the age of 30." G was survived
                            by A, by A's spouse (H), and by A's two children (X and Y), both of whom were under the age of 30 when G died.

                            The remainder interest in favor of A's children who reach 30 is a class gift. At common law, the interests of
                            <i>
         all
        </i> potential class members must be valid or the class gift is totally invalid. Leake v. Robinson, 2 Mer. 363, 35 Eng. Rep. 979 (Ch. 1817). This Act does not supersede the all-or-nothing rule for class gifts (see Part
                            G, below), and so the all-or-nothing rule continues to apply under this Act. Although X and Y will either reach 30 or die under 30 within their own lifetimes, there is at G's death the possibility that A will have an afterborn
                            child (Z) who will reach 30 or die under 30 more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, H, X, and Y. The class gift would be invalid at common law and consequently is not validated by Section 1(a)(1).

                            Under Section 1(a)(2), however, the possibility of the occurrence of this chain of events does not invalidate the children's remainder interest. The interest becomes invalid only if an interest of a class member remains nonvested 90 years after G's death.

                            Although unlikely, suppose that at A's death Z's age is such that he could be alive and under the age of 30 at the expiration of the allowable waiting period. Suppose further that at A's death X or Y or both is over the age of 30. The court, upon the
                            petition of an interested person, must under Section 3 reform G's disposition. See Example (3) in the Comment to Section 3.

                            The various persons connected to a power of appointment are identified by a special terminology. The "donor" is the person who created the power of appointment. The "donee" is the person who holds the power of appointment, i.e., the powerholder. The "objects"
                            are the persons to whom an appointment can be made. The "appointees" are the persons to whom an appointment has been made. The "takers in default" are the persons whose property interests are subject to being defeated by the
                            exercise of the power of appointment and who take the property to the extent the power is not effectively exercised. Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)

                            A power of appointment is "general" if it is exercisable in favor of the donee of the power, the donee's creditors, the donee's estate, or the creditors of the donee's estate. A power of appointment that is not general is a "nongeneral" power of appointment.

                            A power of appointment is "presently exercisable" if, at the time in question, the donee can by an exercise of the power create an interest in or a power of appointment over the appointive property. Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)

                            uncertain event. Since a power of appointment terminates on the donee's death, a deferral of a power's present exercisability until a future time (even a time certain) imposes a condition precedent that the donee be alive at
                            that future time.

                            A power of appointment is a "fiduciary" power if it is held by a fiduciary and is exercisable by the fiduciary in a fiduciary capacity. A power of appointment that is exercisable in an individual capacity is a "nonfiduciary" power. As used in this Act,
                            the term "power of appointment" refers to "fiduciary" and to "nonfiduciary" powers, unless the context indicates otherwise.

                            Although Gray's formulation of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities does not speak directly of powers of appointment, the Common-law Rule
                            <i>
         is
        </i> applicable to powers of appointment (other than presently exercisable general powers of appointment). The principle of subsections (b)(1) and (c)(1) is that a power of appointment that satisfies the Common-law
                            Rule Against Perpetuities is valid under the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, and consequently it can be validly exercised, without being subjected to a waiting period during which the power's validity is in abeyance.

                        <p>
                            Two different tests for validity are employed at common law, depending on what type of power is at issue. In the case of a
                            <i>
         nongeneral power
        </i> (whether or not presently exercisable) and in the case of a
                            <i>
         general testamentary power
        </i> , the power is initially valid if, when the power was created, it is certain that the latest possible time that the power can be exercised is no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then in being.
                            In the case of a
                            <i>
         general power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent
        </i> , the power is initially valid if it is then certain that the condition precedent to its exercise will either be satisfied or become impossible to satisfy no later than 21 years after the death of an individual
                            then in being. Subsections (b)(1) and (c)(1) codify these rules. Under either test, initial validity depends on the existence of a validating life. The procedure for determining whether a validating life exists is essentially
                            the same procedure explained in Part B, above, pertaining to nonvested property interests.

                            A's power, which is a general testamentary power, is valid as of its creation under Section 1(c)(1). The test is whether or not the power can be exercised beyond 21 years after the death of an individual in being when the power was created (G's death).
                            Since A's power cannot be exercised after A's death, the validating life is A, who was in being at G's death.

                            A's power, which is a nongeneral power, is valid as of its creation under Section 1(c)(1). The validating life is A; the analysis leading to validity is the same as applied in Example (11), above.

                            survived by his daughter (A), who was then childless.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The power in A's first born child, which is a general power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent, is valid as of its creation under Section 1(b)(1). The power is subject to a condition precedent - that A have a child - but this is
                            a contingency that under subsection (d) is deemed certain to be resolved one way or the other within A's lifetime. A is therefore the validating life: The power cannot remain subject to the condition precedent after A's death.
                            Note that the latest possible time that the power can be exercised is at the death of A's first born child, which might occur beyond 21 years after the death of A (and anyone else who was alive when G died). Consequently, if
                            the power conferred on A's first born child had been a nongeneral power or a general testamentary power, the power could not be validated by Section 1(c)(1); instead, the power's validity would be governed by Section 1(c)(2).

                            <i>
         general power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent
        </i> is invalid as of the time of its creation if the condition
                            <i>
         might
        </i> neither be satisfied nor become impossible to satisfy within a life in being plus 21 years. A

         nongeneral power
        </i> (whether or not presently exercisable) or a
                            <i>
         general testamentary power
        </i> is invalid as of the time of its creation if it might not terminate (by irrevocable exercise or otherwise) within a life in being plus 21 years.

                            Sections 1(b)(2) and 1(c)(2), by adopting the wait-and-see method of perpetuity reform, shift the ground of invalidity from possible to actual post-creation events. Under these subsections, a power of appointment that would have violated the Common-law
                            Rule, and therefore fails the subsection (b)(1) or (c)(1) tests for
                            <i>
         initial
        </i> validity, is nevertheless not invalid as of the time of its creation. Instead, its validity is in abeyance. A general power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent is invalid only if
                            <i>
         in actuality
        </i> the condition neither is satisfied nor becomes impossible to satisfy within the 90-year permissible vesting period. A nongeneral power or a general testamentary power is invalid only if
                            <i>
         in actuality
        </i> it does not terminate (by irrevocable exercise or otherwise) within the 90-year permissible period.

         initial

                            to accumulate the income or to distribute it in equal or unequal shares among A's children until the death of the survivor; and on the death of A's last surviving child to pay the corpus and accumulated income (if any) to B.
                            The trustee was also granted the discretionary power to invade the corpus on behalf of the permissible recipient or recipients of the income.

                            The trustee's nongeneral powers to invade corpus and to accumulate or spray income among A's children are not excluded by Section 4(4), nor are they initially valid under Section 1(c)(1). Their validity is, therefore, governed by Section 1(c)(2). Both
                            powers become invalid thereunder, and hence no longer exercisable, 90 years after G's death.

                            It is doubtful that the powers will become invalid, because the trust will probably terminate by its own terms earlier than the expiration of the permissible 90-year period. But if the powers do become invalid, and hence no longer exercisable, they become
                            invalid as of the time the permissible 90-year period expires. Any exercises of either power that took place before the expiration of the permissible 90-year period are not invalidated retroactively. In addition, if the powers
                            do become invalid, a court in an appropriate proceeding must reform the instrument in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.

                        <p>
                            The fact that a power of appointment is valid, either because it (i) was not subject to the Statutory Rule to begin with, (ii) is initially valid under Sections 1(b)(1) or 1(c)(1), or (iii) becomes valid under Sections 1(b)(2) or 1(c)(2), means merely
                            that the power can be validly exercised. It does not mean that any exercise that the donee decides to make is valid. The validity of the interests or powers created by the exercise of a valid power is a separate matter, governed
                            by the provisions of this Act. A key factor in deciding the validity of such appointed interests or appointed powers is determining when they were created for purposes of this Act. Under Section 2, as explained in the Comment
                            thereto, the time of creation is when the power was exercised if it was a presently exercisable general power; and if it was a nongeneral power or a general testamentary power, the time of creation is when the power was created.
                            This is the rule generally accepted at common law (see Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)

                            G's power and his appointment are valid. The power and the appointed interests were created at M's death when the power was created, not on G's death when it was exercised. See Section 2. G's power passes Section 1(c)(1)'s test for initial validity: G
                            himself is the validating life. G's appointment also passes Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity: Since B was dead at M's death, the validating life is the survivor of B's children, X and Y.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suppose that G's power was exercisable only in favor of G's own descendants, and that G appointed the identical interests in favor of his own children and grandchildren. Suppose further that at M's death, G had two children, X and Y, and that a third
                            child, Z, was born later. X, Y, and Z survived G. In this case, the remainder interest in favor of G's grandchildren would not pass Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity. Its validity would be governed by Section 1(a)(2),
                            under which it would be valid if G's last surviving child died within 90 years after M's death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If G's power were a general testamentary power of appointment, rather than a nongeneral power, the solution would be the same. The period of the Statutory Rule with respect to interests created by the exercise of a general testamentary power starts to
                            run when the power was created (at M's death, in this example), not when the power was exercised (at G's death).

         Example (19) - Exercise of a Presently Exercisable General Power of Appointment
        </i> . G was the life income beneficiary of a trust and the donee of a presently exercisable general power of appointment over the succeeding remainder interest. G exercised the power by deed, directing the trustee
                            after his death to pay the income to G's children in equal shares for the life of the survivor, and upon the death of his last surviving child to pay the corpus of the trust to his grandchildren.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The validity of G's power is not in question: A presently exercisable general power of appointment is not subject to the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities. G's appointment, however, is subject to the Statutory Rule. If G reserved a power to revoke his
                            appointment, the remainder interest in favor of G's grandchildren passes Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity. Under Section 2, the appointed remainder interest was created at G's death. The validating life for his grandchildren's
                            remainder interest is G's last surviving child.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If G's appointment were irrevocable, however, the grandchildren's remainder interest fails the test of Section 1(a)(1) for initial validity. Under Section 2, the appointed remainder interest was created upon delivery of the deed exercising G's power (or
                            when the exercise otherwise became effective). Since the validity of the grandchildren's remainder interest is governed by Section 1(a)(2), the remainder interest becomes invalid, and the disposition becomes subject to reformation
                            under Section 3, if G's last surviving child lives beyond 90 years after the effective date of G's appointment.

         Example (20) - Exercises of Successively Created Nongeneral Powers of Appointment
        </i> . G devised property to A for life, remainder to such of A's descendants as A shall appoint. At his death, A exercised his nongeneral power by appointing to his child B for life, remainder to such of B's descendants
                            as B shall appoint. At his death, B exercised his nongeneral power by appointing to his child C for life, remainder to C's children. A and B were living at G's death. Thereafter, C was born. A later died, survived by B and
                            C. B then died survived by C.

                            A's nongeneral power passes Section 1(c)(1)'s test for initial validity. A is the validating life. B's nongeneral power, created by A's appointment, also passes Sections 1(c)(1)'s test for initial validity. Since under Section 2 the appointed interests
                            and powers are created at G's death, and since B was then alive, B is the validating life for his nongeneral power. (If B had been born after G's death, however, his power would have failed Section 1(c)(1)'s test for initial
                            validity; its validity would be governed by Section 1(c)(2), and would turn on whether or not it was exercised by B within 90 years after G's death.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although B's power is valid, his exercise may be partly invalid. The remainder interest in favor of C's children fails the test of Section 1(a)(1) for initial validity. The period of the Statutory Rule begins to run at G's death, under Section 2. (Since
                            B's power was a nongeneral power, B's appointment under the common-law relation back doctrine of powers of appointment is treated as having been made by A. If B's appointment related back no further than that, of course, it
                            would have been validated by Section 1(a)(1) because C was alive at A's death. However, A's power was also a nongeneral power, so relation back goes another step. A's appointment - which now includes B's appointment - is treated
                            as having been made by G.) Since C was not alive at G's death, he cannot be the validating life. And, since C might have more children more than 21 years after the deaths of A and B and any other individual who was alive at
                            G's death, the remainder interest in favor of his children is not initially validated by Section 1(a)(1). Instead, its validity is governed by Section 1(a)(2), and turns on whether or not C dies within 90 years after G's death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that if either A's power or B's power (or both) had been a general testamentary power rather than a nongeneral power, the above solution would not change. However, if either A's power or B's power (or both) had been a presently exercisable general
                            power, B's appointment would have passed Sections 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity. (If A had the presently exercisable general power, the appointed interests and power would be created at A's death, not G's; and if the
                            presently exercisable general power were held by B, the appointed interests and power would be created at B's death.)

         Common-Law "Second-look" Doctrine
        </i> . As indicated above, both at common law and under this Act (except for purposes of Section 5 only, as explained in the Comment to Section 5), appointed interests and powers established by the exercise of a general
                            testamentary power or a nongeneral power are created when the power was created, not when the power was exercised. In applying this principle, the common law recognizes a so-called doctrine of second look, under which the facts
                            existing on the date of the exercise are taken into account in determining the validity of appointed interests and appointed powers. E.g.,
                            <i>
         Warren's Estate
        </i> , 320 Pa. 112, 182 A. 396 (1930);
                            <i>
         In re Estate of Bird
        </i> , 225 Cal.App.2d 196, 37 Cal.Rptr. 288 (1964). The common-law's second-look doctrine in effect constitutes a limited wait-and-see doctrine, and is therefore subsumed under but not totally superseded by this Act.
                            The following example, which is a variation of Example (18) above, illustrates how the second-look doctrine operates at common law and how the situation would be analyzed under this Act.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>
         Example (21) - Second-look Case
        </i> . G was the life income beneficiary of a trust and the donee of a nongeneral power of appointment over the succeeding remainder interest, exercisable in favor of G's descendants. The trust was created by the will
                            of his mother, M, who predeceased him. G exercised his power by his will, directing the income to be paid after his death to his children for the life of the survivor, and upon the death of his last surviving child, to pay
                            the corpus of the trust to his grandchildren. At M's death, G had two children, X and Y. No further children were born to G, and at his death X and Y were still living.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The common-law solution of this example is as follows: G's appointment is valid under the Common-law Rule. Although the period of the Rule begins to run at M's death, the facts existing at G's death can be taken into account. This second look at the facts
                            discloses that G had no additional children. Thus the possibility of additional children, which existed at M's death when the period of the Rule began to run, is disregarded. The survivor of X and Y, therefore, becomes the
                            validating life for the remainder interest in favor of G's grandchildren, and G's appointment is valid. The common-law's second-look doctrine would not, however, save G's appointment if he actually had one or more children
                            after M's death and if at least one of these after-born children survived G.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under this Act, if no additional children are born to G after M's death, the common-law second-look doctrine can be invoked as of G's death to declare G's appointment then to be valid under Section 1(a)(1); no further waiting is necessary. However, if
                            additional children
                            <i>
         are
        </i> born to G and one or more of them survives G, Section 1(a)(2) applies and the validity of G's appointment depends on G's last surviving child dying within 90 years after M's death.

         Effect of Certain "Later-of" Type Language
        </i> . Section 1(e) was added to the Uniform Act in 1990. It primarily applies to a non-traditional type of "later-of" clause (described below). Use of that type of clause might have produced unintended consequences,
                            which are now rectified by the addition of Section 1(e).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In general, perpetuity saving or termination clauses can be used in either of two ways. The predominant use of such clauses is as an override clause. That is, the clause is not an integral part of the dispositive terms of the trust, but operates independently
                            of the dispositive terms; the clause provides that all interests must vest no later than at a specified time in the future, and sometimes also provides that the trust must then terminate, but only if any interest has not previously
                            vested or if the trust has not previously terminated. The other use of such a clause is as an integral part of the dispositive terms of the trust; that is, the clause is the provision that directly regulates the duration of
                            the trust. Traditional perpetuity saving or termination clauses do not use a "later-of" approach; they mark off the maximum time of vesting or termination only by reference to a 21-year period following the death of the survivor
                            of specified lives in being at the creation of the trust.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Section 1(e) applies to a non-traditional clause called a "later-of" (or "longer-of") clause. Such a clause might provide that the maximum time of vesting or termination of any interest or trust must occur no later than the later of (A) 21 years after
                            the death of the survivor of specified lives in being at the creation of the trust or (B) 90 years after the creation of the trust.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under the Uniform Act as originally promulgated, this type of "later-of" clause would not achieve a "later-of" result. If used as an override clause in conjunction with a trust whose terms were, by themselves, valid under the Common-law Rule, the "later-of"
                            clause did no harm. The trust would be valid under the Common-law Rule as codified in Section 1(a)(1) because the clause itself would neither postpone the vesting of any interest nor extend the duration of the trust. But, if
                            used either (1) as an override clause in conjunction with a trust whose terms were not valid under the Common-law Rule or (2) as the provision that directly regulated the duration of the trust, the "later-of" clause would not
                            cure the perpetuity violation in case (1) and would create a perpetuity violation in case (2). In neither case would the clause qualify the trust for validity at common law under Section 1(a)(1) because the clause would not
                            guarantee that all interests will be certain to vest or terminate no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then alive.** In any given case, 90 years can turn out to be longer than the period produced by the specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years
                            language. **By substantial analogous authority, the specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years prong of the "later-of" clause under discussion is not sustained by the separability doctrine (described in Part H of the Comment to
                            Section 1). See, e.g., Restatement of Property
                            <span class="s3">

                            of the separability doctrine is also supported by perpetuity policy, as described in the text above.

                        <p>
                            Because the clause would fail to qualify the trust for validity under the Common-law Rule of Section 1(a)(1), the nonvested interests in the trust would be subject to the wait-and-see element of Section 1(a)(2) and vulnerable to a reformation suit under
                            Section 3. Under Section 1(a)(2), an interest that is not valid at common law is invalid unless it actually vests or terminates within 90 years after its creation. Section 1(a)(2) does not grant such nonvested interests a permissible
                            vesting period of either 90 years or a period of 21 years after the death of the survivor of specified lives in being. Section 1(a)(2) only grants such interests a period of 90 years in which to vest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The operation of Section 1(a), as outlined above, is also supported by perpetuity policy. If Section 1(a) allowed a "later-of" clause to achieve a "later-of" result, it would authorize an improper use of the 90-year permissible vesting period of Section
                            1(a)(2). The 90-year period of Section 1(a)(2) is designed to approximate the period that,
                            <i>
         on average
        </i> , would be produced by using actual lives in being plus 21 years. Because in any given case the period actually produced by lives in being plus 21 years can be shorter or longer than 90 years, an attempt to utilize
                            a 90-year period in a "later-of" clause improperly seeks to turn the 90-year average into a minimum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Set against this background, the addition of Section 1(e) is quite beneficial. Section 1(e) limits the effect of this type of "later-of" language to 21 years after the death of the survivor of the specified lives, in effect transforming the clause into
                            a traditional perpetuity saving/termination clause. By doing so, Section 1(e) grants initial validity to the trust under the Common-law Rule as codified in Section 1(a)(1) and precludes a reformation suit under Section 3.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that Section 1(e) covers variations of the "later-of" clause described above, such as a clause that postpones vesting until the later of (A) 20 years after the death of the survivor of specified lives in being or (B) 89 years. Section 1(e) does not,
                            however, apply to all dispositions that incorporate a "later-of" approach. To come under Section 1(e), the specified-lives prong must include a tack-on period of up to 21 years. Without a tack-on period, a "later-of" disposition,
                            unless valid at common law, comes under Section 1(a)(2) and is given 90 years in which to vest. An example would be a disposition that creates an interest that is to vest upon "the later of the death of my widow or 30 years
                            after my death."

                            Section 1433(b)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 generally exempts ("grandfathers") trusts from the federal generation-skipping transfer tax that were irrevocable on September 25, 1985. This section adds, however, that the exemption shall apply "only
                            to the extent that such transfer is not made out of corpus added to the trust after September 25, 1985." The provisions of Section 1433(b)(2) were first implemented by Temp. Treas. Reg.

         §
        </span> 26.2601-1, promulgated by T.D. 8187 on March 14, 1988. Insofar as the Uniform Act is concerned, a key feature of that temporary regulation is the concept that the statutory reference to "corpus added to the
                            trust after September 25, 1985" not only covers actual post-9/25/85 transfers of new property or corpus to a grandfathered trust but "constructive" additions as well. Under the temporary regulation as first promulgated, a "constructive"
                            addition occurs if, after 9/25/85, the donee of a nongeneral power of appointment exercises that power "in a manner that may postpone or suspend the vesting, absolute ownership or power of alienation of an interest in property
                            for a period, measured from the date of creation of the trust, extending beyond any life in being at the date of creation of the trust plus a period of 21 years. If a power is exercised by creating another power it will be
                            deemed to be exercised to whatever extent the second power may be exercised." Temp. Treas. Reg.

                            Because the Uniform Act was promulgated in 1986 and applies only prospectively, any "grandfathered" trust would have become irrevocable prior to the enactment of the Uniform Act in any state. Nevertheless, the second sentence of Section 5(a) extends the
                            wait-and-see approach to post-effective-date exercises of nongeneral powers even if the power itself was created prior to the effective date of the Uniform Act in any state. Consequently, a post-effective-date exercise of a
                            nongeneral power of appointment created in a "grandfathered" trust could come under the provisions of the Uniform Act.

         §
        </span> 26.2601-1(b)(1)(v)(B)(2) (1988), as first promulgated, could have jeopardized the grandfathered status of an exempt trust if (1) the trust created a nongeneral power of appointment, (2) the donee exercised that
                            nongeneral power, and (3) the Uniform Act is the perpetuity law applicable to the donee's exercise. This possibility arose not only because the donee's exercise itself might come under the 90-year permissible vesting period
                            of Section 1(a)(2) if it otherwise violated the Common-law Rule and hence was not validated under Section 1(a)(1). The possibility also arose in a less obvious way if the donee's exercise created another nongeneral power. The
                            last sentence of the temporary regulation states that "if a power is exercised by creating another power it will be deemed to be exercised to whatever extent the second power may be exercised."

                        <p>
                            In late March 1990, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) filed a formal request with the Treasury Department asking that measures be taken to coordinate the regulation with the Uniform Act. By the Treasury Letter referred
                            to above, the Treasury Department responded by stating that it "will amend the temporary regulations to accommodate the 90-year period under USRAP as originally promulgated [in 1986] or as amended [in 1990 by the addition of
                            subsection (e)]." This should effectively remove the possibility of loss of grandfathered status under the Uniform Act merely because the donee of a nongeneral power created in a grandfathered trust inadvertently exercises
                            that power in violation of the Common-law Rule or merely because the donee exercises that power by creating a second nongeneral power that might, in the future, be inadvertently exercised in violation of the Common-law Rule.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Treasury Letter states, however, that any effort by the donee of a nongeneral power in a grandfathered trust to obtain a "later-of" specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years or 90-years approach will be treated as a constructive addition, unless that
                            effort is nullified by state law. As explained above, the Uniform Act, as originally promulgated in 1986 or as amended in 1990 by the addition of Section 1(e), nullifies any direct effort to obtain a "later-of" approach by
                            the use of a "later-of" clause.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Treasury Letter states that an indirect effort to obtain a "later-of" approach would also be treated as a constructive addition that would bring grandfathered status to an end, unless the attempt to obtain the later-of approach is nullified by state
                            law. The Treasury Letter indicates that an indirect effort to obtain a "later-of" approach could arise if the donee of a nongeneral power successfully attempts to prolong the duration of a grandfathered trust by switching from
                            a specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years perpetuity period to a 90-year perpetuity period, or vice versa. Donees of nongeneral powers in grandfathered trusts would therefore be well advised to resist any temptation to wait
                            until it becomes clear or reasonably predictable which perpetuity period will be longer and then make a switch to the longer period if the governing instrument creating the power utilized the shorter period. No such attempted
                            switch and no constructive addition will occur if in each instance a traditional specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years perpetuity saving clause is used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any such attempted switch is likely in any event to be nullified by state law and, if so, the attempted switch will not be treated as a constructive addition. For example, suppose that the original grandfathered trust contained a standard perpetuity saving
                            clause declaring that all interests in the trust must vest no later than 21 years after the death of the survivor of specified lives in being. In exercising a nongeneral power created in that trust, any indirect effort by the
                            donee to obtain a "later-of" approach by adopting a 90-year perpetuity saving clause will likely be nullified by Section 1(e). If that exercise occurs at a time when it has become clear or reasonably predictable that the 90-year
                            period will prove longer, the donee's exercise would constitute language in a governing instrument that seeks to operate in effect to postpone the vesting of any interest until the later of the specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years
                            period or 90 years. Under Section 1(e), "that language is inoperative to the extent it produces a period of time that exceeds 21 years after the death of the survivor of the specified lives."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Quite apart from Section 1(e), the relation-back doctrine generally recognized in the exercise of nongeneral powers stands as a doctrine that could potentially be invoked to nullify an attempted switch from one perpetuity period to the other perpetuity
                            period. Under that doctrine, interests created by the exercise of a nongeneral power are considered created by the donor of that power. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Property, Donative Transfers

         §
        </span> 11.1 comment b (1986). As such, the maximum vesting period applicable to interests created by the exercise of a nongeneral power would apparently be covered by the perpetuity saving clause in the document that
                            created the power, notwithstanding any different period the donee purports to adopt.

                            As noted at the beginning of this Comment, the courts in interpreting the Common-law Rule developed several subsidiary doctrines. This Act does not supersede those subsidiary doctrines except to the extent the provisions of this Act conflict with them.

         Constructional Preference for Validity

                            provisions so construed. J. Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities

                            The constructional preference for validity is not superseded by this Act, but its role is likely to be different. The situation is likely to be that one of the constructions to which the ambiguous instrument is fairly susceptible would result in validity
                            under Section 1(a)(1), 1(b)(1), or 1(c)(1), but the other construction does not necessarily result in invalidity; rather it results in the interest's validity being governed by Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2). Nevertheless,
                            even though the result of adopting the other construction is not as harsh as it is at common law, it is expected that the courts will incline toward the construction that validates the disposition under Section 1(a)(1), 1(b)(1),
                            or 1(c)(1).

         Conclusive Presumption of Lifetime Fertility
        </i> . At common law, all individuals - regardless of age, sex, or physical condition - are
                            <i>
         conclusively
        </i> presumed to be able to have children throughout their entire lifetimes. This principle is not superseded by this Act, and in view of new advances in medical science that allow women to become pregnant after menopause
                            by way of test-tube fertilization (see Sauer, Paulson &amp; Lobo,
                            <i>

        </i> , 323 N.Eng.J.Med. 1157 (1990)) and the widely accepted rule of construction that adopted children are presumptively included in class gifts, the conclusive presumption of lifetime fertility is not unrealistic.
                            Since even elderly individuals probably cannot be excluded from adopting children based on their ages alone, the possibility of having children by adoption is seldom extinct. See, generally, Waggoner

                            Section 1(a)(1).

         Act Supersedes Doctrine of Infectious Invalidity

                            disposition. The question turns on whether the general dispositive scheme of the transferor will be better carried out by eliminating only the invalid interest or by eliminating other interests as well. This is a question that
                            is answered on a case-by-case basis. Several items are relevant to the question, including who takes the stricken interests in place of those the transferor designated to take.

         reform

         Separability
        </i> . The common law's separability doctrine is that when an interest is
                            <i>
         expressly
        </i> subject to alternative contingencies, the situation is treated as if two interests were created in the same person or class. Each interest is judged separately; the invalidity of one of the interests does not necessarily
                            cause the other one to be invalid. This common-law principle was established in Longhead v. Phelps, 2 Wm.Bl. 704, 96 Eng. Rep. 414 (K.B. 1770), and is followed in this country. L. Simes &amp; A. Smith, The Law of Future Interests

                            If the interest contingent on X-event but not the one contingent on Y-event is invalid, the consequence of separating B's interest into two is that only one of them, the one contingent on X-event, is invalid. B still has a
                            valid interest - the one contingent on the occurrence of Y-event.

                            The separability principle is not superseded by this Act. As illustrated in the following example, its invocation will usually result in one of the interests being initially validated by Section 1(a)(1) and the validity of the other interests being governed
                            by Section 1(a)(2).

         Example (22) - Separability Case
        </i> . G devised real property "to A for life, then to A's children who survive A and reach 25, but if none of A's children survives A or if none of A's children who survives A reaches 25, then to B." G was survived
                            by his brother (B), by his daughter (A), by A's husband (H), and by A's two minor children (X and Y).

                        <p>
                            The remainder interest in favor of A's children who reach 25 fails the test of Section 1(a)(1) for initial validity. Its validity is, therefore, governed by Section 1(a)(2) and depends on each of A's children doing any one of the following things within
                            90 years after G's death: predeceasing A, surviving A and failing to reach 25, or surviving A and reaching 25.

                        <p>
                            Under the separability doctrine, B has two interests. One of them is contingent on none of A's children surviving A. That interest passes Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity; the validating life is A. B's other interest, which is contingent on
                            none of A's surviving children reaching 25, fails Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity. Its validity is governed by Section 1(a)(2) and depends on each of A's surviving children either reaching 25 or dying under 25 within
                            90 years after G's death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suppose that after G's death, A has a third child (Z). A subsequently dies, survived by her husband (H) and by X, Y, and Z. This, of course, causes B's interest that was contingent on none of A's children surviving A to terminate. If X, Y, and Z had all
                            reached the age of 25 by the time of A's death, their interest would vest at A's death, and that would end the matter. If one or two, but not all three of them, had reached the age of 25 at A's death, B's other interest - the
                            one that was contingent on none of A's surviving children reaching 25 - would also terminate. As for the children's interest, if the after- born child Z's age was such at A's death that Z could not be alive and under the age
                            of 25 at the expiration of the allowable waiting period, the class gift in favor of the children would be valid under Section 1(a)(2), because none of those then under 25 could fail either to reach 25 or die under 25 after
                            the expiration of the allowable 90-year waiting period. If, however, Z's age at A's death was such that Z could be alive and under the age of 25 at the expiration of the 90-year permissible vesting period, the circumstances
                            requisite to reformation under Section 3(2) would arise, and the court would be justified in reforming G's disposition by reducing the age contingency with respect to Z to the age he would reach on the date when the permissible
                            vesting period is due to expire. See Example (3) in the Comment to Section 3. So reformed, the class gift in favor of A's children could not become invalid under Section 1(a)(2), and the children of A who had already reached
                            25 by the time of A's death could receive their shares immediately.

         The "All-or-Nothing" Rule with Respect to Class Gifts; the Specific Sum and Sub-Class Doctrines
        </i> . The common law applies an "all-or-nothing" rule with respect to class gifts, under which a class gift stands or falls as a whole. The all-or-nothing rule, usually attributed to Leake v. Robinson, 2 Mer. 363,
                            35 Eng. Rep. 979 (Ch. 1817), is commonly stated as follows: If the interest of any potential class member
                            <i>
         might
        </i> vest too remotely, the entire class gift violates the Rule. Although this Act does not supersede the basic idea of the much-maligned "all-or-nothing" rule, the evils sometimes attributed to it are substantially
                            if not entirely eliminated by the wait-and-see feature of the Statutory Rule and by the availability of reformation under Section 3, especially in the circumstances described in Sections 3(2) and (3). For illustrations of the
                            application of the all-or-nothing rule under this Act, see Examples (3), (4), and (6) in the Comment to Section 3.

                        <p>
                            The common law also recognizes a doctrine called the specific-sum doctrine, which is derived from Storrs v. Benbow, 3 De G.M. &amp; G. 390, 43 Eng. Rep. 153 (Ch. 1853), and states: If a specified sum of money is to be paid to each member of a class, the
                            interest of each class member is entitled to separate treatment and is valid or invalid under the Rule on its own. The common law also recognizes a doctrine called the sub-class doctrine, which is derived from Cattlin v. Brown,
                            11 Hare 372, 68 Eng. Rep. 1318 (Ch. 1853), and states: If the ultimate takers are not described as a single class but rather as a group of subclasses, and if the share to which each separate subclass is entitled will finally
                            be determined within the period of the Rule, the gifts to the different subclasses are separable for the purpose of the Rule. American Security &amp; Trust Co. v. Cramer, 175 F. Supp. 367 (D.D.C. 1959); Restatement of Property
                            <span class="s3">
         §
        </span> 389 (1944). The specific-sum and sub-class doctrines are not superseded by this Act. The operation of the specific-sum doctrine under this Act is illustrated in the following example.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>
         Example (23) - Specific-Sum Case
        </i> . G bequeathed "$10,000 to each child of A, born before or after my death, who attains 25." G was survived by A and by A's two children (X and Y). X but not Y had already reached 25 at G's death. After G's death
                            a third child (Z) was born to A.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the phrase "born before or after my death" had been omitted, the class would close as of G's death under the common-law's rule of construction known as the rule of convenience: The after-born child, Z, would not be entitled to a $10,000 bequest, and
                            the interests of both X and Y would be valid upon their creation at G's death. X's interest would be valid because it was initially vested; neither the Common-law Rule nor the Statutory Rule applies to interests that are vested
                            upon their creation. Although the interest of Y was not vested upon its creation, it would be initially valid under Section 1(a)(1) because Y would be his own validating life; Y will either reach 25 or die under 25 within his
                            own lifetime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The inclusion of the phrase "before or after my death," however, would probably be construed to mean that G intended after-born children to receive a $10,000 bequest. See
                            <i>
         Earle Estate
        </i> , 369 Pa. 52, 85 A.2d 90 (1951). Assuming that this construction were adopted, the specific-sum doctrine allows the interest of each child of A to be treated separately from the others for purposes of the Statutory
                            Rule. For the reasons cited above, the interests of X and Y are initially valid under Section 1(a)(1). The nonvested interest of Z, however, fails Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity; there is no validating life because
                            Z, who was not alive when the interest was created, could reach 25 or die under 25 more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, X, and Y. Under Section 1(a)(2), the validity of Z's interest depends on Z's reaching
                            (or failing to reach) 25 within 90 years after G's death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The operation of the sub-class doctrine under this Act is illustrated in the following example.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>
         Example (24) - Sub-Class Case
        </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then in equal shares to A's children for their respective lives; on the death of each child, the proportionate share of corpus
                            of the one so dying shall go to the children of such child." G was survived by A and by A's two children (X and Y). After G's death, another child (Z) was born to A. A now has died, survived by X, Y, and Z.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under the sub-class doctrine, each remainder interest in favor of the children of a child of A is treated separately from the others. This allows the remainder interest in favor of X's children and the remainder interest in favor of Y's children to be
                            validated under Section 1(a)(1). X is the validating life for the one, and Y is the validating life for the other.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The remainder interest in favor of the children of Z fails Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity; there is no validating life because Z, who was not alive when the interest was created, could have children more than 21 years after the death of the
                            survivor of A, X, and Y. Under Section 1(a)(2), the validity of the remainder interest in favor of Z's children depends on Z's dying within 90 years after G's death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note why both of the requirements of the sub-class rule are met. The ultimate takers are described as a group of sub-classes rather than as a single class: "children of the child so dying," as opposed to "grandchildren." The share to which each separate
                            sub-class is entitled is certain to be finally determined within a life in being plus 21 years: As of A's death, who is a life in being, it is certain to be known how many children he had surviving him; since in fact there
                            were three, we know that each sub-class will ultimately be entitled to one-third of the corpus, neither more nor less. The possible failure of the one-third share of Z's children does not increase to one-half the share going
                            to X's and Y's children; they still are entitled to only one-third shares. Indeed, should it turn out that X has children but Y does not, this would not increase the one-third share to which X's children are entitled.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>
         Example (25) - General Testamentary Powers - Sub-Class Case
        </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay income "to A for life, then in equal shares to A's children for their respective lives; on the death of each child, the proportionate share of corpus
                            of the one so dying shall go to such persons as the one so dying shall by will appoint; in default of appointment, to G's grandchildren in equal shares." G was survived by A and by A's two children (X and Y). After G's death,
                            another child (Z) was born to A.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The general testamentary powers conferred on each of A's children are entitled to separate treatment under the principles of the sub-class doctrine. See above. Consequently, the powers conferred on X and Y, A's children who were living at G's death, are
                            initially valid under Section 1(c)(1). But the general testamentary power conferred on Z, A's child who was born after G's death, fails the test of Section 1(c)(1) for
                            <i>
         initial
        </i> validity. The validity of Z's power is governed by Section 1(c)(2). Z's death must occur within 90 years after G's death if any provision in Z's will purporting to exercise his power is to be valid.

         Duration of Indestructible Trusts - Termination of Trusts by Beneficiaries
        </i> . The widely accepted view in American law is that the beneficiaries of a trust other than a charitable trust can compel its premature termination if all beneficiaries consent
                            <i>
         and
        </i> if such termination is not expressly restrained or impliedly restrained by the existence of a "material purpose" of the settlor in establishing the trust. Restatement (Second) of Trusts

                            1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2), the courts can be expected to determine that the applicable perpetuity period is 90 years.

        Subsection (a): General Principles of Property Law; When Nonvested Property Interests and Powers of Appointment are Created
       </i> . Under Section 1, the period of time allowed by the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities is marked off from the time of creation of the nonvested property interest or power of appointment in question. Section 5, with
                        certain exceptions, provides that the Act applies only to nonvested property interests and powers of appointment created on or after the effective date of the Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), and in the second sentence of Section 5(a) for purposes of that section only, the time of creation of nonvested property interests and powers of appointment is determined under general principles of property
                        law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since a will becomes effective as a dispositive instrument upon the decedent's death, not upon the execution of the will, general principles of property law determine that the time when a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by
                        will is created is at the decedent's death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With respect to a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by inter vivos transfer, the time when the interest or power is created is the date the transfer becomes effective for purposes of property law generally, normally the date
                        of delivery of the deed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With respect to a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by the testamentary or inter vivos exercise of a power of appointment, general principles of property law adopt the "relation back" doctrine. Under that doctrine, the appointed
                        interests or powers are created when the power was
                        <i>
        created
       </i> not when it was exercised, if the exercised power was a nongeneral power or a general testamentary power. If the exercised power was a general power presently exercisable, the relation back doctrine is not followed;
                        the time of creation of the appointed property interests or appointed powers is regarded as the time when the power was irrevocably
                        <i>
        exercised
       </i> , not when the power was created.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Subsection (b): Postponement, for Purposes of this Act, of the Time when a Nonvested Property Interest or a Power of Appointment is Created in Certain Cases
       </i> . The reason that the significant date for purposes of this Act is the date of creation is that the unilateral control of the interest (or the interest subject to the power) by one person is then relinquished. In certain
                        cases, all beneficial rights in a property interest (including an interest subject to a power of appointment) remain under the unilateral control of one person even after the delivery of the deed or even after the decedent's death.
                        In such cases, under this subsection, the interest or power is created, for purposes of this Act, when no person, acting alone, has a power presently exercisable to become the unqualified beneficial owner of the property interest
                        (or the property interest subject to the power of appointment).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Example (1) - Revocable Inter-Vivos Trust Case
       </i> . G conveyed property to a trustee, directing the trustee to pay the net income therefrom to himself (G) for life, then to G's son A for his life, then to A's children for the life of the survivor of A's children who
                        are living at G's death, and upon the death of such last surviving child, the corpus of the trust is to be distributed among A's then-living descendants, per stirpes. G retained the power to revoke the trust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of G's reservation of the power to revoke the trust, the creation for purposes of this Act of the nonvested property interests in this case occurs at G's death, not when the trust was established. This is in accordance with common law, for purposes
                        of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities. Cook v. Horn, 214 Ga. 289, 104 S.E.2d 461 (1958).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rationale that justifies the postponement of the time of creation in such cases is as follows. A person, such as G in the above example, who alone can exercise a power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of a nonvested property interest is
                        in effect the owner of that property interest. Thus, any nonvested property interest subject to such a power is not created for purposes of this Act until the power terminates (by release, expiration at the death of the donee,
                        or otherwise). Similarly, as noted above, any property interest or power of appointment created in an appointee by the irrevocable exercise of such a power is created at the time of the donee's irrevocable exercise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the power need not be a power to revoke, and it need not be held by the settlor or transferor. A
                        <i>
        presently exercisable
       </i> power held by
                        <i>
        any
       </i> person
                        <i>
        acting alone
       </i> to make himself the unqualified beneficial owner of the nonvested property interest or the property interest subject to a power of appointment is sufficient. If such a power exists, the time when the interest or power
                        is created, for purposes of this Act, is postponed until the termination of the power (by irrevocable exercise, release, contract to exercise or not to exercise, expiration at the death of the donee, or otherwise). An example of
                        such a power that might not be held by the settlor or transferor is a power, held by any person who can act alone, fully to invade the corpus of a trust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An important consequence of the idea that a power need not be held by the settlor for the time of creation to be postponed under this section is that it makes postponement possible even in cases of testamentary transfers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Example (2) - Testamentary Trust Case
       </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, remainder to such persons (including A, his creditors, his estate, and the creditors of his estate) as A shall appoint; in default
                        of appointment, the property to remain in trust to pay the income to A's children for the life of the survivor, and upon the death of A's last surviving child, to pay the corpus to A's grandchildren." A survived G.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If A exercises his presently exercisable general power, any nonvested property interest or power of appointment created by A's appointment is created for purposes of this Act when the power is exercised. If A does not exercise the power, the nonvested
                        property interests in G's gift-in-default clause are created when A's power terminates (at A's death). In either case, the postponement is justified because the transaction is the equivalent of G's having devised the full remainder
                        interest (following A's income interest) to A and of A's having in turn transferred that interest in accordance with his exercise of the power or, in the event the power is not exercised, devised that interest at his death in accordance
                        with G's gift-in-default clause. Note, however, that if G had conferred on A a
                        <i>
        nongeneral
       </i> power or a general
                        <i>
        testamentary
       </i> power, A's power of appointment, any nonvested property interest or power of appointment created by A's appointment, if any, and the nonvested property interests in G's gift-in-default clause would be created at G's
                        death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Unqualified Beneficial Owner of the Nonvested Property Interest or the Property Interest Subject to a Power of Appointment
       </i> . For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the presently exercisable power must be one that entitles the donee of the power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of the
                        <i>
        nonvested property interest (or the property interest subject to a nongeneral power of appointment, a general testamentary power of appointment, or a general power of appointment not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent)
       </i> . This requirement was met in Example (2), above, because A could by appointing the remainder interest to himself become the unqualified beneficial owner of all the nonvested property interests in G's gift-in-default
                        clause. In Example (2) it is not revealed whether A, if he exercised the power in his own favor, also had the right as sole beneficiary of the trust to compel the termination of the trust and possess himself as unqualified beneficial
                        owner of the property that was the subject of the trust. Having the power to compel termination of the trust is not necessary. If, for example, the trust in Example (2) was a spendthrift trust or contained any other feature that
                        under the relevant local law (see Claflin v. Claflin, 149 Mass. 19, 20 N.E. 454 (1889); Restatement (Second) of Trusts
                        <span class="s3">
        §
       </span> 337 (1959)) would prevent A as sole beneficiary from compelling termination of the trust, A's presently exercisable general power over the remainder interest would still postpone the time of creation of the nonvested
                        property interests in G's gift-in-default clause because the power enables A to become the unqualified beneficial owner of such interests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, it is not necessary that the donee of the power have the power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of
                        <i>
        all beneficial
       </i> rights
                        <i>
        in the trust
       </i> . In Example (2), the property interests in G's gift-in-default clause are not created for purposes of this Act until A's power expires (or on A's appointment, until the power's exercise) even if someone other than
                        A was the income beneficiary of the trust.
                    </p>

                        <i>
        Presently Exercisable Power
       </i> . For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the power must be presently exercisable. A testamentary power does not qualify. A power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent does
                        not qualify. If the condition precedent later becomes satisfied, however, so that the power becomes presently exercisable, the interests or powers subject thereto are not created, for purposes of this Act, until the termination
                        of the power. The common-law decision of Fitzpatrick v. Mercantile Safe Deposit Co., 220 Md. 534, 155 A.2d 702 (1959), appears to be in accord with this proposition.

                        <i>
        Example (3) - General Power in Unborn Child Case
       </i> . G devised property "to A for life, then to A's first-born child for life, then to such persons, including A's first-born child or such child's estate or creditors, as A's first-born child shall appoint." There was
                        a further provision that in default of appointment, the trust would continue for the benefit of G's descendants. G was survived by his daughter (A), who was then childless. After G's death, A had a child, X. A then died, survived
                        by X.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As of G's death, the power of appointment in favor of A's first-born child and the property interests in G's gift-in-default clause would be regarded as having been created at G's death because the power in A's first-born child was then a general power
                        not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At X's birth, X's general power became presently exercisable and excluded from the Statutory Rule. X's power also qualifies as a power exercisable by one person alone to become the unqualified beneficial owner of the property interests in G's gift-in-default
                        clause. Consequently, the nonvested property interests in G's gift-in-default clause are not created, for purposes of this Act, until the termination of X's power. If X exercises his presently exercisable general power, before
                        or after A's death, the appointed interests or powers are created, for purposes of this Act, as of X's exercise of the power.

                        <i>
        Partial Powers
       </i> . For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the person must have a presently exercisable power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of the full nonvested property interest or the property
                        interest subject to a power of appointment described in Section 1(b) or 1(c). If, for example, the subject of the transfer was an undivided interest such as a one-third tenancy in common, the power qualifies even though it relates
                        only to the undivided one-third interest in the tenancy in common; it need not relate to the whole property. A power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of only part of the nonvested property interest or the property interest
                        subject to a power of appointment, however, does not postpone the time of creation of the interests or powers subject thereto, unless the power is actually exercised.

                        <i>
        Example (4) - "5 and 5" Power Case
       </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, remainder to such persons (including A, his creditors, his estate, and the creditors of his estate) as A shall by will appoint;"
                        in default of appointment, the governing instrument provided for the property to continue in trust. A was given a noncumulative power to withdraw the greater of $5,000 or 5% of the corpus of the trust annually. A survived G. A
                        never exercised his noncumulative power of withdrawal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        G's death marks the time of creation of: A's testamentary power of appointment; any nonvested property interest or power of appointment created in G's gift-in-default clause; and any appointed interest or power created by a testamentary exercise of A's
                        power of appointment over the remainder interest. A's general power of appointment over the remainder interest does not postpone the time of creation because it is not a presently exercisable power. A's noncumulative power to withdraw
                        a portion of the trust each year does not postpone the time of creation as to all or the portion of the trust with respect to which A allowed his power to lapse each year because A's power is a power over only part of any nonvested
                        property interest or property interest subject to a power of appointment in G's gift-in-default clause and over only part of any appointed interest or power created by a testamentary exercise of A's general power of appointment
                        over the remainder interest. The same conclusion has been reached at common law. See Ryan v. Ward, 192 Md. 342, 64 A.2d 258 (1949).

                    <p>
                        If, however, in any year A exercised his noncumulative power of withdrawal in a way that created a nonvested property interest (or power of appointment) in the withdrawn amount (for example, if A directed the trustee to transfer the amount withdrawn directly
                        into a trust created by A), the appointed interests (or powers) would be created when the power was exercised, not when G died.

                        <i>
        Incapacity of the Donee of the Power
       </i> . The fact that the donee of a power lacks the capacity to exercise it, by reason of minority, mental incompetency, or any other reason, does not prevent the power held by such person from postponing the time of creation
                        under subsection (b), unless the governing instrument extinguishes the power (or prevents it from coming into existence) for that reason.

        Joint Powers - Community Property; Marital Property

                        a joint power over community property or over marital property under the Uniform Marital Property Act held by individuals married to each other is, for purposes of this Act, treated as a power exercisable by one person acting alone.

        Subsection (c): No Staggered Periods
       </i> . For purposes of this Act, subsection (c) in effect treats a transfer of property to a previously funded trust or other existing property arrangement as having been made when the nonvested property interest or power
                        of appointment in the original contribution was created. The purpose of subsection (c) is to avoid the administrative difficulties that would otherwise result where subsequent transfers are made to an existing irrevocable trust.
                        Without subsection (c), the allowable period under the Statutory Rule would be marked off in such cases from different times with respect to different portions of the same trust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Example (5) - Series of Transfers Case
       </i> . In Year One, G created an irrevocable inter vivos trust, funding it with $20,000 cash. In Year Five, when the value of the investments in which the original $20,000 contribution was placed had risen to a value of
                        $30,000, G added $10,000 cash to the trust. G died in Year Ten. G's will poured the residuary of his estate into the trust. G's residuary estate consisted of Blackacre (worth $20,000) and securities (worth $80,000). At G's death,
                        the value of the investments in which the original $20,000 contribution and the subsequent $10,000 contribution were placed had risen to a value of $50,000.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Were it not for subsection (c), the permissible vesting period under the Statutory Rule would be marked off from three different times: Year One, Year Five, and Year Ten. The effect of subsection (c) is that the permissible vesting period under the Statutory
                        Rule starts running only once - in Year One - with respect to the entire trust. This result is defensible not only to prevent the administrative difficulties inherent in recognizing staggered periods. It also is defensible because
                        if G's inter vivos trust had contained a perpetuity saving clause, the perpetuity-period component of the clause would be geared to the time when the original contribution to the trust was made; this clause would cover the subsequent
                        contributions as well. Since the major justification for the adoption by this Act of the wait-and-see method of perpetuity reform is that it amounts to a statutory insertion of a saving clause (see the Prefatory Note), subsection
                        (c) is consistent with the theory of this Act.

                        <i>
        Reformation
       </i> . This section requires a court, upon the petition of an interested person, to reform a disposition
                        <i>
        whose validity is governed by the wait-and-see element of Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2)
       </i> so that the reformed disposition is within the limits of the 90-year period allowed by those subsections, in the manner deemed by the court most closely to approximate the transferor's manifested plan of distribution,
                        in three circumstances: First, when (after the application of the Statutory Rule) a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment becomes invalid under the Statutory Rule; second, when a class gift has not but still might
                        become invalid under the Statutory Rule and the time has arrived when the share of one or more class members is to take effect in possession or enjoyment; and third, when a nonvested property interest can vest, but cannot do so
                        within the allowable 90-year period under the Statutory Rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is anticipated that the circumstances requisite to reformation will seldom arise, and consequently that this section will be applied infrequently. If, however, one of the three circumstances arises, the court in reforming is authorized to alter existing
                        interests or powers and to create new interests or powers by implication or construction based on the transferor's manifested plan of distribution as a whole. In reforming, the court is urged not to invalidate any vested interest
                        retroactively (the doctrine of infectious invalidity having been superseded by this Act, as indicated in the Comment to Section 1). The court is also urged not to reduce an age contingency in excess of 21 unless it is absolutely
                        necessary, and if it is deemed necessary to reduce such an age contingency, not to reduce it automatically to 21 but rather to reduce it no lower than absolutely necessary. See Example (3), below; Waggoner,

        Judicial Sale of Land Affected by Future Interests
       </i> . Although this section - except for cases that fall under subsections (2) or (3) - defers the time when a court is directed to reform a disposition until the expiration of the 90-year permissible vesting period, this
                        section is not to be understood as preventing an earlier application of other remedies. In particular, in the case of interests in land not in trust, the principle, codified in many states, is widely recognized that there is judicial
                        authority, under specified circumstances, to order a sale of land in which there are future interests. See 1 American Law of Property

                        the expiration of the 90-year permissible vesting period.

                        <i>
        Duration of the Indestructibility of Trusts - Termination of Trusts by Beneficiaries
       </i> . As noted in Part G of the Comment to Section 1, it is generally accepted that a trust cannot remain indestructible beyond the period of the rule against perpetuities. Under this Act, the period of the rule against
                        perpetuities applicable to a trust whose validity is governed by the wait-and-see element of Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2) is 90 years. The result of any reformation under Section 3 is that all nonvested property interests
                        in the trust will vest in interest (or terminate) no later than the 90th anniversary of their creation. In the case of trusts containing a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment whose validity is governed by Section
                        1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2), courts can therefore be expected to adopt the rule that no purpose of the settlor, expressed in or implied from the governing instrument, can prevent the beneficiaries of a trust other than a charitable
                        trust from compelling its termination after 90 years after every nonvested property interest and power of appointment in the trust was created.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Subsection (1): Invalid Property Interest or Power of Appointment
       </i> . Subsection (1) is illustrated by the following examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Example (1) - Multiple Generation Trust
       </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then to A's children for the life of the survivor, then to A's grandchildren for the life of the survivor, and on the death of A's
                        last surviving grandchild, the corpus of the trust is to be divided among A's then living descendants per stirpes; if none, to" a specified charity. G was survived by his child (A) and by A's two minor children (X and Y). After
                        G's death, another child (Z) was born to A. Subsequently, A died, survived by his children (X, Y, and Z) and by three grandchildren (M, N, and O).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are four interests subject to the Statutory Rule in this example: (1) the income interest in favor of A's children, (2) the income interest in favor of A's grandchildren, (3) the remainder interest in the corpus in favor of A's descendants who survive
                        the death of A's last surviving grandchild, and (4) the alternative remainder interest in the corpus in favor of the specified charity. The first interest is initially valid under Section 1(a)(1); A is the validating life for that
                        interest. There is no validating life for the other three interests, and so their validity is governed by Section 1(a)(2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, as is likely, A and A's children all die before the 90th anniversary of G's death, the income interest in favor of A's grandchildren is valid under Section 1(a)(2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, as is also likely, some of A's grandchildren are alive on the 90th anniversary of G's death, the alternative remainder interests in the corpus of the trust then become invalid under Section 1(a)(2), giving rise to Section 3(1)'s prerequisite to reformation.
                        A court would be justified in reforming G's disposition by closing the class in favor of A's descendants as of the 90th anniversary of G's death (precluding new entrants thereafter), by moving back the condition of survivorship
                        on the class so that the remainder interest is in favor of G's descendants who survive the 90th anniversary of G's death (rather than in favor of those who survive the death of A's last surviving grandchild), and by redefining
                        the class so that its makeup is formed as if A's last surviving grandchild died on the 90th anniversary of G's death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Example (2) - Sub-Class Case
       </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then in equal shares to A's children for their respective lives; on the death of each child the proportionate share of corpus of
                        the one so dying shall go to the descendants of such child surviving at such child's death, per stirpes." G was survived by A and by A's two children (X and Y). After G's death, another child (Z) was born to A. Subsequently, A
                        died, survived by X, Y, and Z.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the sub-class doctrine, each remainder interest in favor of the descendants of a child of A is treated separately from the others. Consequently, the remainder interest in favor of X's descendants and the remainder interest in favor of Y's descendants
                        are valid under Section 1(a)(1): X is the validating life for the one, and Y is the validating life for the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The remainder interest in favor of the descendants of Z is not validated by Section 1(a)(1) because Z, who was not alive when the interest was created, could have descendants more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, X, and Y. Instead,
                        the validity of the remainder interest in favor of Z's descendants is governed by Section 1(a)(2), under which its validity depends on Z's dying within 90 years after G's death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although unlikely, suppose that Z is still living 90 years after G's death. The remainder interest in favor of Z's descendants will then become invalid under the Statutory Rule, giving rise to subsection (1)'s prerequisite to reformation. In such circumstances,
                        a court would be justified in reforming the remainder interest in favor of Z's descendants by making it indefeasibly vested as of the 90th anniversary of G's death. To do this, the court would reform the disposition by eliminating
                        the condition of survivorship of Z and closing the class to new entrants after the 90th anniversary of G's death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Subsection (2): Class Gifts Not Yet Invalid
       </i> . Subsection (2), which, upon the petition of an interested person, requires reformation in certain cases where a class gift has not but still might become invalid under the Statutory Rule, is illustrated by the following
                        examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Example (3) - Age Contingency in Excess of 21
       </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then to A's children; the corpus of the trust is to be equally divided among A's children who reach the age of 30." G was survived
                        by A, by A's spouse (H), and by A's two children (X and Y), both of whom were under the age of 30 when G died.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the remainder interest in favor of A's children who reach 30 is a class gift, at common law (Leake v. Robinson, 2 Mer. 363, 35 Eng. Rep. 979 (Ch. 1817)) and under this Act (see Part G of the Comment to Section 1) the interests of
                        <i>
        all
       </i> potential class members must be valid or the class gift is totally invalid. Although X and Y will either reach 30 or die under 30 within their own lifetimes, there is at G's death the possibility that A will have an
                        afterborn child (Z) who will reach 30 or die under 30 more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, H, X, and Y. There is no validating life, and the class gift is therefore not validated by Section 1(a)(1).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under Section 1(a)(2), the children's remainder interest becomes invalid only if an interest of a class member neither vests nor terminates within 90 years after G's death. If in fact there is an afterborn child (Z), and if upon A's death, Z has at least
                        reached an age such that he cannot be alive and under the age of 30 on the 90th anniversary of G's death, the class gift is valid. (Note that at Z's
                        <i>
        birth
       </i> it would have been known whether or not Z could be alive and under the age of 30 on the 90th anniversary of G's death; nevertheless, even if it was
                        <i>
        then
       </i> certain that
                        <i>
        Z
       </i> could
                        <i>
        not
       </i> be alive and under the age of 30 on the 90th anniversary of G's death, the class gift could not
                        <i>
        then
       </i> have been declared valid because, A being alive, it was
                        <i>
        then
       </i> possible for one or more additional children to have later been born to or adopted by A.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although unlikely, suppose that at A's death (prior to the expiration of the 90-year period), Z's age was such that he
                        <i>
        could
       </i> be alive and under the age of 30 on the 90th anniversary of G's death. Suppose further that at A's death X and Y were over the age of 30. Z's interest and hence the class gift as a whole is not yet invalid under the
                        Statutory Rule because Z might die under the age of 30 within the remaining part of the 90-year period following G's death; but the class gift might become invalid because Z might be alive and under the age of 30, 90 years after
                        G's death. Consequently, the prerequisites to reformation set forth in subsection (2) are satisfied, and a court would be justified in reforming G's disposition to provide that Z's interest is contingent on reaching the age he
                        can reach if he lives to the 90th anniversary of G's death. This would render Z's interest valid so far as the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities is concerned, and allow the class gift as a whole to be declared valid. X and Y
                        would thus be entitled immediately to their one-third shares each. If Z's interest later vested, Z would receive the remaining one-third share. If Z failed to reach the required age under the reformed disposition, the remaining
                        one-third share would be divided equally between X and Y or their successors in interest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Example (4) - Case Where Subsection (2) Applies, Not Involving an Age Contingency in Excess of 21
       </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then to A's children; the corpus of the trust is to be equally divided among A's children who graduate from an accredited medical
                        school or law school." G was survived by A, by A's spouse (H), and by A's two minor children (X and Y).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As in Example (3), the remainder interest in favor of A's children is a class gift, and the common-law principle is not superseded by this Act by which the interests of
                        <i>
        all
       </i> potential class members must be valid or the class gift is totally invalid. Although X and Y will either graduate from an accredited medical or law school, or fail to do so, within their own lifetimes, there is at G's
                        death the possibility that A will have an after-born child (Z), who will graduate from an accredited medical or law school (or die without having done either) more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, H, X, and Y.
                        The class gift would not be valid under the Common-law Rule and is, therefore, not validated by Section 1(a)(1).

                        Under Section 1(a)(2), the children's remainder interest becomes invalid only if an interest of a class member neither vests nor terminates within 90 years after G's death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suppose in fact that there is an afterborn child (Z), and that at A's death Z was a freshman in college. Suppose further that at A's death X had graduated from an accredited law school and that Y had graduated from an accredited medical school. Z's interest
                        and hence the class gift as a whole is not yet invalid under Section 1(a)(2) because the 90-year period following G's death has not yet expired; but the class gift might become invalid because Z might be alive but not a graduate
                        of an accredited medical or law school 90 years after G's death. Consequently, the prerequisites to reformation set forth in Section 3(2) are satisfied, and a court would be justified in reforming G's disposition to provide that
                        Z's interest is contingent on graduating from an accredited medical or law school within 90 years after G's death. This would render Z's interest valid so far as the Section 1(a)(2) is concerned and allow the class gift as a whole
                        to be declared valid. X and Y would thus be entitled immediately to their one-third shares each. If Z's interest later vested, Z would receive the remaining one-third share. If Z failed to graduate from an accredited medical or
                        law school within the allowed time under the disposition as so reformed, the remaining one-third share would be divided equally between X and Y or their successors in interest.

        Subsection (3): Interests that Can Vest But Not Within the 90-Year Permissible Vesting Period
       </i> . In exceedingly rare cases, an interest might be created that can vest, but not within the 90-year permissible vesting period of the Statutory Rule. This may be the situation when the interest was created (See Example
                        (5)), or it may become the situation at some time thereafter (see Example (6)). Whenever the situation occurs, the court, upon the petition of an interested person, is required by subsection (3) to reform the disposition within
                        the limits of the 90-year permissible vesting period.
                    </p>

                        <i>
        Example (5) - Case of an Interest, as of its Creation, being Impossible to Vest Within the 90-Year Period
       </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to divide the income, per stirpes, among G's descendants from time to time living, for 100 years. At the end of the 100-year period following G's death, the trustee
                        is to distribute the corpus and accumulated income to G's then-living descendants, per stirpes; if none, to the XYZ Charity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nonvested property interest in favor of G's descendants who are living 100 years after G's death can vest, but not within the 90-year period of Section 1(a)(2). The interest would violate the Common-law Rule, and hence is not validated by Section
                        1(a)(1), because there is no validating life. In these circumstances, a court is required by Section 3(3) to reform G's disposition within the limits of the 90-year period. An appropriate result would be for the court to lower
                        the period following G's death from a 100-year period to a 90-year period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that the circumstance that triggers the direction to reform the disposition under this subsection is that the nonvested property interest still can vest, but cannot vest within the 90-year period of Section 1(a)(2). It is not necessary that the interest
                        be certain to become
                        <i>
        invalid
       </i> under that subsection. For the interest to be certain to become invalid under Section 1(a)(2), it would have to be certain that it can neither vest
                        <i>
        nor terminate
       </i> within the 90-year period. In this example, the interest of G's descendants might
                        <i>
        terminate
       </i> within the period (by all of G's descendants dying within 90 years of G's death). If this were to happen, the interest of XYZ Charity would be valid because it would have vested within the allowable period. However,
                        it was thought desirable to require reformation without waiting to see if this would happen: The only way that G's
                        <i>
        descendants
       </i> , who are G's
                        <i>
        primary
       </i> set of beneficiaries, would have a chance to take the property is to reform the disposition within the limits of the 90-year period on the ground that their interest cannot
                        <i>
        vest
       </i> within the allowable period and subsection (3) so provides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Example (6) - Case of an Interest after its Creation Becoming Impossible to Vest Within the 90-Year Period
       </i> . G devised property in trust, with the income to be paid to A. The corpus of the trust was to be divided among A's children who reach 30, each child's share to be paid on the child's 30th birthday; if none reaches
                        30, to the XYZ Charity. G was survived by A and by A's two children (X and Y). Neither X nor Y had reached 30 at G's death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The class gift in favor of A's children who reach 30 would violate the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities and, thus, is not validated by Section 1(a)(1). Its validity is therefore governed by Section 1(a)(2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suppose that after G's death, and during A's lifetime, X and Y die and a third child (Z) is born to or adopted by A. At A's death, Z is living but her age is such that she cannot reach 30 within the remaining part of the 90-year period following G's death.
                        As of A's death, it has become the situation that Z's interest cannot vest within the allowable period. The circumstances requisite to reformation under subsection (3) have arisen. An appropriate result would be for the court to
                        lower the age contingency to the age Z can reach 90 years after G's death.

                    <p>
                        Section 4 lists seven exclusions from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (Statutory Rule). Some are declaratory of existing law; others are contrary to existing law. Since the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is superseded by this Act (or a statutory
                        version or variation thereof is repealed by this Act), a nonvested property interest, power of appointment, or other arrangement excluded from the Statutory Rule by this section is not subject to any rule against perpetuities,
                        statutory or otherwise.

                        <i>
        Rationale
       </i> . In line with long-standing scholarly commentary, subsection (1) excludes (with certain enumerated exceptions) nonvested property interests and powers of appointment arising out of a nondonative transfer. The rationale
                        for this exclusion is that the Rule Against Perpetuities is a wholly inappropriate instrument of social policy to use as a control over such arrangements. The period of the rule - a life in being plus 21 years - is not suitable
                        for nondonative transfers, and this point applies with equal force to the 90-year allowable waiting period under the wait-and-see element of Section 1 because that period represents an approximation of the period of time that would
                        be produced, on average, by using a statutory list identifying actual measuring lives and adding a 21-year period following the death of the survivor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No general exclusion from the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is recognized for nondonative transfers, and so subsection (1) is contrary to existing common law. (But see Metropolitan Transportation Authority v. Bruken Realty Corp., 67 N.Y.2d 156,
                        492 N.E.2d 379, 384 (1986), pointing out the inappropriateness of the period of a life in being plus 21 years to cases of commercial and governmental transactions and noting that the Rule Against Perpetuities can invalidate legitimate
                        transactions in such cases.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (1) is therefore inconsistent with decisions holding the Common-law Rule to be applicable to the following types of property interests or arrangements when created in a nondonative, commercial-type transaction, as they almost always are: options
                        (e.g., Milner v. Bivens, 335 S.E.2d 288 (Ga. 1985)); preemptive rights in the nature of a right of first refusal (e.g., Atchison v. City of Englewood, 170 Colo. 295, 463 P.2d 297 (1969); Robroy Land Co., Inc. v. Prather, 24 Wash.
                        App. 511, 601 P.2d 297 (1969)); leases to commence in the future, at a time certain or on the happening of a future event such as the completion of a building (e.g., Southern Airways Co. v. DeKalb County, 101 Ga. App. 689, 115
                        S.E.2d 207 (1960)); nonvested easements; top leases and top deeds with respect to interests in minerals (e.g., Peveto v. Starkey, 645 S.W.2d 770 (Tex. 1982)); and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Consideration Does Not Necessarily Make the Transfer Nondonative
       </i> . A transfer can be supported by consideration and still be donative in character and hence not excluded from the Statutory Rule. A transaction that is essentially gratuitous in nature, accompanied by donative intent
                        on the part of at least one party to the transaction, is not to be regarded as nondonative simply because it is for consideration. Thus, for example, the exclusion would not apply if a parent purchases a parcel of land for full
                        and adequate consideration, and directs the seller to make out the deed in favor of the purchaser's daughter for life, remainder to such of the daughter's children as reach 25. The nonvested property interest of the daughter's
                        children is subject to the Statutory Rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Some Transactions Not Excluded Even if Considered Nondonative
       </i> . Some types of transactions - although in some sense supported by consideration and hence arguably nondonative - arise out of a domestic situation, and should not be excluded from the Statutory Rule. To avoid uncertainty
                        with respect to such transactions, subsection (1) specifies that nonvested property interests or powers of appointment arising out of any of the following transactions are not excluded by subsection (1)'s nondonative-transfers

        Other Means of Controlling Some Nondonative Transfers Desirable
       </i> . Some commercial transactions respecting land or mineral interests, such as options in gross (including rights of first refusal), leases to commence in the future, nonvested easements, and top leases and top deeds
                        in commercial use in the oil and gas industry, directly or indirectly restrain the alienability of property or provide a disincentive to improve the property. Although controlling the duration of such interests is desirable, they
                        are excluded by subsection (1) from the Statutory Rule because, as noted above, the period of a life in being plus 21 years - actual or by the 90-year proxy - is inappropriate for them; that period is appropriate for family-oriented,
                        donative transfers.

                    <p>
                        The Committee was aware that a few states have adopted statutes on perpetuities that include special limits on certain commercial transactions (e.g., Fla. Stat.

        §
       </span> 194(a)), and in fact the Committee itself drafted a comprehensive version of Section 4 that would have imposed a 40-year period-in-gross limitation in specified cases. In the end, however, the Committee did not present
                        that version to the National Conference for approval because it was of the opinion that the control of these interests is better left to other types of statutes, such as marketable title acts (e.g., the Uniform Simplification of
                        Land Transfers Act) and the Uniform Dormant Mineral Interests Act, backed up by the potential application of the common-law rules regarding unreasonable restraints on alienation.

        Subsection (2) - Administrative Fiduciary Powers
       </i> . Fiduciary powers are subject to the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, unless specifically excluded. Purely administrative fiduciary powers are excluded by subsections (2) and (3), but distributive fiduciary powers
                        are generally speaking not excluded. The only distributive fiduciary power excluded is the one described in subsection (4).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application of subsection (2) to fiduciary powers can be illustrated by the following example.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Example (1)
       </i> . G devised property in trust, directing the trustee (a bank) to pay the income to A for life, then to A's children for the life of the survivor, and on the death of A's last surviving child to pay the corpus to B.
                        The trustee is granted the discretionary power to sell and to reinvest the trust assets and to invade the corpus on behalf of the income beneficiary or beneficiaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trustee's fiduciary power to sell and reinvest the trust assets is a purely administrative power, and under subsection (2) of this section is not subject to the Statutory Rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trustee's fiduciary power to invade corpus, however, is a nongeneral power of appointment that is not excluded from the Statutory Rule. Its validity, and hence its exercisability, is governed by Section 1. Under that section, since the power is not
                        initially valid under Section 1(c)(1), Section 1(c)(2) applies and the power ceases to be exercisable 90 years after G's death.

                        representative, an executor, successor executor, or co-executor, etc.). Sometimes such a power is held by a fiduciary and sometimes not. In either case, the power is excluded from the Statutory Rule.

                        before the termination of a trust to a beneficiary who has an indefeasibly vested interest in the income and principal.

                        dies under 40, the child's share is to be paid to the child's estate as a property interest owned by such child. The trustee is given the discretionary power to advance all or a portion of a child's share before the child reaches
                        40. G was survived by A, who was then childless.

                        <i>
        duty

        Subsection (a): Act Not Retroactive
       </i> . This section provides that, except as provided in subsection (b), the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities and the other provisions of this Act apply only to nonvested property interests or powers of appointment created
                        on or after the Act's effective date. With one exception, in determining when a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment is created, the principles of Section 2 are applicable. Thus, for example, a property interest
                        (or a power of appointment) created in a revocable inter vivos trust is created when the power to revoke terminates. See Example (1) in the Comment to Section 2.

                        The second sentence of subsection (a) establishes a special rule for nonvested property interests (and powers of appointment) created by the exercise of a power of appointment. For purposes of this section only, a nonvested property interest (or a power
                        of appointment) created by the exercise of a power of appointment is created when the power is irrevocably exercised or when a revocable exercise of the power becomes irrevocable. Consequently, all the provisions of this Act except
                        Section 5(b) apply to a nonvested property interest (or power of appointment) created by a donee's exercise of a power of appointment where the donee's exercise, whether revocable or irrevocable, occurs on or after the effective
                        date of this Act. All the provisions of this Act except Section 5(b) also apply where the donee's exercise occurred before the effective date of this Act if: (i) that pre-effective-date exercise was revocable
                        <i>

       </i> (ii) that revocable exercise becomes irrevocable on or after the effective date of this Act. This special rule applies to the exercise of all types of powers of appointment - presently exercisable general powers, general
                        testamentary powers, and nongeneral powers.

                    <p>
                        If the application of this special rule determines that the provisions of this Act (except Section 5(b)) apply, then for all such purposes, the time of creation of the appointed nonvested property interest (or appointed power of appointment) is determined
                        by reference to Section 2, without regard to the special rule contained in the second sentence of Section 5(a).

                    <p>
                        If the application of this special rule of Section 5(a) determines that the provisions of this Act (except Section 5(b)) do not apply, then Section 5(b) is the only potentially applicable provision of this Act.

        Example (1) - Testamentary Power Created Before but Exercised After the Effective Date of this Act
       </i> . G was the donee of a general testamentary power of appointment created by the will of his mother, M. M died in 1980. Assume that the effective date of this Act in the jurisdiction is January 1, 1987. G died in 1988,
                        leaving a will that exercised his general testamentary power of appointment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the special rule in the second sentence of Section 5(a), any nonvested property interest (or power of appointment) created by G in his will in exercising his general testamentary power was created (for purposes of Section 5) at G's death in 1988,
                        which was
                        <i>
        after
       </i> the effective date of this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consequently, all the provisions of this Act apply (except Section 5(b)). That point having been settled, the next step is to determine whether the nonvested property interests or powers of appointment created by G's testamentary appointment are initially
                        valid under Section 1(a)(1), 1(b)(1), or 1(c)(1), or whether the wait-and-see element established in Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2) apply. If the wait-and-see element does apply, it must also be determined when the allowable
                        90-year waiting period starts to run. In making these determinations, the principles of Section 2 control the time of creation of the nonvested property interests (or powers of appointment); under Section 2, since G's power was
                        a general testamentary power of appointment, the common-law relation-back doctrine applies and the appointed nonvested property interests (and appointed powers of appointment) are created at M's death in 1980.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If G's testamentary power of appointment had been a nongeneral power rather than a general power, the same results as described above would apply.
                    </p>

        Example (2) - Presently Exercisable Nongeneral Power Created Before but Exercised After the Effective Date of this Act
       </i> . Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that G's power of appointment was a presently exercisable nongeneral power. If G exercised the power in 1988, after the effective date of this Act (or, if a pre-effective-date
                        revocable exercise of his power became irrevocable in 1988, after the effective date of this Act), the same results as described above in Example (1) would apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>
        Example (3) - Presently Exercisable General Power Created Before but Exercised After the Effective Date of this Act
       </i> . Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that G's power of appointment was a presently exercisable general power. If G exercised the power in 1988, after the effective date of this Act (or, if a pre-effective-date
                        revocable exercise of his power became irrevocable in 1988, after the effective date of this Act), all the provisions of this Act (except Section 5(b)) apply; for such purposes, Section 2 controls the date of creation of the appointed
                        nonvested property interests (or appointed powers of appointment), without regard to the special rule of the second sentence of Section 5(a). With respect to the exercise of a presently exercisable general power, it is possible
                        - indeed, probable - that the special rule of the second sentence of Section 5(a) and the rules of Section 2 agree on the same date of creation for their respective purposes, that date being the date the power was irrevocably exercised
                        (or a revocable exercise thereof became irrevocable).

        Subsection (b): Reformation of Pre-existing Instruments
       </i> . Although the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities and the other provisions of this Act do not apply retroactively, subsection (b) recognizes a court's authority to exercise its equitable power to reform instruments
                        that contain a violation of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities (or of a statutory version or variation thereof) and to which the Statutory Rule does not apply because the offending nonvested property interest or power of
                        appointment in question was created before the effective date of this Act. This equitable power to reform is recognized only where the violation of the former rule against perpetuities is determined in a judicial proceeding that
                        is commenced on or after the effective date of this Act. See below.

                        Without legislative authorization or direction, the courts in four states - Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and West Virginia - have held that they have the power to reform instruments that contain a violation of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities.

                        New Hampshire, and West Virginia decisions, however, invoked the court's equitable power (sometimes called the cy pres power, and sometimes called the doctrine of equitable approximation or equitable modification) to reform pre-existing
                        instruments that contained a violation of the Common-law Rule. Subsection (b) constitutes statutory authority for a court to exercise its equitable reformation power.

        Reformation Experience So Far
       </i> . The existing judicial opinions and legislative provisions purport to adopt a principle of reformation that is consistent with the theme that the technique of reform should be shaped to grant every appropriate opportunity
                        for the property to go to the intended beneficiaries. The New Hampshire court, for example, said that "where there is a general and a particular intent, and the particular one cannot take effect, the words shall be so construed
                        as to give effect to the general intent." Edgerly v. Barker, 66 N.H. 434, 467, 31 A. 900, 912 (1891) (citation omitted). The Hawaii court held that "any interest which would violate the Rule Against Perpetuities shall be reformed
                        within the limits of that rule to approximate most closely the intention of the creator of the interest."

        In re Estate of Chun Quan Yee Hop
       </i> , 52 Hawaii 40, 46, 469 P.2d 183, 187 (1970). The Mississippi court described the reformation principle as "a simple rule of judicial construction, designed to aid the court to ascertain and carry out, as nearly as
                        may be, the intention of the donor." Carter v. Berry, 243 Miss. 321, 370, 140 So.2d 843, 852 (1962). The California statute provides that the authority to reform "shall be liberally construed and applied to validate [the] interest
                        to the fullest extent consistent with [the] ascertained intent." Cal. Civ. Code

                        Unfortunately, all the cases that have arisen so far have been of one general type - contingencies in excess of 21 years - and all of the courts have simply ordered a reduction of the age or period in gross to 21.

        Guidance as to How to Reform
       </i> . The above reformation efforts are unduly narrow. Subsection (b) is to be understood as authorizing a more appropriate technique - judicial insertion of a saving clause into the instrument. See Browder,
                        <i>
        Construction, Reformation, and the Rule Against Perpetuities
       </i> , 62 Mich.L.Rev. 1 (1963); Waggoner,
                        <i>
        Perpetuity Reform
       </i> , 81 Mich.L.Rev. 1718, 1755-1759 (1983); Langbein &amp; Waggoner,

        Reformation of Wills on the Ground of Mistake: Change of Direction in American Law?
       </i> , 130 U.Pa.L.Rev. 521, 546-49 (1982). This method of reformation allows reformation to achieve an after-the-fact duplication of a professionally competent product. Such a technique would have been especially suitable
                        in the cases that have already arisen, for it probably would have allowed the dispositions in all of them to have been rendered valid without disturbing the transferor's intent at all. See Waggoner,
                        <i>
        Perpetuity Reform
       </i> , 81 Mich.L.Rev. 1718, 1756 n. 103 (1983). The insertion of a saving clause grants a more appropriate opportunity for the property to go to the intended beneficiaries. Furthermore, it would also be a suitable technique
                        in fertile octogenarian, unborn widow, and administrative contingency cases. A saving clause is one of the formalistic devices that a professionally competent lawyer would have used before the fact to assure initial validity in
                        these cases. Insofar as other violations are concerned, the saving clause technique also grants every appropriate opportunity for the property to go to the intended beneficiaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In selecting the lives to be used for the perpetuity-period component of the saving clause that in a given case is to be inserted after the fact, the principle to be adopted is the same one that ought to guide lawyers in drafting such a clause before
                        the fact: The group selected should be appropriate to the facts and the disposition. While the exact make-up of the group in each case would be settled by litigation, the individuals designated in Section 1.3(2) of the Restatement
                        (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers) (1983) as the measuring lives would be an appropriate referent for the court to consider. Care should be taken in formulating the gift-over component, so that it is appropriate to the dispositive
                        scheme. Among possible recipients that the court might consider designating are: (i) the persons entitled to the income on the 21st anniversary of the death of the last surviving individual designated by the court for the perpetuity-period
                        component and in the proportions thereof to which they are then so entitled; if no proportions are specified, in equal shares to the permissible recipients of income; or (ii) the grantor's descendants per stirpes who are living
                        21 years after the death of the last surviving individual designated by the court for the perpetuity-period component; if none, to the grantor's heirs at law determined as if the grantor died 21 years after the death of the last
                        surviving individual designated in the perpetuity-period component.

        Violation Must be Determined in a Judicial Proceeding Commenced On or After the Effective Date of this Act

                        date of this Act. The equitable power to reform would typically be exercised in the same judicial proceeding in which the invalidity is determined.

                        to replace the common law rule against perpetuities with the statutory provisions as to the types of transfers not excluded from the USRAP; because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a02s41-18" target="_self">G.S. 41-18</a></cite>                        clearly provided that the USRAP did not apply to nonvested property rights arising from non donative transfers such as the commercial lease, there was nothing to supersede the common law rule against perpetuities, and the USRAP
                        did not apply. New Bar P'ship v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 729 S.E.2d 675 (2012).

                        power. In the case of other powers, the permissible period is computed from the time the power is created, but facts at the time the power is exercised shall be considered in determining whether the power of alienation is suspended

      COMMENTARY
     </b>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Article 3 is based upon a proposed Uniform Act that is under consideration by the Joint Editorial Board for the Uniform Probate Code. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a03s41-28" target="_self">G.S. 41-28</a></cite> and 41-33 have no counterpart
                in the proposed Uniform Act.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following comments were prepared to accompany the proposed Uniform Act. The drafters of the North Carolina Act believe that these comments provide a useful guide to the Act. Minor changes have been made to correspond to the North Carolina Act.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some transactions respecting land, such as options in gross (including rights of first refusal), leases to commence in the future, and nonvested easements, directly or indirectly restrain the alienability of property or provide a disincentive to improve
                the property.
            </p>
            <p>
                Article 3 contains sections that generally impose a 30-year time limit on such interests. To prevent an overlap with Article 2 of this Chapter, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a02s41-18" target="_self">G.S. 41-18(9)</a></cite> excludes
                such interests from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities. (Many but not all such interests are also excluded by other subdivisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a02s41-18" target="_self">G.S. 41-18</a></cite>.) The 90-year permissible
                vesting period of the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities is an inappropriate limit on these interests. As an approximation of the period of a life in being plus 21 years, the 90-year period is an appropriate limit on interests arising
                out of family-oriented donative transfers. A shorter period is a more appropriate limit on the interests covered in Article 3, whether those interests arise out of a donative or a nondonative transfer.

                <p>
                    An option in gross with respect to an interest in land or a preemptive right in the nature of a right of first refusal in gross with respect to an interest in land becomes invalid if it is not actually exercised within 30 years after its creation. For
                    purposes of this section, the term "interest in land" does not include arrangements relating solely to an interest in oil, gas, or minerals.

                        This section imposes a 30-year time limit on the duration of options in gross and preemptive rights in gross with respect to an interest in land. The appellation "in gross" refers to the fact that the optionee or preemptioner has no possessory interest
                        in the property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If an option or preemptive right pertains to an interest in land, the option or preemptive right becomes invalid if it remains unexercised 30 years after its creation.

    Example.
   </i> A, the owner of Blackacre, sells an option to B under which A obligates himself, his heirs, and assigns at any time in the future to convey Blackacre to B, his heirs, and assigns for $X.00. Or, A, the owner of Blackacre,
                        sells Blackacre to B. As part of the transaction, B obligates himself, his heirs, and assigns at any time in the future to reconvey Blackacre to A, his heirs, and assigns for $X.00. If either option remains unexercised 30 years
                        after its creation, it ceases to be valid. (Both options are excluded from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a02s41-18" target="_self">G.S. 41-18(1)</a></cite> and (9).)

        Options Held by a Lessee Not Affected by this Section.
       </i> This section does not apply to an option or right of first refusal (preemptive right) that is not in gross. Thus, this section does not apply to an option or preemptive right held by a lessee to renew, extend, or enter
                        into a new lease of or to purchase the leased premises. Such options or rights of first refusal do not deter the lessee from making improvements on the property, and so public policy is not viewed as requiring controls on their

                    A lease to commence at a time certain or upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a future event becomes invalid if its term does not actually commence in possession within 30 years after its execution. For purposes of this section, the term "lease" does

                        Such leases are excluded from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a02s41-18" target="_self">G.S. 41-18(1)</a></cite> and (9). Excluding such leases from the Rule Against Perpetuities removes
                        a source of considerable litigation under the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities concerning the validity of so-called "on completion" leases - leases to commence on the completion of a building.

                    <p>
                        Such leases would be clearly valid at common law if the lessor was obligated to complete the building within 21 years, but in the absence of an explicit obligation of this sort, some courts have held the lease to be invalid. E.g., Southern Airways Co.
                        v. DeKalb County, 101 Ga. App. 689, 115 S.E.2d 207 (1960); others, though, have upheld such leases on the theory that the lessee's interest was vested from the beginning (Isen v. Giant Food, Inc., 295 F.2d 136 (D.C. Cir. 1960));
                        or that there was an implicit obligation to complete the building within a reasonable time (Wong v. DiGrazia, 60 Cal.2d 525, 386 P.2d 817 (1963); Singer Co. v. Makad, Inc., 213 Kan. 725, 518 P.2d 493 (1974); see also Read v. GHDC,
                        Inc., 334 S.E.2d 165 (Ga. 1985); Ryland Group, Inc. v. Wills, 331 S.E.2d 399 (Va. 1985)).

                    <p>
                        Although the risk under the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities that such leases would be declared invalid from the beginning would be removed by the wait-and-see feature of the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, such leases are excluded from the Statutory
                        Rule entirely. A shorter period than the 90 years allowed by the Statutory Rule is more appropriate to commercial transactions that impinge upon the marketability of land, and the 30-year period selected should give reasonable
                        time for such leases to commence in possession.

                        This section places a 30-year limit on the time during which a nonvested easement in gross can remain nonvested. An easement is nonvested if the right of utilization is subject to a condition precedent, i.e., if the right of utilization is conditioned
                        upon the happening of a specified future event. An easement is in gross if it has a servient estate but no dominant estate; an easement in gross is a personal interest in the land of another. The difficulty of locating the owner
                        of a nonvested easement in gross as time goes along is the principal reason for limiting to 30 years the time during which the easement can remain nonvested.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether or not an easement is vested depends on whether the holder has the current right to utilize it. Thus, an easement can be vested even if the holder has not actually utilized it. If, however, the easement holder has actually utilized the easement,
                        the easement is vested by definition. For example, an easement to transmit electric power across land from a power plant would be vested, if it had not previously vested, when the holder of the easement commenced to install power
                        transmission lines on the land; vesting would not be delayed until power is actually transmitted through those lines.

                    <p>
                        This section does not limit the duration of a vested easement, nor does it affect an easement that is vested subject to a defeasance clause that may cause it to terminate. Nor does this section affect multiple floating easements, which are also called
                        single expansible easements with multiple potential routes, because they are vested. E.g., Kleinheider v. Phillips Pipe Line Co., 528 F.2d 837, 843-44 (8th Cir. 1975).

                        This reverses the rule at common law, under which nonvested easements were subjected to the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities and rendered invalid ab initio if they were not certain to vest or terminate within a life in being

                        With certain exceptions, this section imposes a 60-year time limit on the duration of certain possibilities of reverter, rights of entry (also known as rights of re-entry, rights of entry for condition broken, and powers of termination), and executory

                        Possibilities of reverter and rights of entry are generally exempt from the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities. But their nonreversionary counterpart - the executory interest that follows either a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to an
                        executory limitation - is subject to the common-law Rule. By statute in some states, possibilities of reverter and rights of entry expire if they do not vest within a specified period of years (such as 30 or 40 years). These statutes,
                        however, do not apply to the type of executory interest described above, which is the nonreversionary counterpart of the possibility of reverter and/or right of entry.

                        and take possession of the premises."

                        Against Perpetuities. In Alternative 2, A has a fee simple subject to an executory limitation; B has an executory interest that is excluded from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities.

    Event or Events Affecting the Use of Land.

                        of land. The purpose of this restriction is to exempt family-oriented dispositions from the 60-year time limit in cases where the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities is a more appropriate measure for controlling the interest.

                        Although B has an executory interest preceded by a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, B's executory interest is not controlled by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a03s41-32" target="_self">G.S. 41-32</a></cite> because
                        the event on which its vesting depends does not relate to the use of land. Instead, B's executory interest is governed by the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, under which it is valid from creation because it complies with
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a02s41-15ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 41-15(a)(1)</a></cite>.

                        The phrase "event or events affecting the use of land" is to be given an interpretation appropriate to its purpose. Thus, a devise to a church "so long as the church shall maintain and promulgate its present religious belief and faith and continue as
                        a church" is not a family-oriented disposition and should be found to describe an event affecting the use of the land.

    Exception for Certain Charitable and Governmental Interest.
   </i> The last sentence of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41a03s41-32" target="_self">G.S. 41-32</a></cite> exempts certain interests held by a charity, a government, or governmental agency or subdivision from the 60-year time

                        that a nonvested property interest held by a charity, a government, or a governmental agency or subdivision is excluded from the Rule Against Perpetuities if the interest was preceded by an interest held by another charity, government,
                        or governmental agency or subdivision.

                        The definition of "security" is derived from UCC

                        the benefit of a trust.

                    Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one individual or multiple ownership by two or more individuals with right of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form. Multiple
                    owners of a security registered in beneficiary form hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as tenants by the entireties, or as owners of community property held in survivorship form, and not as tenants in common.

                        This section is designed to prevent co-owners from designating any death beneficiary other than one who is to take only upon survival of
                        <b>
        all
       </b> co-owners. It coerces co-owning registrants to signal whether they hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship (JT TEN), as tenants by the entireties (T ENT), or as owners of community property. Also, it imposes
                        survivorship on co-owners holding in a beneficiary form that fails to specify a survivorship form of holding. Tenancy in common and community property otherwise than in a survivorship setting is negated for registration in beneficiary
                        form because persons desiring to signal independent death beneficiaries for each individual's fractional interest in a co-owned security normally will split their holding into separate registrations of the number of units previously
                        constituting their fractional share. Once divided, each can name his or her own choice of death beneficiary.

                        The term "individuals," as used in this section, limits those who may register as owner or co-owner of a security in beneficiary form to natural persons. However, the section does not restrict individuals using this ownership form as to their choice of
                        death beneficiary. The definition of "beneficiary form" in Section 1 indicates that any "person" may be designated beneficiary in a registration in beneficiary form. "Person" is defined so that a church, trust company, family corporation,
                        or other entity, as well as any individual, may be designated as a beneficiary.

                        This section encourages registrations in beneficiary form to be made whenever a state with which either of the parties to a registration has contact has enacted this or a similar statute. Thus, a registration in beneficiary form of X Company shares might
                        rely on an enactment of this Act in X Company's state of incorporation, or in the state of incorporation of X Company's transfer agent. Or, an enactment by the state of the issuer's principal office, the transfer agent's principal
                        office, or of the issuer's office making the registration also would validate the registration. An enactment of the state of the registering owner's address at time of registration also might be used for validation purposes.

                        The abbreviation POD is included for use without regard for whether the subject is a money claim against an issuer, such as its own note or bond for money loaned, or is a claim to securities evidenced by conventional title documentation. The use of POD
                        in a registration in beneficiary form of shares in an investment company should not be taken as a signal that the investment is to be sold or redeemed on the owner's death so that the sums realized may be "paid" to the death beneficiary.
                        Rather, only a transfer on death, not a liquidation on death, is indicated. The committee would have used only the abbreviation TOD except for the familiarity, rooted in experience with certificates of deposit and other deposit
                        accounts in banks, with the abbreviation POD as signalling a valid nonprobate death benefit or transfer on death.

                        This section simply affirms the right of a sole owner, or the right of all multiple owners, to end a TOD beneficiary registration without the assent of the beneficiary. The section says nothing about how a TOD beneficiary designation may be canceled,
                        meaning that the registering entity's terms and conditions, if any, may be relevant. See Section 10. If the terms and conditions have nothing on the point, cancellation of a beneficiary designation presumably would be effected
                        by a reregistration showing a different beneficiary or omitting reference to a TOD beneficiary.

                    On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable

                    of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or
                    the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

                        Even though multiple owners holding in the beneficiary form here authorized hold with right of survivorship, no survivorship rights attend the positions of multiple beneficiaries who become entitled to securities by reason of having survived the sole
                        owner or the last to die of multiple owners. Issuers (and registering entities) who decide to accept registrations in beneficiary form involving more than one primary beneficiary also should provide by rule whether fractional shares
                        will be registered in the names of surviving beneficiaries where the number of shares held by the deceased owner does not divide without remnant among the survivors. If fractional shares are not desired, the issuer may wish to
                        provide for sale of odd shares and division of proceeds, for an uneven distribution with the first or last named to receive the odd share, or for other resolution. Section 8 deals with whether intermediaries have any obligation
                        to offer beneficiary registrations of any sort; Section 10 enables issuers to adopt terms and conditions controlling the details of applications for registrations they decide to accept and procedures for implementing such registrations
                        after an owner's death.

                        The reference to surviving, multiple TOD beneficiaries as tenants in common is not intended to suggest that a registration form specifying unequal shares, such as "TOD A (20%), B (30%), C (50%)," would be improper. Though not included in the beneficiary
                        forms described for illustrative purposes in Section 10, the Act enables a registering entity to accept and implement a TOD beneficiary designation like the one just suggested. If offered, such a registration form should be implemented
                        by registering entity terms and conditions providing for disposition of the share of a beneficiary who predeceases the owner when two or more of a group of multiple beneficiaries survive the owner. For example, the terms might
                        direct the share of the predeceased beneficiary to the survivors in the proportion that their original shares bore to each other. Unless unequal shares are specified in a registration in beneficiary form designating multiple beneficiaries,
                        the shares of the beneficiaries would, of course, be equal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statement that a security registered in beneficiary form is in the deceased owner's estate when no beneficiary survives the owner is not intended to prevent application of any anti-lapse statute that might direct a nonprobate transfer on death to
                        the surviving issue of a beneficiary who failed to survive the owner. Rather, the statement is intended only to indicate that the registering entity involved should transfer or reregister the security as directed by the decedent's
                        personal representative.

                        in the case of an uncertificated security. Section 8-308 describes the meaning of 'appropriate person' in the case of a certificated security as 'the person specified by the certificated security . . . to be entitled to the security.'

                        Use of "and" or "or" between the names of persons registered as co-owners is unnecessary under the Act and should be discouraged. If used, the two words should have the same meaning insofar as concerns a title form;
                        <i>

                        Descendants of a named beneficiary who take by virtue of a "LDPS" designation appended to a beneficiary's name take as TOD beneficiaries rather than as intestate successors. If no descendant of a predeceased primary beneficiary survives the owner, the

                        the property involved from the ambit of the Equitable Distribution Act, and the trial judge did not err in finding and concluding otherwise. Beroth v. Beroth, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 359 S.E.2d 512, cert.

                        Applicability to tenancies by the entireties which existed prior to January 1, 1983. - Provisions of subsection (a) of this section should generally be construed to apply to tenancies by the entirety which preexisted the effective date of the statute
                        (January 1, 1983) and such application is not, in and of itself, unconstitutional. Perry v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 341 S.E.2d 53 (1986), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 170</cite>,

        Rent from Entireties Property Was Not Entireties Property.

                        was not entireties property and thus, rents were property of estate and not exempt under applicable nonbankruptcy law. Although North Carolina statute gave married women equal rights to use and control income from entireties property,
                        this did not mean that income from property was entireties property. In re Adams, 506 B.R. 688 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2014).

                        The claim of a vested property right may not rest upon state enforcement of common law which is unconstitutionally discriminatory. Thus, to the extent that defendant husband's claims to the exclusive right of control and income of pre-1983 estates by
                        the entirety were based solely upon the common-law incidents of the tenancy, they would fail, as the right recognized by the common law could not be said to be a "vested property right." Perry v. Perry,

                        Applicability to tenancies by the entireties which existed prior to January 1, 1983. - Provisions of subsection (a) of this section should generally be construed to apply to tenancies by the entirety which preexisted the effective date of the statute
                        (January 1, 1983) and such application is not, in and of itself, unconstitutional. Perry v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 341 S.E.2d 53 (1986), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 170</cite>,

                        The General Assembly has clearly manifested its intention that this section, including the "equal right to control" provision of subsection (a), apply to estates by the entirety created before January 1, 1983. Perry v. Perry,

                        A tenant in common has a right to demand an accounting from a co-tenant; furthermore, plaintiff 's action for an accounting was still ripe because the statute of limitations did not begin running until her demand for an accounting was refused. Beam v.

        Rent from Entireties Property Was Not Entireties Property.
       </b> - Turnover of rents from real property held as tenants by entirety was ordered, as North Carolina did not recognize estate by entirety in personal property, and rent derived from real property held as tenants by entirety
                        was not entireties property and thus, rents were property of estate and not exempt under applicable nonbankruptcy law. Although North Carolina statute gave married women equal rights to use and control income from entireties property,
                        this did not mean that income from property was entireties property. In re Adams, 506 B.R. 688 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2014).

                        The claim of a vested property right may not rest upon state enforcement of common law which is unconstitutionally discriminatory. Thus, to the extent that defendant husband's claims to the exclusive right of control and income of pre-1983 estates by
                        the entirety were based solely upon the common-law incidents of the tenancy, they would fail, as the right recognized by the common law could not be said to be a "vested property right." Perry v. Perry,
                        <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 341 S.E.2d 53 (1986), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 170</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 925 (1987).

                        Burden of Proving Vested Rights. - There may be circumstances under which a husband's rights to income and control of pre-1983 tenancy by the entirety property, to the exclusion of his wife, may be classified as "vested rights" for reasons other than
                        the common-law incidents of that estate. In such cases, the burden will be upon the husband to demonstrate facts showing why his rights are "vested rights" such that application of the "equal control" provisions of subsection (a)
                        of this section to the estate would violate due process. Perry v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 341 S.E.2d 53 (1986), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 170</cite>,

                        he was considered to have received only one-half of the income, or $487.50 per month; it was therefore error for the trial court to attribute the full amount of rental income from the property to father. Kennedy v. Kennedy,

                        Applicability to tenancies by the entireties which existed prior to January 1, 1983. - Provisions of subsection (a) of this section should generally be construed to apply to tenancies by the entirety which preexisted the effective date of the statute
                        (January 1, 1983) and such application is not, in and of itself, unconstitutional. Perry v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 341 S.E.2d 53 (1986), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 170</cite>,

                        The General Assembly has clearly manifested its intention that this section, including the "equal right to control" provision of subsection (a), apply to estates by the entirety created before January 1, 1983. Perry v. Perry,

        Rent from Entireties Property Was Not Entireties Property.

                        was not entireties property and thus, rents were property of estate and not exempt under applicable nonbankruptcy law. Although North Carolina statute gave married women equal rights to use and control income from entireties property,
                        this did not mean that income from property was entireties property. In re Adams, 506 B.R. 688 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2014).

                        the common-law incidents of that estate. In such cases, the burden will be upon the husband to demonstrate facts showing why his rights are "vested rights" such that application of the "equal control" provisions of subsection (a)
                        of this section to the estate would violate due process. Perry v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 341 S.E.2d 53 (1986), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 170</cite>,

                        the property involved from the ambit of the Equitable Distribution Act, and the trial judge did not err in finding and concluding otherwise. Beroth v. Beroth, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 359 S.E.2d 512, cert.

                        The different solutions depending upon whether husband or wife is the slayer is not discretionary against the wife-slayer. Such disposition was deemed necessary in order to prevent the slayer-husband from having his vested property right forfeited for
                        crime or taken without due process, because North Carolina is one of only three states that have retained the common-law incident of tenancy by the entirety that "the husband has the control and use of the property and is entitled
                        to the possession, income, and usufruct thereof during their joint lives." Homanich v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 221 S.E.2d 739, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 614</cite>,

                        "Estate." - The word "estate" as used in this section means those persons, other than the slayer, who succeed to the rights of the decedent either by testate or intestate succession as the case may be. To accomplish the purpose of this section and consistent
                        with the clear language of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html#t31Aa03s31A-4" target="_blank">G.S. 31A-4</a></cite>, the slayer cannot be included in this class. In cases in which the
                        decedent has made testamentary disposition of the real property involved, this interpretation gives effect to the decedent's will. If there is no will, or if the decedent left a will but made no disposition therein of the real
                        property involved, the decedent's "estate" consists of those persons who become entitled to succeed to the decedent's property under the intestate succession laws. In either event under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html#t31Aa03s31A-4" target="_blank">G.S. 31A-4</a></cite>                        the slayer is not included. Porth v.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The correctness of the interpretation of the words "estate of the wife" in former subdivision (2) as meaning the estate as it came into existence at the moment of her actual death was strengthened by an examination of former subdivision (1) of this section,
                        which dealt with the situation when the wife is the slayer. In such case the statute provided that "one half of the property shall pass upon the death of the husband to his estate, and the other one half shall be held by the wife,
                        subject to pass upon her death to the estate of the husband." It was not reasonable to suppose that the legislature in former subdivision (1) intended the word "estate" to have one meaning as to one half of the property and another
                        meaning as to the other one half. Rather, it is more reasonable to suppose that the word "estate" as twice used in the same sentence was intended to have the same meaning, and that it refers to the estate of the deceased as such
                        estate comes into existence at the moment of actual death. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).

                    <p>
                        "The Estate of the Wife." - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html#t31Aa03s31A-4" target="_blank">G.S. 31A-4</a></cite> provides in part that, for purposes of distributing the estate of the decedent, "the slayer
                        shall be deemed to have died immediately prior to the death of the decedent." In view of this express statutory presumption, it was clear that the words "the estate of the wife" as the same were used in former subdivision (2) meant
                        the estate of the murdered wife as the same came into existence at the instant of her death, and the title to the entireties property at that moment passed to those persons who would be entitled to succeed to her interest in such
                        property as of the moment of her death if she had in fact survived her husband, subject only to his recognized right to "hold" the property during his lifetime. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165
                        S.E.2d 508 (1969).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The language "he shall hold all of the property during his life" was employed by the legislature, not for the purpose of barring any alienation of the property until after the slayer-husband's death, but in order to recognize and preserve the husband's
                        lifetime rights in the property. The legislature clearly intended that even the slayer-husband should not forfeit what was always recognized as his - the right to possession and income from the property for his lifetime. Porth
                        v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The words "shall hold," as used in this section were not intended to effect a complete restraint on alienation during the husband's lifetime. On the contrary, the word "hold," as used in the statute, is used in the same sense as when used in the habendum
                        clause of a deed. Certainly the word "hold" as used in the habendum clause of a deed is never construed to place a restraint on alienation, and the very words used in this statute, "hold all of the property during his life subject
                        to pass upon his death to the estate of the wife," if used in a deed, would not prevent the husband from selling his life interest in the property. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite>                        485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The words "pass upon his death" refer exclusively to possession and enjoyment of the property and not to vesting in interest. In effect, the slayer-husband holds a life estate in the property with a vested remainder in the estate of his deceased wife,
                        and the persons entitled to succeed to her estate are to be determined as of the actual date of her death, not as of the subsequent date when the husband's life estate terminates upon his death. This interpretation is further supported
                        by the express language of this chapter as well as by reference to the purposes to be achieved by the statute. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section recognizes distinction in rights held by husband as compared with rights held by wife in entirety property by providing that the slayer-husband shall hold all of the property during his life subject to pass upon his death to the estate of the
                        wife, whereas the slayer-wife is to hold only one half of the property during her lifetime subject to pass upon her death to the estate of the husband, while the other one half of the property in such case shall pass upon the death
                        of her husband to his estate. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The slayer-husband holds the interest of his deceased wife in the property as a trustee for her heirs at law. He should be perpetually enjoined from conveying the property in fee; the plaintiffs should be adjudged the sole owners, upon the decedent's
                        death, of the entire property as the heirs of their deceased mother. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Slayer-Husband Has Right to Lifetime Possession, Income and Usufruct. - In preserving the slayer-husband's right to hold all of the property during his life, former subdivision (2) of this section recognized his right to the lifetime possession, income,
                        and usufruct, of the property, and thereby avoided the possibility that the statute might be considered unconstitutional as working a forfeiture of a vested property right for crime. Porth v. Porth,
                        <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where husband and wife own real property as tenants by the entirety, the husband is solely entitled, to the exclusion of the wife, to the possession, income, and usufruct of such property during their joint lives. Porth v. Porth,
                        <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Estate of Decedent Determined at Date of Her Actual Death. - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html#t31Aa03s31A-4" target="_blank">G.S. 31A-4</a></cite> makes no attempt artificially to alter the date of the death
                        of the decedent, but provides instead that the actual date of death of the slayer is to be disregarded. Therefore, if the language of the statute is followed, the estate of the decedent is determined at the date of her actual death,
                        and the law calls the roll of the class immediately as of that time; those who can then answer, take. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section does not bar the alienation of the entire title to the property by joint conveyance of the slayer-husband and the heirs of the decedent. To so interpret the statute would run contrary to the established policy of North Carolina law, which
                        is to prevent undue restraint upon or suspension of the right of alienation. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The slayer-husband cannot convey more than his own interest in the entirety property and certainly no conveyance of his can work a detriment to the rights of the estate of his deceased wife. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite>                        485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Where there is a bequest to one for life, and after his decease to the testator's next of kin, the next of kin who are to take are the persons who answer that description at the death of the testator, and not those who answer that description at the death
                        of the first taker. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508 (1969).

                            Survivorship Only Abolished as Incident of Joint Tenancy. - This section abolished survivorship only where it follows as a legal incident to an existing joint tenancy. Vettori v. Fay, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 481</cite>,

                            "Estate" in Most General Sense Includes Choses in Action. - "Estate" is derived from status, and in its most general sense means position or standing in respect to the things and concerns of this world. In this sense it includes choses in action. Pippin
                            v. Ellison, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. 61</cite> (1851); Webb v. Bowler, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. 362</cite> (1858); Hurdle v. Outlaw, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 75</cite> (1854).

                            Estate is also used in a much more restricted sense, and is then put in opposition to a chose in action, or mere right, to signify something which one has in possession, or a vested remainder, or reversion without dispute or adverse possession. Taylor

                            Section Applies Only to Estates of Inheritance. - The act of 1784, converting joint tenancies into estates in common, applies only to estates of inheritance. Blair v. Osborne, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 417</cite> (1881);
                            Powell v. Morisey, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 421</cite> (1881).

                        <p>
                            If the purpose had been to include all estates in joint tenancy, that purpose would have been better served by abolishing the "jus accrescendi" in a few direct words to that effect, instead of resorting to words applicable only to estates of inheritance
                            held in joint tenancy in real estate, and absolute estates held in joint tenancy in personalty. Powell v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 450</cite> (1876).

                            This section which abolished the right of survivorship in joint tenancies in estates of inheritance, does not apply to a joint tenancy in a life estate where no estate of inheritance is involved. Dew v. Shockley, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                            87, 243 S.E.2d 177, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 465</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 9 (1978).

                            Concurrent Life Estates Not Affected. - Concurrent life estates still stand untouched by this section, and the old feudal presumption in favor of joint tenancies with survivorship remains.

                            life." Burton v. Cahill, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 505</cite>, 135 S.E. 332 (1926).

                            Survivorship May Be Provided for by Contract. - This section abolishes survivorship, where the joint tenancy would otherwise have been created by the law, but does not operate to prohibit persons from entering into written contracts as to land, or verbal
                            agreements as to personalty, such as to make the future rights of the parties depend upon the fact of survivorship. Taylor v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 531</cite>, 21 S.E. 202 (1895);

                            Joint Tenancy Severed by Deed of Trust. - When a mortgagee sought to foreclose on land held by a daughter and son-in-law and the daughter's mother, a trial court properly ruled that the son-in-law and daughter owned a one-half undivided interest in the
                            land which was not encumbered by a deed of trust to the benefit of the mortgagee because, after the son-in-law and daughter and the mother executed a general warranty deed creating a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship
                            between the mother and the son-in-law and daughter, that joint tenancy was severed by the filing of a deed of trust which only obligated the mother, as the accompanying mortgage was a conveyance, due to North Carolina being
                            a title theory state, so the mother, on one hand, and the son-in-law and daughter, on the other hand, held the land as tenants in common. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Reed, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite>                            504, 725 S.E.2d 667 (2012).

                            Instrument Held Ineffective to Provide for Survivorship. - While this section may not preclude tenants in common from providing for survivorship by adequate contract inter sese, an instrument executed by them which merely expresses a general intent that
                            the survivor should take the fee, without any words of conveyance, is ineffective. The execution by the administrator of the deceased tenant in common of a deed to the surviving tenant, made under the supposed authority of
                            the contract, is without effect. Pope v. Burgess, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 323</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 159 (1949).

                            Joint Tenant's Interest Did Not Pass to Daughter and Son-in-Law. - When a mortgagee sought to foreclose on land held by a daughter and son-in-law and the daughter's mother, a trial court erred in ruling that the mother's interest as a tenant in common
                            passed to the son-in-law and daughter upon the mother's death because the mother's interest as a tenant in common had no right of survivorship, since a joint tenancy previously created by a general warranty deed was severed
                            by the filing of a deed of trust that obligated only the mother. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Reed, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 725 S.E.2d 667 (2012).

                            land in fee simple absolute upon the mother's death because the mother's interest in the property as a tenant in common did not vest in the son-in-law and daughter pursuant to a right of survivorship. Countrywide Home Loans,

                            Section Inapplicable to Conveyances to Husband and Wife. - In construing this statute, the Supreme Court held that it had no application to an estate granted to husband and wife, on the ground that it is not an estate in joint tenancy, but an entirety
                            estate. Motley v. Whitemore, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 537</cite> (1837); Gray v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 439</cite>, 23 S.E. 318 (1895); Woolard v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 489</cite>,

                            pursuant to the contracts, and upon the death of the husband the widow is entitled to take the whole. Bowling v. Bowling, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 515</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 176 (1956).

                            interest as a tenant in common was one-half of the property, and the son-in-law's and daughter's interest, as tenants by the entirety, was also one-half because the son-in-law and daughter were husband and wife, so the son-in-law
                            and daughter held the property as a single tenancy by the entirety and were treated as a single party when determining interests in the joint tenancy with right of survivorship upon severance of the joint tenancy. Countrywide

                            partnership purposes is subject to partnership debts to the exclusion of the heir or widow of the deceased. When the partnership debts are satisfied, if there is any remainder, such share as would have fallen to the deceased

                        <p>
                            Heir May Recover from Surviving Partner. - The heir at law to whom a deceased partner had conveyed by deed his share of lands purchased with partnership funds is entitled to the lands against the rights of the surviving partner, in an action by the latter
                            for possession for the purpose of winding up the partnership affairs, when it appears that the partnership personalty is sufficient for the purpose of paying the partnership debts and satisfying any claim the surviving partner
                            may have, and there is no provision in the articles of the partnership agreement of a contrary purpose. Sherrod v. Mayo, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 144</cite>, 72 S.E. 216 (1911).

                            Immaterial Whether Claim Is by Deed or Inheritance. - When the rule applies that lands purchased by partnership funds descend to the heir at law, it is immaterial whether the heir of the deceased partner claims his interest by deed from him or by inheritance.

                            The fact that the surviving partner instituting action on a partnership asset has not filed a bond as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.059.html#t59a03s59-74" target="_blank">G.S. 59-74</a></cite>, is
                            not ground for nonsuit, since the requirement of a bond is for the protection of the estate of the deceased partner, and the objection is not available to one who is merely a debtor of the partnership. This conclusion is consonant
                            with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.059.html#t59a03s59-75" target="_blank">G.S. 59-75</a></cite>, which provides that upon failure of the surviving partner to file bond, the clerk of the superior court shall

                            Survivorship Only Abolished as Incident of Joint Tenancy. - This section abolished survivorship only where it follows as a legal incident to an existing joint tenancy. Vettori v. Fay, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 481</cite>,

                            Right of survivorship has been statutorily abolished where it follows as legal incident to an existing joint tenancy. In re Estate of Heffner, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 392 S.E.2d 770 (1990), decided under
                            law in effect prior to G.S. 53-146.1.

                            "Estate" in Most General Sense Includes Choses in Action. - "Estate" is derived from status, and in its most general sense means position or standing in respect to the things and concerns of this world. In this sense it includes choses in action. Pippin
                            v. Ellison, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. 61</cite> (1851); Webb v. Bowler, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. 362</cite> (1858); Hurdle v. Outlaw, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 75</cite> (1854).

                        <p>
                            Estate is also used in a much more restricted sense, and is then put in opposition to a chose in action, or mere right, to signify something which one has in possession, or a vested remainder, or reversion without dispute or adverse possession. Taylor
                            v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. 86</cite> (1856). See Bond v. Hilton, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. 180</cite> (1858).

                        <p>
                            Section Applies Only to Estates of Inheritance. - The act of 1784, converting joint tenancies into estates in common, applies only to estates of inheritance. Blair v. Osborne, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 417</cite> (1881);
                            Powell v. Morisey, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 421</cite> (1881).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the purpose had been to include all estates in joint tenancy, that purpose would have been better served by abolishing the "jus accrescendi" in a few direct words to that effect, instead of resorting to words applicable only to estates of inheritance
                            held in joint tenancy in real estate, and absolute estates held in joint tenancy in personalty. Powell v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 450</cite> (1876).

                        <p>
                            This section which abolished the right of survivorship in joint tenancies in estates of inheritance, does not apply to a joint tenancy in a life estate where no estate of inheritance is involved. Dew v. Shockley, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                            87, 243 S.E.2d 177, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 465</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 9 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Concurrent Life Estates Not Affected. - Concurrent life estates still stand untouched by this section, and the old feudal presumption in favor of joint tenancies with survivorship remains. Dew v. Shockley, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                            87, 243 S.E.2d 177, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 465</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 9 (1978).

                            Joint Estates for Life and Estates by Entirety Not Affected. - Joint tenancies are not abolished by the section. It abolishes the right of survivorship in joint tenancies in fee, but does not affect joint estates for life or estates by entirety. Vass

                            life." Burton v. Cahill, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 505</cite>, 135 S.E. 332 (1926).

                            Legatees May Hold as Joint Tenants. - Legatees may still hold by a joint tenancy in North Carolina, though the incident of survivorship was abolished by the act of 1784, now this section. Vass v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. 221</cite>                            (1857).

                            When Remaindermen Take as Tenants in Common. - A deed of gift, executed by W.B. to his son J.B., "during his natural life only, and then to return to the male children of the said J.B., lawfully begotten of his body, for the want of such to return to
                            the male children of my other sons W and B, their proper use, benefit and behoof of him, them and every of them, and to their heirs and assigns forever," vested a life estate in J.B., with remainder in fee to his sons as tenants
                            in common under the section. Brown v. Ward, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. 173</cite>, 9 S.E. 300 (1889).

                            Survivorship May Be Provided for by Contract. - This section abolishes survivorship, where the joint tenancy would otherwise have been created by the law, but does not operate to prohibit persons from entering into written contracts as to land, or verbal
                            agreements as to personalty, such as to make the future rights of the parties depend upon the fact of survivorship. Taylor v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 531</cite>, 21 S.E. 202 (1895);

                            Survivorship in Personalty Must Be Pursuant to Contract. - Since the abolition of survivorship in joint tenancy, the right of survivorship in personalty, if such right exists, must be pursuant to contract and not by operation of law or statutory provision.
                            Wilson v. Ervin, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 396</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 468 (1947); Bowling v. Bowling, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 515</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 176 (1956).

                            Joint Tenancy Severed by Deed of Trust. - When a mortgagee sought to foreclose on land held by a daughter and son-in-law and the daughter's mother, a trial court properly ruled that the son-in-law and daughter owned a one-half undivided interest in the
                            land which was not encumbered by a deed of trust to the benefit of the mortgagee because, after the son-in-law and daughter and the mother executed a general warranty deed creating a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship
                            between the mother and the son-in-law and daughter, that joint tenancy was severed by the filing of a deed of trust which only obligated the mother, as the accompanying mortgage was a conveyance, due to North Carolina being
                            a title theory state, so the mother, on one hand, and the son-in-law and daughter, on the other hand, held the land as tenants in common. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Reed, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite>                            504, 725 S.E.2d 667 (2012).

                            Instrument Held Ineffective to Provide for Survivorship. - While this section may not preclude tenants in common from providing for survivorship by adequate contract inter sese, an instrument executed by them which merely expresses a general intent that
                            the survivor should take the fee, without any words of conveyance, is ineffective. The execution by the administrator of the deceased tenant in common of a deed to the surviving tenant, made under the supposed authority of
                            the contract, is without effect. Pope v. Burgess, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 323</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 159 (1949).

                            Joint Tenant's Interest Did Not Pass to Daughter and Son-in-Law. - When a mortgagee sought to foreclose on land held by a daughter and son-in-law and the daughter's mother, a trial court erred in ruling that the mother's interest as a tenant in common
                            passed to the son-in-law and daughter upon the mother's death because the mother's interest as a tenant in common had no right of survivorship, since a joint tenancy previously created by a general warranty deed was severed
                            by the filing of a deed of trust that obligated only the mother. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Reed, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 725 S.E.2d 667 (2012).

                            land in fee simple absolute upon the mother's death because the mother's interest in the property as a tenant in common did not vest in the son-in-law and daughter pursuant to a right of survivorship. Countrywide Home Loans,

                            Section Inapplicable to Conveyances to Husband and Wife. - In construing this statute, the Supreme Court held that it had no application to an estate granted to husband and wife, on the ground that it is not an estate in joint tenancy, but an entirety
                            estate. Motley v. Whitemore, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 537</cite> (1837); Gray v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 439</cite>, 23 S.E. 318 (1895); Woolard v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 489</cite>,

                            The act of 1784, now this section, abolishing survivorship in joint tenancies, does not apply to conveyances to husband and wife, for the reason assigned in Motley v. Whitemore, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 537</cite> (1837),
                            that "being in law but one person they have each the whole estate as one person; and on the death of either of them the whole estate continues in the survivor." Long v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 329</cite> (1882);

                            Survivorship in Joint Bank Accounts. - Where agreements of husband and wife relating to savings accounts provide that the accounts are held by them as joint tenants with right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common, the right of survivorship exists
                            pursuant to the contracts, and upon the death of the husband the widow is entitled to take the whole. Bowling v. Bowling, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 515</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 176 (1956).

                            Estate by Entireties Not Abolished. - It has been held in several well considered decisions of the Supreme Court that our Constitution and the later statutes relative to the property and rights of married women have not thus far destroyed or altered the
                            nature of this estate by entireties, a conveyance to a husband and wife. Bruce v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 202</cite>, 13 S.E. 790 (1891); Ray v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 891</cite>,

                            The right of survivorship applies to estates in land conveyed jointly to husband and wife, and title vests in the heirs of the one surviving the other. Murchison v. Fogleman, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 397</cite>, 81 S.E.

                            A conveyance to a husband and wife, as such, creates an estate of entirety, and does not make them joint tenants or tenants in common. Neither can alien without the consent of the other, and the survivor takes the whole. Needham v. Branson,

                            Interest of Husband and Wife as Tenants in Common. - When a joint tenancy between a mother, on one hand, and a son-in-law and daughter, on the other hand, was severed by the filing of a deed of trust that obligated only the mother, the mother's subsequent
                            interest as a tenant in common was one-half of the property, and the son-in-law's and daughter's interest, as tenants by the entirety, was also one-half because the son-in-law and daughter were husband and wife, so the son-in-law
                            and daughter held the property as a single tenancy by the entirety and were treated as a single party when determining interests in the joint tenancy with right of survivorship upon severance of the joint tenancy. Countrywide

                            Joint Tenancy of Partnership in Land. - This section provides that land jointly purchased for partnership purposes shall, upon the death of one partner, survive to the others for the purpose of paying the partnership debts. Real estate held and used for
                            partnership purposes is subject to partnership debts to the exclusion of the heir or widow of the deceased. When the partnership debts are satisfied, if there is any remainder, such share as would have fallen to the deceased
                            partner, shall be delivered over to the heirs, executors, administrators or assigns. Stroud v. Stroud, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. 525</cite> (1868).

                            Upon Settlement Partnership Land Descends as Real Estate. - When land is purchased in fee by partnership funds and for partnership purposes, and one partner dies, upon the settlement of the partnership debts his share of the land descends to his heir
                            as real estate. Summey v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. 601</cite> (1864).

                            When lands are purchased by a partnership with partnership funds, upon the death of one of the partners, in the absence of any agreement in the articles of partnership to the contrary, his share therein descends to his heir at law as real estate, if the
                            personal property of the partnership is sufficient to pay all the partnership debts and demands. Sherrod v. Mayo, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 144</cite>, 72 S.E. 216 (1911).

                            for possession for the purpose of winding up the partnership affairs, when it appears that the partnership personalty is sufficient for the purpose of paying the partnership debts and satisfying any claim the surviving partner
                            may have, and there is no provision in the articles of the partnership agreement of a contrary purpose. Sherrod v. Mayo, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 144</cite>, 72 S.E. 216 (1911).

                            The fact that the surviving partner instituting action on a partnership asset has not filed a bond as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.059.html#t59a03s59-74" target="_blank">G.S. 59-74</a></cite>, is
                            not ground for nonsuit, since the requirement of a bond is for the protection of the estate of the deceased partner, and the objection is not available to one who is merely a debtor of the partnership. This conclusion is consonant
                            with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.059.html#t59a03s59-75" target="_blank">G.S. 59-75</a></cite>, which provides that upon failure of the surviving partner to file bond, the clerk of the superior court shall

                            Survivorship Only Abolished as Incident of Joint Tenancy. - This section abolished survivorship only where it follows as a legal incident to an existing joint tenancy. Vettori v. Fay, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 481</cite>,

                            Right of survivorship has been statutorily abolished where it follows as legal incident to an existing joint tenancy. In re Estate of Heffner, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 392 S.E.2d 770 (1990), decided under

                            "Estate" in Most General Sense Includes Choses in Action. - "Estate" is derived from status, and in its most general sense means position or standing in respect to the things and concerns of this world. In this sense it includes choses in action. Pippin
                            v. Ellison, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. 61</cite> (1851); Webb v. Bowler, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. 362</cite> (1858); Hurdle v. Outlaw, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 75</cite> (1854).

                            Estate is also used in a much more restricted sense, and is then put in opposition to a chose in action, or mere right, to signify something which one has in possession, or a vested remainder, or reversion without dispute or adverse possession. Taylor

                        <p>
                            Section Applies Only to Estates of Inheritance. - The act of 1784, converting joint tenancies into estates in common, applies only to estates of inheritance. Blair v. Osborne, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 417</cite> (1881);
                            Powell v. Morisey, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 421</cite> (1881).

                        <p>
                            If the purpose had been to include all estates in joint tenancy, that purpose would have been better served by abolishing the "jus accrescendi" in a few direct words to that effect, instead of resorting to words applicable only to estates of inheritance
                            held in joint tenancy in real estate, and absolute estates held in joint tenancy in personalty. Powell v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 450</cite> (1876).

                            This section which abolished the right of survivorship in joint tenancies in estates of inheritance, does not apply to a joint tenancy in a life estate where no estate of inheritance is involved. Dew v. Shockley, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                            87, 243 S.E.2d 177, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 465</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 9 (1978).

                            Concurrent Life Estates Not Affected. - Concurrent life estates still stand untouched by this section, and the old feudal presumption in favor of joint tenancies with survivorship remains.

                            the male children of my other sons W and B, their proper use, benefit and behoof of him, them and every of them, and to their heirs and assigns forever," vested a life estate in J.B., with remainder in fee to his sons as tenants
                            in common under the section. Brown v. Ward, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. 173</cite>, 9 S.E. 300 (1889).

                            Survivorship May Be Provided for by Contract. - This section abolishes survivorship, where the joint tenancy would otherwise have been created by the law, but does not operate to prohibit persons from entering into written contracts as to land, or verbal
                            agreements as to personalty, such as to make the future rights of the parties depend upon the fact of survivorship. Taylor v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 531</cite>, 21 S.E. 202 (1895);

                            Survivorship in Personalty Must Be Pursuant to Contract. - Since the abolition of survivorship in joint tenancy, the right of survivorship in personalty, if such right exists, must be pursuant to contract and not by operation of law or statutory provision.

                            Joint Tenancy Severed by Deed of Trust. - When a mortgagee sought to foreclose on land held by a daughter and son-in-law and the daughter's mother, a trial court properly ruled that the son-in-law and daughter owned a one-half undivided interest in the
                            land which was not encumbered by a deed of trust to the benefit of the mortgagee because, after the son-in-law and daughter and the mother executed a general warranty deed creating a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship
                            between the mother and the son-in-law and daughter, that joint tenancy was severed by the filing of a deed of trust which only obligated the mother, as the accompanying mortgage was a conveyance, due to North Carolina being
                            a title theory state, so the mother, on one hand, and the son-in-law and daughter, on the other hand, held the land as tenants in common. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Reed, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite>                            504, 725 S.E.2d 667 (2012).

                            Instrument Held Ineffective to Provide for Survivorship. - While this section may not preclude tenants in common from providing for survivorship by adequate contract inter sese, an instrument executed by them which merely expresses a general intent that
                            the survivor should take the fee, without any words of conveyance, is ineffective. The execution by the administrator of the deceased tenant in common of a deed to the surviving tenant, made under the supposed authority of
                            the contract, is without effect. Pope v. Burgess, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 323</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 159 (1949).

                            Joint Tenant's Interest Did Not Pass to Daughter and Son-in-Law. - When a mortgagee sought to foreclose on land held by a daughter and son-in-law and the daughter's mother, a trial court erred in ruling that the mother's interest as a tenant in common
                            passed to the son-in-law and daughter upon the mother's death because the mother's interest as a tenant in common had no right of survivorship, since a joint tenancy previously created by a general warranty deed was severed
                            by the filing of a deed of trust that obligated only the mother. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Reed, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 725 S.E.2d 667 (2012).

                            land in fee simple absolute upon the mother's death because the mother's interest in the property as a tenant in common did not vest in the son-in-law and daughter pursuant to a right of survivorship. Countrywide Home Loans,

                            Section Inapplicable to Conveyances to Husband and Wife. - In construing this statute, the Supreme Court held that it had no application to an estate granted to husband and wife, on the ground that it is not an estate in joint tenancy, but an entirety
                            estate. Motley v. Whitemore, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 537</cite> (1837); Gray v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 439</cite>, 23 S.E. 318 (1895); Woolard v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 489</cite>,

                            The act of 1784, now this section, abolishing survivorship in joint tenancies, does not apply to conveyances to husband and wife, for the reason assigned in Motley v. Whitemore, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 537</cite> (1837),
                            that "being in law but one person they have each the whole estate as one person; and on the death of either of them the whole estate continues in the survivor." Long v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 329</cite> (1882);

                            Survivorship in Joint Bank Accounts. - Where agreements of husband and wife relating to savings accounts provide that the accounts are held by them as joint tenants with right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common, the right of survivorship exists
                            pursuant to the contracts, and upon the death of the husband the widow is entitled to take the whole. Bowling v. Bowling, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 515</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 176 (1956).

                            Estate by Entireties Not Abolished. - It has been held in several well considered decisions of the Supreme Court that our Constitution and the later statutes relative to the property and rights of married women have not thus far destroyed or altered the
                            nature of this estate by entireties, a conveyance to a husband and wife. Bruce v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 202</cite>, 13 S.E. 790 (1891); Ray v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 891</cite>,

                            The right of survivorship applies to estates in land conveyed jointly to husband and wife, and title vests in the heirs of the one surviving the other. Murchison v. Fogleman, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 397</cite>, 81 S.E.
                            627 (1914).

                            A conveyance to a husband and wife, as such, creates an estate of entirety, and does not make them joint tenants or tenants in common. Neither can alien without the consent of the other, and the survivor takes the whole. Needham v. Branson,

                            Interest of Husband and Wife as Tenants in Common. - When a joint tenancy between a mother, on one hand, and a son-in-law and daughter, on the other hand, was severed by the filing of a deed of trust that obligated only the mother, the mother's subsequent
                            interest as a tenant in common was one-half of the property, and the son-in-law's and daughter's interest, as tenants by the entirety, was also one-half because the son-in-law and daughter were husband and wife, so the son-in-law
                            and daughter held the property as a single tenancy by the entirety and were treated as a single party when determining interests in the joint tenancy with right of survivorship upon severance of the joint tenancy. Countrywide

                            Joint Tenancy of Partnership in Land. - This section provides that land jointly purchased for partnership purposes shall, upon the death of one partner, survive to the others for the purpose of paying the partnership debts. Real estate held and used for
                            partnership purposes is subject to partnership debts to the exclusion of the heir or widow of the deceased. When the partnership debts are satisfied, if there is any remainder, such share as would have fallen to the deceased
                            partner, shall be delivered over to the heirs, executors, administrators or assigns. Stroud v. Stroud, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. 525</cite> (1868).

                            Upon Settlement Partnership Land Descends as Real Estate. - When land is purchased in fee by partnership funds and for partnership purposes, and one partner dies, upon the settlement of the partnership debts his share of the land descends to his heir
                            as real estate. Summey v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. 601</cite> (1864).

                        <p>
                            When lands are purchased by a partnership with partnership funds, upon the death of one of the partners, in the absence of any agreement in the articles of partnership to the contrary, his share therein descends to his heir at law as real estate, if the
                            personal property of the partnership is sufficient to pay all the partnership debts and demands. Sherrod v. Mayo, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 144</cite>, 72 S.E. 216 (1911).

                            Heir May Recover from Surviving Partner. - The heir at law to whom a deceased partner had conveyed by deed his share of lands purchased with partnership funds is entitled to the lands against the rights of the surviving partner, in an action by the latter
                            for possession for the purpose of winding up the partnership affairs, when it appears that the partnership personalty is sufficient for the purpose of paying the partnership debts and satisfying any claim the surviving partner
                            may have, and there is no provision in the articles of the partnership agreement of a contrary purpose. Sherrod v. Mayo, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 144</cite>, 72 S.E. 216 (1911).

                            Immaterial Whether Claim Is by Deed or Inheritance. - When the rule applies that lands purchased by partnership funds descend to the heir at law, it is immaterial whether the heir of the deceased partner claims his interest by deed from him or by inheritance.

                            Coppersmith v. Upton, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 545</cite>, 46 S.E.2d 565 (1948).

                        <p>
                            The fact that the surviving partner instituting action on a partnership asset has not filed a bond as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.059.html#t59a03s59-74" target="_blank">G.S. 59-74</a></cite>, is
                            not ground for nonsuit, since the requirement of a bond is for the protection of the estate of the deceased partner, and the objection is not available to one who is merely a debtor of the partnership. This conclusion is consonant
                            with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.059.html#t59a03s59-75" target="_blank">G.S. 59-75</a></cite>, which provides that upon failure of the surviving partner to file bond, the clerk of the superior court shall
