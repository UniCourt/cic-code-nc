                <p>
                    "(b) The base supplement rate shall be an amount calculated by the Department based on the requirements of this section. The minimum base supplement rate that shall be provided to employees serving in a high-need correctional facility is two thousand
                    five hundred dollars ($2,500) annually.

                        Actuarial Equivalent. - The actuarial value includes interest and there was no double recovery where the court was following the definition of actuarial equivalent as prescribed by this section and included interest in the underpayment award. Faulkenbury

                        Retirement Law Is Valid. - It is the verdict of the General Assembly, embodied and expressed in this and the following sections, that the retirement plan has a definite relation to the just and efficient administration of the public school system which
                        brings it within the scope of constitutional authority. Under the mandatory provisions of the retirement law, the public policy thus expressed is applied to the entire public school system and its administration at the hands of
                        every administrative unit within it. Bridges v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 472</cite>, 20 S.E.2d 825 (1942).

                        The retirement law is sufficiently invested with a public purpose and is a constitutional and valid expression of the legislative will, both generally and in its application to the local administrative units with which it deals. Bridges v. City of Charlotte,

                        The purpose of this and the following sections is to provide benefits on retirement for the teachers in the public school system of the State and for State employees. It is based not only upon the principle of justice to poorly paid State employees, but
                        also upon the philosophy that a measure of freedom from apprehension of old age and disability will add to the immediate efficiency of those engaged in carrying on a work of first importance to society and the State. Bridges v.

                        Postjudgment Interest Not Awardable Against State. - Retirees under the state and local government retirement system were not entitled to post-judgment interest on retroactive disability benefits, because the state retirement statutes contain no provision
                        for the allowance of such interest. Faulkenbury v. Teachers' &amp; State Employees' Retirement Sys., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 137, 510 S.E.2d 675, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 379</cite>,

                        Retiree Not Entitled to Tax-Free Pension. - Retiree was not entitled to a tax free pension because he withdrew his contributions to the Consolidated Judicial Retirement System and the Teachers' and State Employees Retirement System and left public employment
                        before August 12, 1989, and thus he was not vested on that date; although the retiree later returned to public employment, became vested, and repaid the money he had previously withdrawn, when read together,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-4" target="_self">G.S. 135-4</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-5" target="_self">G.S. 135-5</a></cite> made clear that a member who left state service and withdrew
                        contributions in the retirement system had no rights to any benefits within the system except for the right to repay previously withdrawn contributions as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-4" target="_self">G.S. 135-4</a></cite>.
                        The repayment served only to increase the retiree's years of service creditable. Cashwell v. Dep't of State Treasurer, Ret. Sys. Div., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 675 S.E.2d 73 (2009).

                        Current benefits includes accumulated leave time. - "Current benefits" includes the amount of accumulated leave time that a university employee has available for use at the time the inspection is requested. As such, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.126.html#t126a07s126-23" target="_blank">G.S. 126-23</a></cite>                        requires the university system to provide the accumulated leave time for employees.

                        Current benefits includes accumulated leave time. - Leave time is a benefit required to be kept open for public inspection in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.126.html#t126a07s126-23" target="_blank">G.S. 126-23</a></cite>.
                        Sick leave balances, vacation leave balances, bonus leave balances, and compensatory time accrued are therefore current benefits to university employees which should be made available for inspection and copying upon request. See

                    of North Carolina. The Retirement System so created shall be established as of the first day of July, 1941.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Retirement System is a governmental plan, within the meaning of Section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, the nondiscrimination rules of Sections 401(a)(5) and 401(a)(26) of the Code do not apply. This System shall have the power and
                    privileges of a corporation and shall be known as the "Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System of North Carolina," and by such name all of its business shall be transacted, all of its funds invested, and all of its cash and

                <p>
                    Consistent with Section 401(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, all contributions from participating employers and participating employees to this Retirement System shall be made to funds held in trust through trust instruments that have the purposes
                    of distributing trust principal and income to retired members and their beneficiaries and of paying other definitely determinable benefits under this Chapter, after meeting the necessary expenses of administering this Retirement System.
                    Neither the trust corpus nor income from this trust can be used for purposes other than the exclusive benefit of members or their beneficiaries, except that employer contributions made to the trust under a good faith mistake of fact
                    may be returned to an employer, where the refund can occur within less than one year after the mistaken contribution was made, consistent with the rule adopted by the Board of Trustees. The Retirement System shall have a consolidated
                    Plan document, consisting of Article V, Section 6(2) of the North Carolina Constitution, relevant statutory provisions in this Chapter; associated regulations in the North Carolina Administrative Code, substantive and procedural information

                        Constitutionality of Sub-Subdivision (8)d. - Because all retired officers and employees are subject to the provisions of sub-subdivision (8)d of this section, plaintiff retired judge was not treated differently than similarly situated persons, and the
                        Retirement System's interpretation of sub-subdivision (8)d did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of either the United States or the North Carolina Constitution. Wells v. Consolidated Judicial Retirement Sys.,

                        Suspension of Benefits. - In case involving suspension of plaintiff retired judge's retirement benefits after he was appointed to another state office, where the prohibition contained in sub-subdivision (8)d of this section existed as former (8)c when
                        plaintiff's rights vested in the Retirement System, the prohibition applied to plaintiff, and plaintiff's contract under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.135.html" target="_blank">Chapter 135</a></cite>                        provided that his benefits would cease if he returned to employment with the State of North Carolina following his retirement from the court.

                    <p>
                        Suspension of the retirement benefits of a retired judge who was appointed to state utilities commission, while he served on that commission, was proper even though the statute authorizing the suspension of a retired judge's pension only spoke of suspending
                        the benefits of a retired judge who returned to judicial service, because the broader provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-3" target="_self">G.S. 135-3(8)(c)</a></cite>, disallowing continued
                        receipt of benefits by a contributor to the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System of North Carolina, applied to the judge. Wells v. Consol. Judicial Ret. Sys., <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 313</cite>, 553 S.E.2d 877

        Employee Reentering State Employment After Retirement.
       </b> - When an employee, age 62, retires on July 1, 1959, and receives retirement benefits until July 1, 1964, at which time he reenters State employment, when that employee subsequently retires on July 1, 1969, he is entitled
                        to the resumption of payment of his retirement benefits suspended while he was reemployed, plus additional benefits based on a salary over the most recent 5 years' employment figured at the current formula rate. He is not entitled
                        to benefits using the current formula and his total service recently plus that prior to his first retirement. Opinion of Attorney General to Mr. J.E. Miller, Director, Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System, 40 N.C.A.G.

                    The member shall purchase this service by making a lump-sum amount payable to the Annuity Savings Fund equal to the full liability of the service credits calculated on the basis of the assumptions used for purposes of the actuarial valuation of the liabilities
                    of the retirement system, and the calculation of the amount payable shall take into account the retirement allowance arising on account of the additional service credit commencing at the earliest age at which the member could retire
                    on an unreduced retirement allowance, as determined by the Board of Trustees upon the advice of the consulting actuary, plus an administrative fee to be set by the Board of Trustees. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection

                    private nonprofit corporation or a charter school operated by a municipality whose board of directors did not elect to participate in the Retirement System under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-5.3" target="_self">G.S. 135-5.3</a></cite>                    upon completion of five years of membership service by making a lump-sum payment into the Annuity Savings Fund. The payment by the member shall be equal to the full liability of the service credits calculated on the basis of the assumptions
                    used for purposes of the actuarial valuation of the Retirement System's liabilities, taking into account the additional retirement allowance arising on account of the additional service credits commencing at the earliest age at which
                    the member could retire with an unreduced retirement allowance, as determined by the Board of Trustees upon the advice of the actuary plus an administrative expense fee to be determined by the Board of Trustees. Creditable service

                    with applicable law and the member provides evidence satisfactory to the Retirement System that such amount qualifies for rollover treatment. Unless received by the Retirement System in the form of a direct rollover, the rollover contribution
                    must be paid to the Retirement System on or before the 60th day after the date it was received by the member.

                    creditable service purchased under this subsection may not exceed a total of five years. The member shall purchase this service by making a lump-sum amount payable to the Annuity Savings Fund equal to the full liability increase due
                    to the additional service credits on the basis of the assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuation of the liabilities of the Retirement System, except for the following assumptions specific to this calculation: (i)
                    the allowance shall be assumed to commence at the earliest age at which the member could retire on an unreduced retirement allowance and (ii) assumed annual postretirement allowance increases as set by the Board of Trustees upon the

                    after December 1, 2012, then that member shall forfeit all benefits under this System, except for a return of member contributions plus interest. If a member who is in service and has vested in this System on December 1, 2012, is convicted

                    (jj) Contribution-Based Benefit Cap Purchase Provision. - If a member's retirement allowance is subject to an adjustment pursuant to the contribution-based benefit cap established in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-5" target="_self">G.S. 135-5(a3)</a></cite>,
                    the retirement system shall notify the member and the member's employer that the member's retirement allowance has been capped. The retirement system shall compute and notify the member and the member's employer of the total additional
                    amount the member would need to contribute in order to make the member not subject to the contribution-based benefit cap. This total additional amount shall be the actuarial equivalent of a single life annuity adjusted for the age
                    of the member at the time of retirement, or when appropriate, the age at the time of the member's death that would have had to have been purchased to increase the member's benefit to the pre-cap level. Except as otherwise provided
                    in this subsection, the member shall have until 90 days after notification regarding this additional amount or until 90 days after the effective date of retirement, whichever is later, to submit a lump sum payment to the annuity savings
                    fund in order for the retirement system to restore the retirement allowance to the uncapped amount. Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent an employer from paying all or part of the cost of the amount necessary to restore
                    the member's retirement allowance to the pre-cap amount. Notwithstanding the requirement that the payment be made as a lump sum, the retirement system may allow an employer of a member who became a member before January 1, 2015, or
                    who has not earned at least five years of membership service in the retirement system after January 1, 2015, to pay the lump-sum amount required in this subsection on an installment payment plan under one of the following two options:
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1) Option one. - An installment payment plan ending no more than 15 months after the retirement of the member.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) Option two. - An installment payment plan ending no more than 27 months after the retirement of the member. Interest shall be assessed on the principal amount of the contribution-based benefit cap liability owed and applied to any installment payment
                    plan term exceeding 12 months at a rate corresponding with the interest rate assumption based on the most recent actuarial valuation approved by the Board of Trustees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payment under both installment plans must be completed regardless of whether the member continues to receive a recurring monthly retirement benefit through the end of the installment period.

                    such service credit by paying in a total lump sum an amount, based on the compensation the member earned when he first entered membership and the employee contribution rate at that time, with sufficient interest added thereto so as
                    to equal one half the cost of allowing such service, plus a fee to cover expense of handling payment to be determined by the Board of Trustees and assessed the member at the time of payment; provided that credit will be allowed only

                    that period of active service in the armed forces of the United States not creditable in any other retirement system, except the national guard or any reserve component of the armed forces of the United States. These provisions shall

                    to full-time service which would be allowable under the laws governing this System. Credit will be allowed only if no benefit is allowable in another public retirement system as a result of the service. Payment shall be permitted only
                    on a total lump sum, an amount based on the compensation the member earned when he first entered membership and the employee contribution rate at that time and shall be equal to the full cost of providing credit for such service plus

                        do so. Osborne v. Consolidated Judicial Retirement Sys., <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 246</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 115 (1993).

                        Rule Making. - Retirement Systems Division of the Department of State Treasurer erred in invoicing a school employee or school board for contributions to the employee's retirement fund pursuant to a statutory cap factor because the factor was a rule not
                        properly adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. Cabarrus Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Dep't of State Treasurer, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 325, 821 S.E.2d 196 (2018), aff'd,

                        Employee Held Not in Service for Death Benefit Purposes. - Where employee did not contribute to the Retirement System after being placed on leave without pay, the possible extension provided by this section for plan members who contribute while on leave
                        of absence did not apply. Therefore, employee's death occurred more than 90 days after his last day of actual service, and he was not in service at the time of his death and thus, his beneficiary is not eligible for the death benefit.

                        Retiree Not Entitled to Tax-Free Pension. - Retiree was not entitled to a tax free pension because he withdrew his contributions to the Consolidated Judicial Retirement System and the Teachers' and State Employees Retirement System and left public employment
                        before August 12, 1989, and thus he was not vested on that date; although the retiree later returned to public employment, became vested, and repaid the money he had previously withdrawn, when read together,

                        contributions in the retirement system had no rights to any benefits within the system except for the right to repay previously withdrawn contributions as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-4" target="_self">G.S. 135-4</a></cite>.
                        The repayment served only to increase the retiree's years of service creditable. Cashwell v. Dep't of State Treasurer, Ret. Sys. Div., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 675 S.E.2d 73 (2009).

        Employee Reentering State Employment After Retirement.
       </b> - When an employee, age 62, retires on July 1, 1959, and receives retirement benefits until July 1, 1964, at which time he reenters State employment, when that employee subsequently retires on July 1, 1969, he is entitled
                        to the resumption of payment of his retirement benefits suspended while he was reemployed, plus additional benefits based on a salary over the most recent 5 years' employment figured at the current formula rate. He is not entitled
                        to benefits using the current formula and his total service recently plus that prior to his first retirement. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. J.E. Miller, Director, Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System, 40 N.C.A.G.

                                earned as an employee during the 12 consecutive months of service in the final 48 months prior to retirement producing the highest gross compensation excluding any compensation received on account of termination. If the
                                disability beneficiary is earning or is able to earn more than the difference, the portion of his disability retirement allowance not provided by his contributions shall be reduced to an amount which, together with the
                                portion of the disability retirement allowance provided by his contributions and the amount earnable by him shall equal the amount of his gross compensation prior to retirement. This difference shall be increased on January
                                1 each year by the percentage change between the December Consumer Price Index in the year prior to retirement and the December Consumer Price Index in the year most recently ended, calculated to the nearest tenth of one
                                percent (1/10 of 1%), provided that this percentage change is positive. Should the earning capacity of the disability beneficiary later change, the portion of his disability retirement allowance not provided by his contributions

                    Notwithstanding the above provisions, the Board of Trustees may and is specifically authorized to provide the death benefit according to the terms and conditions otherwise appearing in this Plan in the form of group life insurance, either (i) by purchasing
                    a contract or contracts of group life insurance with any life insurance company or companies licensed and authorized to transact business in this State for the purpose of insuring the lives of members in service, or (ii) by establishing
                    a separate trust fund qualified under Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, for such purpose. To that end the Board of Trustees is authorized, empowered and directed to investigate the desirability of
                    utilizing group life insurance by either of the foregoing methods for the purpose of providing the death benefit. If a separate trust fund is established, it shall be operated in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the
                    Board of Trustees and all investment earnings on the trust fund shall be credited to such fund.

                <p>
                    (3) For a period when a member is on leave of absence, his status with respect to the death benefit will be determined by the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-4ol1h" target="_self">G.S. 135-4(h)</a></cite>.

                    (4) A member on leave of absence from his position as a teacher or State employee for the purpose of serving as a member or officer of the General Assembly shall be deemed to be in service during sessions of the General Assembly and thereby covered by
                    the provisions of the death benefit. The amount of the death benefit for such member shall be the equivalent of the salary to which the member would have been entitled as a teacher or State employee during the 12-month period immediately
                    prior to the month in which death occurred, not to be less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) nor to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).

                    postretirement increases equal to the annual increase in the U.S. Consumer Price Index. Postretirement increases on any other allowance will not apply to the special retirement allowance. The Board of Trustees shall provide educational
                    materials to the members who apply for the transfer authorized by this section. Those materials shall describe the special retirement allowance and shall explain the relationship between the transferred balance and the monthly benefit
                    and how the member's heirs may be impacted by the election to make this transfer and any costs and fees involved.

                    For the purpose of determining the special retirement allowance, the Board of Trustees shall adopt straight life annuity factors on the basis of yields on U.S. Treasury Bonds and mortality and such other tables as may be necessary based upon actual experience.
                    A single set of mortality and such other tables will be used for all members, with factors differing only based on the age of the member and the election of postretirement increases. The Board of Trustees shall modify the mortality
                    and such other tables every five years, as shall be deemed necessary, based upon the five-year experience study as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-6ol1n" target="_self">G.S. 135-6(n)</a></cite>.
                    Provided, however, a member who transfers the member's eligible accumulated contributions from an eligible retirement plan pursuant to this subsection to this Retirement System shall be taxed for North Carolina State Income Tax purposes
                    on the special retirement allowance the same as if that special retirement allowance had been paid directly by the eligible plan or the plan through which the transfer was made, whichever is most favorable to the member. The Teachers'
                    and State Employees' Retirement System shall be responsible to determine the taxable amount, if any, and report accordingly.

                        recommendation, case law did not support such an implied exemption, and the public interests supported the Board of Education's contention that the cap factor should be established by using the APA's rulemaking provisions to ensure

                        Grant of Disability Retirement Benefits Terminated Status as "Career Teacher". - The granting of a career teacher's application for disability retirement benefits under the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System operated as an acceptance of
                        her resignation by implication and terminated her status as a "career teacher" under former G.S. 115-142, since a finding that her disability was "likely to be permanent" was implicit in the granting of her application for disability
                        retirement benefits and this finding rendered her status as a disabled retiree wholly inconsistent with her former status as a "career teacher". Meachan v. Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite>                        271, 267 S.E.2d 349 (1980).

                        Widow of a prison guard was not entitled to death benefits where the guard's last day of service was ruled to be the date his sick and annual leave expired, and not the date his position was vacated, and thus his death, which occurred more than 90 days
                        after his last day of service, did not occur while "in service" within the meaning of the benefits provision. Garrett v. Teachers' &amp; State Employees' Retirement Sys. ex rel. Board of Trustees,

                        Retiree Not Entitled to Tax-Free Pension. - Retiree was not entitled to a tax free pension because he withdrew his contributions to the Consolidated Judicial Retirement System and the Teachers' and State Employees Retirement System and left public employment
                        before August 12, 1989, and thus he was not vested on that date; although the retiree later returned to public employment, became vested, and repaid the money he had previously withdrawn, when read together,

                        contributions in the retirement system had no rights to any benefits within the system except for the right to repay previously withdrawn contributions as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-4" target="_self">G.S. 135-4</a></cite>.
                        The repayment served only to increase the retiree's years of service creditable. Cashwell v. Dep't of State Treasurer, Ret. Sys. Div., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 675 S.E.2d 73 (2009).

                        Retirement System pension because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-5ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 135-5(f)</a></cite> did not have to be used as the basis for calculating his "earliest retirement" date;

                        Rule Making. - Retirement Systems Division of the Department of State Treasurer (Division) erred in invoicing a school employee or school board for contributions to the employee's retirement fund pursuant to a statutory cap factor because (1) the factor
                        was a rule not properly adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, and (2) the Division was a state agency not exempt from rule making requirements. Cabarrus Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Dep't of State Treasurer,

                        Board Without Power to Waive Statutory Deadlines. - The Board of Trustees of the Retirement System does not have discretionary power to extend or waive statutory deadlines for the reinstatement of a withdrawn account or for purchase of out-of-state service,
                        since a waiver would not be a rule or regulation to prevent injustice and inequality across the board but simply a waiver in a specific instance. In re Ford, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 569,

                    about retirement benefits was intended to be included among those records required to be maintained for public inspection by each department, agency, institution, commission, and bureau of the State and that as a result the Retirement
                    Systems Division of the Department of the State Treasurer makes that information available for public inspection and examination. The General Assembly finds that the interests of clarity require statutory language providing guidance

                    <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-1" target="_self">G.S. 135-1(5)</a></cite> for reasons other than a wrongfully denied promotional opportunity or wrongful demotion where the member is promoted or the demotion is reversed retroactively.

                <p>
                    Under such rules as the Board of Trustees shall adopt, the Retirement System shall report monthly to each employer a list of those members for whom the employer made a contribution to the Retirement System in the preceding month that are most likely to
                    require an additional employer contribution should they elect to retire in the following 12 months, if applicable. Reports received under this section shall not be public records. Employers or former employers in receipt of a report
                    under this section shall treat the report, and the information contained within that report, as confidential and as though it were still held by the Retirement System under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-6.1" target="_self">G.S. 135-6.1</a></cite>.

                <p>
                    In the event that an employer fails to submit payment of any required contributions or payments to the Retirement Systems Division, other than the one percent (1%) payment provided for in the first paragraph of this subdivision, within 90 days after the
                    date set by the Board of Trustees, the Board shall notify the State Treasurer of its intent to collect the delinquent contributions and other payments due to the Retirement Systems Division and request an interception of State appropriations
                    due to the participating employer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except as provided in this subdivision, upon notification by the Board of Trustees to the State Treasurer and the Office of State Budget and Management as to the default of the employer, the Office of State Budget and Management shall withhold from any
                    State appropriation due to that employer an amount equal to the sum of all delinquent contributions and other debts due to the Retirement Systems Division and shall transmit that amount to the Retirement Systems Division. For the purposes
                    of this subsection, the date set by the Board of Trustees for payment of the contribution-based benefit cap liability shall be 12 months after the member's effective date of retirement.

                        contributions computed as a set percentage of the employees' salaries, and with systematic employer contributions in accordance with formulas mandated by the retirement statutes, which include calculations by an actuary based on

                        This subsection applies to distributions and rollovers from the Plan. The Plan does not have mandatory distributions within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. With respect to distributions from the Plan and notwithstanding
                        any other provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this Article, a distributee (including, after December 31, 2006, a non-spouse beneficiary if that non-spouse beneficiary
                        elects a direct rollover only to an inherited traditional or Roth IRA as permitted under applicable federal law) may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible
                        rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. As used in this subsection, an "eligible retirement plan" means an individual retirement account described in
                        Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, on and after January 1, 2009, a Roth IRA, or a qualified trust described
                        in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. Effective on and after January 1, 2002, an eligible retirement plan also means an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the
                        Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately
                        account for amounts transferred into that plan from this Plan. As used in this subsection, a "direct rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. Provided, an eligible rollover
                        distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution shall not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially
                        equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary,
                        or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined
                        without regard to the exclusion for net realized appreciation with respect to employer securities). Effective as of January 1, 2002, and notwithstanding the exclusion of any after-tax portion from such a rollover distribution in
                        the preceding sentence, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. That portion
                        may be transferred, pursuant to applicable federal law, to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, to a qualified defined benefit plan, or to a qualified defined contribution
                        plan described in Section 401(a), 403(a), or 403(b) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income
                        and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate
                        payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a court-ordered equitable distribution of marital property, as provided under G.S. 50-20.1. Effective on and after
                        January 1, 2007, notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a nonspouse beneficiary of a deceased member may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator of the Board of Trustees of this Retirement
                        System, to directly roll over any portion of the beneficiary's distribution from the Retirement System; however, such rollover shall conform with the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Code.

                        Medical Child Support Enforcement Provisions. - The medical child support enforcement provisions of House Bill 1563, 1993 (Reg. Sess. 1994) N.C. Session Laws c. 644, are inapplicable to the North Carolina Teachers' and State Employees' Comprehensive Major

                    State Employees. One purpose of the audit is to determine whether savings to the Plan and to Plan members could be achieved if claims payments and processing were more efficiently and effectively administered. The audit shall encompass
                    Plan years beginning in 2005, or earlier, through 2008 and shall look at claims administration and payment under the former Indemnity Plan as compared to the present PPO Plan. In developing the RFP, the Executive Administrator shall

                    It is the intent of the General Assembly that active employees and retired employees covered under the Plan and its successor Plan shall have several opportunities in each fiscal year to attend presentations conducted by Plan management staff providing
                    detailed information about benefits, limitations, premiums, co-payments, and other pertinent Plan matters. To this end, the Plan's management staff shall conduct multiple presentations each year to Plan members and association groups
                    representing active and retired employees across all geographic regions of the State. Regional meetings shall be held in locations that afford reasonably convenient access to Plan members. The presentations shall be designed not only
                    to present information about the Plan but also to hear and respond to Plan members' questions and concerns.

       Open Enrollment - Contributory Death Benefit.
      </b> - Session Laws 2007-388, s. 1, provides: "Notwithstanding any section of law or any rules and regulations adopted by the Boards of Trustees to the contrary, the Retirement Systems Division of the Department of State Treasurer
                    shall allow for an open enrollment period in the Contributory Death Benefit for Retired Members of the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System, the Local Governmental Employees' Retirement System, the Consolidated Judicial
                    Retirement System, and the Legislative Retirement System. This open enrollment period shall begin February 1, 2008, and end May 31, 2008. The Retirement Systems Division shall send notice by U.S. mail of the open enrollment period
                    to all retirees who elected not to be covered under this benefit or who failed to make any election at the time of their retirement and shall send a second notice by U.S. mail to any such retiree who fails to make an election within
                    60 days of the notification of the open enrollment period. Notice, at minimum, shall consist of notification of the open enrollment period and the consequences of failure to respond within the specified time frames, informational materials
                    explaining the benefit program and the associated costs, and a preprinted personalized enrollment application to facilitate the enrollment process indicating each individual retiree's contribution rate. The contribution rate for retirees
                    electing coverage during the open enrollment period shall be increased by eleven and one-tenth percent (11.1%) the rate established for retirees who elected coverage when first eligible, at retirement. For retirees electing coverage
                    during this open enrollment period, coverage shall become effective the first of the month following the month in which the election of coverage is received by the Retirement Systems Division but not before February 1, 2008. Contribution
                    rates for coverage shall be based upon the retiree's nearest age as of the effective date of coverage and shall begin by deduction from the retiree's net monthly retirement allowance in the month in which coverage becomes effective.
                    Coverage elected by retirees during this open enrollment period shall be subject to all other laws and rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees governing the Contributory Death Benefit for Retired Members."

                    public defenders, the Director of Indigent Defense Services, and clerks of superior court of the General Court of Justice of North Carolina, and their survivors. This Retirement System is a governmental plan, within the meaning of
                    Section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, the nondiscrimination rules of Sections 401(a)(5) and 401(a)(26) of the Code do not apply. The Retirement System so created shall be established as of January 1, 1974.

                    The Retirement System shall have the power and privileges of a corporation and shall be known as the "Consolidated Judicial Retirement System of North Carolina," and by such name all of its business shall be transacted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consistent with Section 401(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, all contributions from participating employers and participating employees to this Retirement System shall be made to funds held in trust through trust instruments that have the purposes
                    of distributing trust principal and income to retired members and their beneficiaries and of paying other definitely determinable benefits under this Chapter, after meeting the necessary expenses of administering this Retirement System.
                    Neither the trust corpus nor income from this trust can be used for purposes other than the exclusive benefit of members or their beneficiaries, except that employer contributions made to the trust under a good faith mistake of fact
                    may be returned to an employer, where the refund can occur within less than one year after the mistaken contribution was made, consistent with the rule adopted by the Board of Trustees. The Retirement System shall have a consolidated
                    Plan document, consisting of relevant statutory provisions in this Chapter, associated regulations in the North Carolina Administrative Code, substantive and procedural information on the official forms used by the Retirement System,
                    and policies and minutes of the Board of Trustees.

                    creditable service for periods of federal employment, provided that the member is not receiving any retirement benefits resulting from this federal employment, and provided that the member is not vested in the particular federal retirement
                    system to which the member may have belonged while a federal employee. The member, after the transfer of any accumulated contributions from the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System or Local Governmental Employees' Retirement
                    System, shall pay an amount equal to the full cost of the service credits calculated on the basis of the assumptions used for purposes of the actuarial valuation of the Retirement System's liabilities, taking into account the additional
                    retirement allowance arising on account of the additional service credits commencing at the earliest age at which the member could retire with an unreduced retirement allowance as determined by the Board of Trustees upon the advice
                    of the consulting actuary, plus an administrative fee as set by the Board of Trustees. As an alternative to transferring any accumulated contributions from the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System or the Local Governmental
                    Employees' Retirement System to the Consolidated Judicial Retirement System, a member may irrevocably elect to transfer these contributions to the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan of North Carolina as determined by the Plan's Board

                        this percentage change is positive. Should the earning capacity of the disability beneficiary later change, the portion of his disability retirement allowance not provided by his contributions may be further modified. In lieu of
                        the reductions on account of a disability beneficiary earning more than the aforesaid difference, he may elect to convert his disability retirement allowance to a service retirement allowance calculated on the basis of his final
                        compensation and creditable service at the time of disability retirement and his age at the time of conversion to service retirement. This election is irrevocable.

                        This subsection applies to distributions and rollovers from the Plan. The Plan does not have mandatory distributions within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. With respect to distributions from the Plan and notwithstanding
                        any other provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this Article, a distributee (including, after December 31, 2006, a non-spouse beneficiary if that non-spouse beneficiary
                        elects a direct rollover only to an inherited traditional or Roth IRA as permitted under applicable federal law) may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible
                        rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. As used in this subsection, an "eligible retirement plan" means an individual retirement account described in
                        Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, on and after January 1, 2009, a Roth IRA, or a qualified trust described
                        in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. Effective on and after January 1, 2002, an eligible retirement plan also means an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the
                        Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately
                        account for amounts transferred into that plan from this Plan. As used in this subsection, a "direct rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. Provided, an eligible rollover
                        distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution shall not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially
                        equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary,
                        or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined
                        without regard to the exclusion for net realized appreciation with respect to employer securities). Effective as of January 1, 2002, and notwithstanding the exclusion of any after-tax portion from such a rollover distribution in
                        the preceding sentence, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. That portion
                        may be transferred, pursuant to applicable federal law, to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, to a qualified defined benefit plan, or to a qualified defined contribution
                        plan described in Section 401(a), 403(a), or 403(b) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income
                        and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate
                        payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a court-ordered equitable distribution of marital property, as provided under G.S. 50-20.1. Effective on and after
                        January 1, 2007, notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a nonspouse beneficiary of a deceased member may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator of the Board of Trustees of this Retirement
                        System, to directly roll over any portion of the beneficiary's distribution from the Retirement System; however, such rollover shall conform with the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Code.

                    from time to time, subject to certain federal grandfathering rules.

                    the Internal Revenue Code and any regulations issued under the Code. However, with respect to a person who became a member of the Retirement System prior to January 1, 1996, the imposition of this limitation on compensation shall not
                    reduce the amount of compensation which may be taken into account for determining the benefits of that member under this Article below the amount of compensation which would have been recognized under the provisions of this Article

                    2001, shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) or the amount otherwise set by the Internal Revenue Code or determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as the limitation for calendar years after 2002.

                        as a form of long-term disability payments, and because claimant was disabled prior to his termination, the trial court correctly ordered that claimant be compensated for the additional annual leave he would have accrued had he

                        was delayed due to the employers' miscalculation of the end of the 180-day filing period. However, in no instance shall the filing period be extended beyond an additional 180 days.

                        participant had exhausted the leave and shall be in lieu of any long-term benefit otherwise payable. Provided that, in any event, a beneficiary's benefit shall be reduced during the first 36 months of the long-term disability period
                        by an amount, as determined by the Board of Trustees, equal to a primary Social Security retirement benefit to which the beneficiary might be entitled, effective as of the first of the month following the month of initial entitlement.

                        During the long-term disability period, a beneficiary may return to service for trial rehabilitation for periods of not greater than 36 months of continuous service. Such return will not cause the beneficiary to become a participant and will not require

                    by the Board of Trustees. If the Medical Board finds that a beneficiary is no longer mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, the Medical Board shall so certify this finding to the Board of Trustees,
                    and the Board of Trustees may terminate the beneficiary's long-term disability benefits effective on the last day of the month in which the Medical Board certifies that the beneficiary is no longer disabled.

                    As to the requirement of five years of membership service, any participant or beneficiary who does not have five years of membership service within the 96 calendar months prior to conclusion of the short-term disability period or cessation of salary continuation
                    payments, whichever is later, shall not be eligible for long-term disability benefits.

                    Notwithstanding the requirement that the incapacity was incurred at the time of active employment, any participant who becomes disabled while on an employer approved leave of absence and who is eligible for and in receipt of temporary total benefits under
                    The North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act, Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.097.html" target="_blank">Chapter 97</a></cite> of the General Statutes, will be eligible for all benefits
                    provided under this Article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 36 months of long-term disability, no further benefits are payable under the terms of this section unless the member has been approved and is in receipt of primary Social Security disability benefits. In that case the benefits payable shall be equal
                    to sixty-five percent (65%) of 1/12th of the annual base rate of compensation last payable to the participant or beneficiary prior to the beginning of the short-term disability period as may be adjusted for percentage increases as
                    provided under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a06s135-108" target="_self">G.S. 135-108</a></cite>, plus sixty-five percent (65%) of 1/12th of the annual longevity payment to which the participant or beneficiary
                    would be eligible, to a maximum of three thousand nine hundred dollars ($3,900) per month reduced by the primary Social Security disability benefits to which the beneficiary may be entitled, effective as of the first of the month following
                    the month of initial entitlement, and by monthly payments for Workers' Compensation to which the participant or beneficiary may be entitled. When primary Social Security disability benefits are increased by cost-of-living adjustments,
                    the increased reduction shall be applied in the first month following the month in which the member becomes entitled to the increased Social Security benefit. The monthly benefit shall be further reduced by the amount of any monthly
                    payments from the federal Department of Veterans Affairs, for payments from any other federal agency, or for any payments made under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.127A.html#t127Aa08s127A-108" target="_blank">G.S. 127A-108</a></cite>,
                    to which the participant or beneficiary may be entitled on account of the same disability. Provided, in any event, the benefit payable shall be no less than ten dollars ($10.00) a month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the long-term disability benefit is payable so long as the beneficiary is disabled and is in receipt of a primary Social Security disability benefit until the earliest date at which the beneficiary is eligible for an unreduced
                    service retirement allowance from the Retirement System, at which time the beneficiary would receive a retirement allowance calculated on the basis of the beneficiary's average final compensation at the time of disability as adjusted
                    to reflect compensation increases subsequent to the time of disability and the creditable service accumulated by the beneficiary, including creditable service while in receipt of benefits under the Plan. In the event the beneficiary
                    has not been approved and is not in receipt of a primary Social Security disability benefit, the long-term disability benefit shall cease after the first 36 months of the long-term disability period. When such a long-term disability
                    recipient begins receiving this unreduced service retirement allowance from the System, that recipient shall not be subject to the six-month waiting period set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a01s135-1" target="_self">G.S. 135-1(20)</a></cite>.
                    However, a beneficiary shall be entitled to a restoration of the long-term disability benefit in the event the Social Security Administration grants a retroactive approval for primary Social Security disability benefits with a benefit
                    effective date within the first 36 months of the long-term disability period. In such event, the long-term disability benefit shall be restored retroactively to the date of cessation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A beneficiary who, during a period of trial rehabilitation, is unable to continue in service may be entitled to a restoration of the long-term disability benefit provided that the Medical Board certifies that the beneficiary is disabled in accordance
                    with the laws in effect at the time of the Board's original approval for long-term disability benefits, either due to the same or a different incapacity, notwithstanding the requirement the incapacity has been continuous. In the event
                    that the Medical Board determines that the long-term disability benefit should be restored, the restored benefit should be calculated in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a06s135-106ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 135-106(b)</a></cite>;
                    should include any post-disability benefit adjustments as provided by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a06s135-108" target="_self">G.S. 135-108</a></cite>; and shall continue as long as the beneficiary remains disabled until the beneficiary
                    has received a total of 36 long-term disability payments. Continuation of long-term disability benefit payments beyond 36 total payments shall be dependent upon approval for primary Social Security disability benefits as required by
                    <cite class="octn"><a href="#t135a06s135-106ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 135-106(b)</a></cite>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A beneficiary who returns to service for a period of trial rehabilitation and who has continued in service for greater than 36 continuous months shall again become a participant, and any subsequent incapacity shall be treated as a new incapacity causing
                    a new waiting period to begin. Such a beneficiary may be entitled to additional long-term disability benefits on account of the new incapacity provided the beneficiary meets all other requirements notwithstanding the requirement of
                    five years of membership service within the 96 calendar months prior to becoming disabled or the cessation of continuous salary continuation payments.

                        Entitlement to Attorney Fees. - Since former employee's attorney has a right superior as against employee to the attorney's fee and since attorney must claim her fee directly from the Social Security Administration (SSA), employee was not entitled within

                        Salary Continuation as a Form of Long-Term Disability. - Because claimant had submitted an application for long-term disability and requested that he remain on the payroll until his accrued leave was exhausted, his request was sufficient exercise of his
                        right to take salary continuation as a form of long-term disability payments, and because claimant was disabled prior to his termination, the trial court correctly ordered that claimant be compensated for the additional annual
                        leave he would have accrued had he stayed on salary continuation through the end of his accrued annual leave. Williams v. North Carolina Dep't of Economic &amp; Community Dev., <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite>                        535, 458 S.E.2d 750 (1995).

                <p>
                    Only for the purpose of determining eligibility for benefits accruing under this Article, membership service standing to the credit of a member of the Legislative Retirement System or the Consolidated Judicial Retirement System shall be added to the membership
                    service standing to the credit of a member of the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System. However, in the event that a participant or beneficiary is a retired member of the Legislative Retirement System or the Consolidated
                    Judicial Retirement System whose retirement benefit was suspended upon entrance into membership in the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System, such membership service standing to the credit of the retired member prior to
                    retirement shall be likewise counted. Membership service under this section shall not be counted twice for the same period of time.

                        The Qualified Excess Benefit Arrangement (QEBA) is established effective January 1, 2014, and placed under the management of the Board of Trustees. The purpose of the QEBA is solely to provide the part of a retirement allowance or benefit that would otherwise
                        have been payable by a Retirement System except for the limitations under section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The QEBA, as set forth in this Article, is intended to constitute a qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement

                        January 1, 2014, from the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System that is reduced due to the application of the maximum benefit provisions of section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of the QEBA, a payee
                        is a retired member or survivor beneficiary of a member or retired member who is receiving monthly retirement benefit payments from a Retirement System.

                        benefit paid under the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System on and after January 1, 2014, and the amount that would have been payable to that payee from the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System in that month

                        benefit payable under the Retirement System. A payee cannot elect to defer the receipt of all or any part of the supplemental payments due under the QEBA. The supplemental benefit paid under this section shall be taxable under
                        North Carolina law in the same manner as the benefit paid under the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System.

                        actuary engaged by the Board of Trustees, shall determine the employer contributions required to pay the benefits due under the QEBA for each fiscal year. The required contributions shall be paid by all participating employers.
                        The required contributions shall be deposited in a separate fund from the fund into which regular employer contributions are deposited for the Retirement System. The benefit liability for the QEBA shall be determined each fiscal

                        reimbursement amount shall be calculated on an annual basis every calendar year. For purposes of calculating the reimbursement amount, the Board of Trustees may include a pro rata share of direct costs attributable to administration
