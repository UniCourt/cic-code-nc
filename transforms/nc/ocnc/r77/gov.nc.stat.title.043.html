                        Chapter to Be Liberally Construed. - This statute is of a remedial character, and should be liberally construed according to its intent. Cape Lookout Co. v. Gold, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 63</cite>, 83 S.E. 3 (1914); Dillon
                        v. Brocker, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 65</cite>, 100 S.E. 191 (1919); Perry v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 377</cite>, 14 S.E.2d 46 (1941).

                    <p>
                        The Torrens Act manifests a purpose on the part of the General Assembly to establish a title in the registered owner, impregnable against attack at the time of the decree, and also to protect him against all claims or demands not noted on the book for
                        the registration of titles, and to make that book a complete record and the only conclusive evidence of the title. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 371 (1971).

                    <p>
                        The basic principle of this system is the registration of the official and conclusive evidence of the title of land, instead of registering, as the old system requires, the wholly private and inconclusive evidences of such title. State v. Johnson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 371 (1971).

        The purpose of a proceeding under the Torrens Law
       </b> is to remove clouds from title and resolve controversies with regard thereto, not to validate title to lands which under the law of the State, which everyone is presumed to know, are not subject to private ownership.

                    <p>
                        The general purpose of the Torrens System is to secure by a decree of court, or other similar proceedings, a title impregnable against attack; to make a permanent and complete record of the exact status of the title, with the certificate of registration
                        showing at a glance all liens, encumbrances, and claims against the title; and to protect the registered owner against all claims or demands not noted on the book for the registration of titles. State v. Johnson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 371 (1971).

                        The judge of the superior court is given authority over the whole proceedings before the clerk, and may require reformation of the process, pleadings or decrees or entries, and therefore he has authority to allow parties defendant to be made and to enlarge
                        the time within which answers may be filed. Empire Mfg. Co. v. Spruill, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 618</cite>, 86 S.E. 522 (1915).

                        in accordance with the terms of an unassailed judgment to which plaintiff was a party, and ascertained by a consent reference. Harrison v. Darden, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 364</cite>, 26 S.E.2d 860

                    part thereof is situated, and the same shall be there filed and recorded; and every such register of deeds, upon demand of the person entitled and payment of requisite fees therefor, shall issue and deliver a certificate of title for

                        Attack on Proceedings Because Clerk Did Not Sign Jurat. - Where petitioner seeking to have his title to land registered under the provisions of the Torrens Law signed an oath reciting that he had been duly sworn, he could not contend that the oath lacked
                        validity on grounds that the clerk of the court had not signed the jurat, and that in consequence the proceedings which followed were absolutely void, and thereafter, upon his own motion, have such proceedings set aside. Morgan

                </h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to the summons issued, prescribed in the foregoing section [§ 43-9], the clerk of the court shall, at the time of issuing such summons, publish a notice of the filing thereof containing the names of the petitioners, the names of all persons
                    named in the petition, together with a short but accurate description of the land and the relief demanded, in some secular newspaper published in the county wherein the land is situate, and having general circulation in the county;
                    and if there be no such paper, then in a newspaper in the county nearest thereto and having general circulation in the county wherein the land lies, once a week for eight issues of such paper. The notice shall set forth the title of
                    the cause and in legible or conspicuous type the words "To whom it may concern," and shall give notice to all persons of the relief demanded and the return day of the summons: Provided, that no final order or judgment shall be entered
                    in the cause until there is proof and adjudication of publication as in other cases of publication of notice of summons. The provisions of this section, in respect to the issuing and service of summons and the publication of the notice,
                    shall be mandatory and essential to the jurisdiction of the court to proceed in the cause: Provided, that the recital of the service of summons and publication in the decree or in the final judgment in the cause, and in the certificate
                    issued to the petitioner as hereinafter provided, shall be conclusive evidence thereof. The clerk of the court shall also record a copy of said notice in the lis pendens docket of his office and cross-index same as other notices of
                    lis pendens and shall also certify a copy thereof to the superior court of each county in which any part of said land lies, and the clerk thereof shall record and cross-index same in the lis pendens records of his office as other notices
                    of lis pendens are recorded and cross-indexed.

                        Sufficiency of Short Form of Description. - Where notice is required to contain a short form of description of the property, it is sufficient if it clearly calls the attention of adjoining owners or others who might be interested to the particular property
                        intended, and it need not contain all the elements of a full description. Richmond Cedar Works v. Farmers Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 254 S.E.2d 673 (1979).

                        Reference to County Public Registry for Description Held Insufficient. - Where a notice published in a county newspaper under this section simply stated where in the county public registry a description of the land in question could be found, the notice
                        by publication was inadequate to give the notice required by statute. Richmond Cedar Works v. Farmers Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 254 S.E.2d 673 (1979).

                        Sufficiency of Publication. - Where the summons in proceedings to register lands has been issued and served under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43a03s43-9" target="_self">G.S. 43-9</a></cite>, it is not necessary
                        to the validity of the proceedings that the publication of notice of filing should have been made on exactly the day the summons was issued, if the publication has been made in the designated paper once a week for eight successive
                        weeks as directed by this section. Cape Lookout Co. v. Gold, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 63</cite>, 83 S.E. 3 (1914).

                    <p>
                        Conclusive Evidence of Publication. - The recital in a final Torrens decree of registration that "publication of notice has been duly made" is conclusive evidence of the fact, and any attack on the decree is foreclosed by the limitation imposed in

                    <p>
                        When viewed in light of the purpose of the Torrens Act, it is clear that the proviso that recital of service of summons and publication in the decree and the certificate shall be conclusive evidence thereof is intended to cure any jurisdictional defect
                        with respect to issuance and service of summons and the publication of notice so as to foreclose all jurisdictional attacks on a Torrens title. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>,

                    by anyone having any estate or interest in the land, or any part thereof, the title to which has been registered under the terms of this Chapter, attaching thereto the registered certificate of title issued to the deceased holder and
                    setting forth the nature and character of the interest or estate of such petitioner in said land, the manner in which such interest or estate was acquired by the petitioner from the deceased person - whether by descent, by will, or
                    otherwise, and setting forth the names and addresses of any and all other persons, firms or corporations which may have any interest or estate therein, or any part thereof, and the names and addresses of all persons known to have any
                    claims or liens against the said land; and setting forth the changes which are necessary to be made in the registered certificate of title to land in order to show the true owner or owners thereof occasioned by the death of the registered
                    owner of said certificate. Such petition shall contain all such other information as is necessary to fully inform the court as to the status of the title and the condition as to all liens and encumbrances against said land existing
                    at the time the petition is filed, and shall contain a prayer for such relief as the petitioner may be entitled to under the provisions hereof. Such petition shall be duly verified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like procedure may be followed as herein set forth upon the dissolution of any corporation which is the registered owner of any estate or interest in the land which has been brought under this Chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event the registered certificate of title has been lost and after due diligence cannot be found, and this fact is made to appear by allegation in the petition, such registered certificate of title need not be attached to the petition as hereinabove
                    required, but the legal representatives of the deceased registered owner shall be made parties to the proceeding. If such persons are unknown or, if known cannot after due diligence be found within the State, service of summons upon
                    them may be made by publication of the notice prescribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43a04s43-17.2" target="_self">G.S. 43-17.2</a></cite>. In case the registered owner is a corporation which has been dissolved,
                    service of summons upon such corporation and any others who may have or claim any interest in such land thereunder shall be made by publication of the notice containing appropriate recitals as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43a04s43-17.2" target="_self">G.S. 43-17.2</a></cite>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If any registered owner has by writing conveyed or attempted to convey a title to any registered land without the surrender of the certificate of title issued to him, the person claiming title to said lands under and through said registered owner by reason
                    of his or its conveyance may file a petition with the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the land is registered and in the proceeding under which the title was registered praying for the cancellation of the original
                    certificate and the issuance of the new certificate. Upon the filing of such petition notice shall be published as prescribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43a04s43-17.2" target="_self">G.S. 43-17.2</a></cite>.
                    The clerk of the superior court with whom said petition is filed shall by order determine what additional notice, if any, shall be given to registered owners. If the registered owner is a natural person, deceased, or a corporation
                    dissolved the court may direct what additional notice, if any, shall be given. The clerk shall hear the evidence, make findings of fact, and if found as a fact that the original certificate of the registered owner has been lost and
                    cannot be found, shall enter his order directing the register of deeds to cancel the same and to issue a new certificate to such person or persons as may be entitled thereto, subject to such claims or liens as the court may find to
                    exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any party within 10 days from the rendition of such judgment or order by the clerk of superior court of the county in which said land is registered may appeal to the superior court during a session of court, where the cause shall be heard de novo by the
                    judge, unless a jury trial be demanded, in which event the issues of fact shall be submitted to a jury. From any order or judgment entered by the superior court during a session of court an appeal may be taken to the appellate division
                    in the manner provided by law.

                    voluntary or involuntary transaction shall affect the title to registered lands until registered in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter: Provided, that all mortgages, deeds, surrendered and canceled certificates, when new
                    certificates are issued for the land so deeded, the other paper-writings, if any, pertaining to and affecting the registered estate or estates herein referred to, shall be filed by the register of deeds for reference and information,
                    but the consolidated real property records shall be and constitute sole and conclusive legal evidence of title, except in cases of mistake and fraud, which shall be corrected in the methods now provided for the correction of papers

                        No Distinction Between Original Parties and Creditors or Purchasers. - The statute draws no distinction between the original parties to deeds or contracts affecting the title of lands registered under its provisions and creditors or purchasers, and in
                        respect to such registration they stand upon the same footing. Dillon v. Broeker, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 65</cite>, 100 S.E. 191 (1919).

                    thereof in the words following, or words of similar import, to wit: "I (or we),..............., being the owner (or owners) of the registered estate evidenced by this certificate of title, do hereby release said estate from the provisions

                    the register of deeds of the county in which such decree was rendered or certificate of title thereon was issued, a verified statement in writing, setting forth fully the right, title, or interest so claimed, how or from whom it was
                    acquired, and a reference to the number, book, and page of the certificate of title of the registered owner, together with a description of the land by metes and bounds, the adverse claimant's place of residence and his post-office
                    address, and, if a nonresident, he shall designate or appoint the said register of deeds to receive all notices directed to or to be served upon such adverse claimant in connection with the claim by him made, and such statement shall
                    be noted and filed by said register of deeds as an adverse claim; but no action or proceeding to enforce such adverse claim shall be maintained unless the same be commenced within six months of the filing of the statement thereof.

                <p>
                    Any registered owner or other claimant under the registered title may at any time apply to the court in which the original decree was entered, by petition, setting out that registered interests of any description, whether vested, contingent, expectant
                    or inchoate, have terminated and ceased, or that new interests have arisen or been created which do not appear upon the certificate, or that any error or omission was made in entering or issuing the certificate or any duplicate thereof,
                    or that the name of any person on the certificate has been changed, or that the registered owner had married or, if registered as married, that the marriage has been terminated, or that a corporation which owned registered lands has
                    been dissolved, without conveying the same or transferring its certificate within three years after the dissolution, or any other reasonable and proper ground of correction or relief; and such court may hear and determine the petition
                    after notice to all parties in interest, and may make such order or decree as may be appropriate and lawful in the premises; but nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize any such court to open any original decree of
                    registration which was entered more than 12 months prior to the filing of such petition, and nothing shall be done or ordered by the court to divest or impair the title or other interest of a purchaser who holds a transfer or certificate
                    of title for value and in good faith. No action or proceeding shall be commenced or maintained to set up or establish any right, claim, interest or estate adverse to the order or decree or certificate of title issued thereon made or
                    entered upon any petition or other proceeding authorized by this section, unless the same shall be brought and instituted within six months from the date of such order or decree authorized by this section.

                    Upon presentation to the register of deeds of an instrument of transfer or conveyance of an undivided interest in a registered estate, in proper form as above prescribed, it shall be his duty to cancel the certificate of title attached thereto and to
                    issue to each owner a new certificate of title, each bearing the same number as the original certificate of title and accurately specifying and describing the extent and the amount of the interest retained or of the interest transferred,
                    as the case may be. Upon presentation to the register of deeds of an instrument of transfer or conveyance of a separate lot or parcel of a registered estate, in proper form as above prescribed, it shall be his duty to cancel the certificate
                    of the title attached thereto and to issue to each owner a new certificate of title bearing a new number and describing the separate lot or parcel retained or transferred, as the case may be, either by metes and bounds or by reference
                    to a map or plat thereto attached. The register of deeds is responsible for determining that each new certificate of title contains a description of the property transferred or retained but not for verifying the accuracy of any description.

                        Negligence of Mortgagee Barring Recovery. - A proceeding under this chapter, duly commenced prior to the enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Va11s1-117" target="_blank">G.S. 1-117</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Va11s1-118" target="_blank">G.S. 1-118</a></cite>, constituted a "lis pendens." Such proceeding, while pending, was notice to a mortgagee of the land without the necessity
                        of the filing of a formal lis pendens, and where the mortgagee failed to protect himself under the provisions of the statute, and the title to the land was assured by the State, and a holder thereof by proper transfer acquired
                        the title, the negligence of the mortgagee was a complete defense in the mortgagee's action to recover damages against the State thereunder. Brinson v. Lacy, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 394</cite>, 142 S.E. 317 (1928).
