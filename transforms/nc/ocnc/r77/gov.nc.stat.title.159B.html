     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly hereby finds and determines that:
     </p>
     <p>
      A critical situation exists with respect to the present and future supply of electric power and energy in the State of North Carolina;
     </p>
     <p>
      The public utilities operating in the State have sustained greatly increased capital and operating costs;
     </p>
     <p>
      Such public utilities have found it necessary to postpone or curtail construction of planned generation and transmission facilities serving the consumers of electricity in the State, increasing the ultimate cost of such facilities to the public utilities, and that such postponements and curtailments will have an adverse effect on the provision of adequate and reliable electric service in the State;
     </p>
     <p>
      The above conditions have occurred despite substantial increases in electric rates;
     </p>
     <p>
      In the absence of further material increases in electric rates, additional postponements and curtailments in the construction of additional generation and transmission facilities may occur, thereby impairing those utilities' ability to continue to provide an adequate and reliable source of electric power and energy in the State;
     </p>
     <p>
      Seventy-two municipalities in the State have for many years owned and operated systems for the distribution of electric power and energy to customers in their respective service areas and are empowered severally to engage in the generation and transmission of electric power and energy;
     </p>
     <p>
      Such municipalities owning electric distribution systems have an obligation to provide their inhabitants and customers an adequate, reliable and economical source of electric power and energy in the future;
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to achieve the economies and efficiencies made possible by the proper planning, financing, sizing and location of facilities for the generation and transmission of electric power and energy which are not practical for any municipality acting alone, and to insure an adequate, reliable and economical supply of electric power and energy to the people of the State, it is desirable for the State of North Carolina to authorize municipal electric systems to jointly plan, finance, develop, own and operate electric generation and transmission facilities appropriate to their needs in order to provide for their present and future power requirements for all uses without supplanting or displacing the service at retail of other electric suppliers operating in the State; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The joint planning, financing, development, ownership and operation of electric generation and transmission facilities by municipalities which own electric distribution systems and the issuance of revenue bonds for such purposes as provided in this Chapter is for a public use and for public and municipal purposes and is a means of achieving economies, adequacy and reliability in the generation of electric power and energy and in the meeting of future needs of the State and its inhabitants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Municipal electric systems that have jointly planned, developed, acquired, owned, and financed electric generation and transmission facilities through joint agencies in furtherance of the purposes of this Chapter also may benefit from obtaining their power and energy requirements from replacement resources, the disposition of facilities owned by joint agencies, and the issuance by joint agencies of bonds to refinance the outstanding debt incurred with respect to facilities to the extent outstanding debt cannot be completely defeased in connection with the disposition of the facilities, and it is desirable for the State of North Carolina to facilitate the foregoing. Refinancing debt, and financing any collateral posting requirements incident to replacement power and energy resources that may be acquired, by the issuance of revenue bonds secured by payments by municipal electric systems, is for a public use and for a public and municipal purpose and is an alternative means, together with the disposition of the jointly owned facilities and acquisition of replacement sources of power and energy, of achieving economies, adequacy and reliability of electric power and energy supply, and in meeting the future needs of the State and its inhabitants.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the authority granted municipalities to jointly plan, finance, develop, own and operate electric generation and transmission facilities by Article 2 of this Chapter and the other powers granted in said Article 2, and in addition and supplemental to powers otherwise conferred on municipalities by the laws of this State for interlocal cooperation, it is desirable for the State of North Carolina to authorize municipalities and joint agencies to form joint municipal assistance agencies which shall be empowered to provide aid and assistance to municipalities in the construction, ownership, maintenance, expansion and operation of their electric systems, and to empower joint agencies authorized herein to provide aid and assistance to municipalities or joint municipal assistance agencies in the development and implementation of integrated resource planning, including, but not limited to, the evaluation of resources, generating facilities, alternative energy resources, conservation and load management programs, transmission and distribution facilities, and purchase power options, and in the development, construction and operation of supply-side and demand-side resources, in addition to exercising such other powers as hereinafter provided to joint municipal assistance agencies and joint agencies. In order to provide maximum economies and efficiencies to municipalities and the consuming public in the generation and transmission of electric power and energy contemplated by Article 2 of this Chapter, it is also desirable that the joint municipal assistance agencies authorized herein be empowered to act as provided in Article 3 of this Chapter and that such agency or agencies be empowered to act for and on behalf of any one or more municipalities or joint agencies, as requested, with respect to the construction, ownership, maintenance, expansion and operation of their electric systems; and that the joint agencies authorized herein be empowered to act as provided in Article 2 of this Chapter and that such joint agencies be empowered to act for and on behalf of any one or more municipalities or joint municipal assistance agencies, in each case as requested, with respect to the integrated resource planning and development, construction, and operation of supply-side and demand-side options described above.

       § 159B-4. Authority of municipalities to jointly cooperate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition and supplemental to the powers otherwise conferred on municipalities by the laws of the State, and in order to accomplish the purposes of this Chapter and to obtain a supply of electric power and energy for the present and future needs of its inhabitants and customers, a municipality may jointly or severally plan, finance, develop, construct, reconstruct, acquire, improve, enlarge, better, own, operate and maintain a project situated within or without the State with one or more other municipalities or joint agencies created pursuant to this Chapter or, in the case of projects for the generation and transmission of electric power and energy, jointly with any persons, firms, associations or corporations, public or private, engaged in the generation, transmission or distribution of electric power and energy for resale within this State or any state contiguous to the State, and may make such plans and enter into such contracts in connection therewith, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter, as are necessary or appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to acquiring any generation project the governing board shall determine the needs of the municipality for power and energy based upon engineering studies and reports, and shall not acquire a project in excess of that amount of capacity and the energy associated therewith required to provide for its projected needs for power and energy from and after the date the project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous operation and for such reasonable period of time thereafter as shall be determined by the governing board and approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission in a proceeding instituted pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t159Ba02s159B-24" target="_self">G.S. 159B-24</a></cite>. In determining the future power requirements of a municipality, there shall be taken into account the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-4ol11">
       The economies and efficiencies to be achieved in constructing on a large scale facilities for the generation of electric power and energy;
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-4ol12">
       The municipality's needs for reserve and peaking capacity and to meet obligations under pooling and reserve sharing agreements reasonably related to its needs for power and energy to which it is or may become a party;
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-4ol13">
       The estimated useful life of such project;
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-4ol14">
       The estimated time necessary for the planning, development, acquisition or construction of such project and the length of time required in advance to obtain, acquire or construct additional power supply; and
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-4ol15">
       The reliability and availability of existing or alternative power supply sources and the cost of such existing or alternative power supply sources.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A determination by such governing board approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission based upon appropriate findings of the foregoing matters shall be conclusive as to the quantity of the interest which a municipality may acquire in a generation project unless a party to the proceeding aggrieved by the determination of said Commission shall file notice of appeal pursuant to Article 5 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.062.html" target="_blank">Chapter 62</a></cite> of the General Statutes of North Carolina.

The acquisition of a project shall include, but shall not be limited to, the purchase or lease of an existing, completed project and the purchase of a project under construction. A municipality participating in the joint or several planning, financing, construction, reconstruction, acquisition, improvement, enlargement, betterment, ownership, operation or maintenance of any project under this Chapter may furnish money derived solely from the proceeds of bonds or from the ownership and operation of its electric system, or both, and provide property, both real and personal, services and other considerations.

Any municipality may withdraw from a joint agency, provided, however, that all contractual rights acquired and obligations incurred while a municipality was a member shall remain in full force and effect.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-9ol1c">
       The powers of a joint agency shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of a joint agency shall be managed under the direction of, its board of commissioners. However, all or a portion of those powers and the management of all or any part of the business and affairs of a joint agency may be exercised by an executive committee created pursuant to G.S. 159B-10. The board of commissioners shall consist of commissioners appointed by the respective governing boards of the municipalities which are members of the joint agency. Each commissioner shall have not less than one vote and may have in addition thereto such additional votes as the governing boards of a majority of the municipalities which are members of the agency shall determine. Each commissioner shall serve at the pleasure of the governing board by which the commissioner was appointed. Each appointed commissioner before entering upon his duties shall take and subscribe to an oath before some person authorized by law to administer oaths to execute the duties of his office faithfully and impartially, and a record of each such oath shall be filed with the governing board of the appointing municipality and spread upon its minutes. The governing board of each of the municipalities may appoint up to two alternate commissioners to act in lieu of its appointed commissioner when the appointed commissioner is unable for any reason to attend meetings of the board of commissioners or any committee thereof, and the governing board shall designate them as first or second alternate commissioner. Each alternate commissioner shall serve at the pleasure of the governing body by which that commissioner was appointed and shall take, subscribe to and file an oath in the same manner as prescribed for regularly appointed commissioners. Such alternate commissioner when acting in lieu of the regularly appointed commissioner shall be deemed to be the commissioner of such municipality, and shall have the rights, powers and authority of the regularly appointed commissioner, including any committee function of said commissioner, other than such commissioner's position as an officer pursuant to paragraph (d) of this G.S. 159B-9. A certificate entered into the minutes of the board of commissioners of a joint agency by the clerk or other custodian of the minutes and records of the governing body of a municipality, appointing commissioners and alternate commissioners and reciting their appointments, shall constitute conclusive evidence of their appointment. The offices of commissioner, alternate commissioner, or officer of a joint agency are hereby declared to be offices which may be held by the holders of any office, place of trust or profit in addition to and concurrently with those offices permitted by G.S. 128-1.1 and other offices permitted by other General Statute.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-9ol1d">
       The board of commissioners of the joint agency shall annually elect one of the commissioners as chairman, another as vice-chairman, and another person or persons, who may but need not be commissioners, as treasurer, secretary, and, if desired, assistant secretary and assistant treasurer. The office of treasurer or assistant treasurer may be held by the secretary or assistant secretary. The board of commissioners may also appoint such additional officers as it deems necessary. The secretary or any assistant secretary of the joint agency shall keep a record of the proceedings of the joint agency, and the secretary shall be the custodian of all records, books, documents and papers filed with the joint agency, the minute book or journal of the joint agency and its official seal. Either the secretary or the assistant secretary of the joint agency may cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the joint agency and may give certificates under the official seal of the joint agency to the effect that such copies are true copies, and all persons dealing with the joint agency may rely upon such certificates.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-9ol1e">
       A majority of the commissioners of a joint agency then in office shall constitute a quorum. A vacancy in the board of commissioners of the joint agency shall not impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the joint agency. Any action taken by the joint agency under the provisions of this Chapter may be authorized by resolution at any regular or special meeting, and each such resolution may take effect immediately and need not be published or posted. A majority of the votes which the commissioners present are entitled to cast shall be necessary and sufficient to take any action or to pass any resolution, provided that such commissioners present are entitled to cast a majority of the votes of all commissioners of the board.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-9ol1f">
       No commissioner of a joint agency shall receive any compensation for the performance of his duties hereunder, provided, however, that each commissioner may be paid his necessary expenses incurred while engaged in the performance of such duties.

     <p>
      In determining whether or not creation of a joint agency for such purpose is in the best interests of the municipalities, the governing boards shall take into consideration, but shall not be limited to, the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      If each governing board shall determine that it is in the best interest of the municipality to create a joint agency to provide power and energy to the municipality as provided in this Chapter, each shall adopt a resolution or ordinance so finding (which need not prescribe in detail the basis for the determination), and which shall set forth the names of the municipalities which are proposed to be initial members of the joint agency. The governing board of the municipality shall thereupon by ordinance or resolution appoint one commissioner of the joint agency who may, at the discretion of the governing board, be an officer or employee of the municipality.

      Any two or more commissioners so named may file with the Secretary of State an application signed by them setting forth (i) the names of all the proposed member municipalities; (ii) the name and official residence of each of the commissioners so far as known to them; (iii) a certified copy of the appointment evidencing their right to office; (iv) a statement that each governing board of each respective municipality appointing a commissioner has made the aforesaid determination; (v) the desire that a joint agency be organized as a public body and a body corporate and politic under this Chapter; and (vi) the name which is proposed for the joint agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      The application shall be subscribed and sworn to by such commissioners before an officer or officers authorized by the laws of the State to administer and certify oaths.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State shall examine the application and, if he finds that the name proposed for the joint agency is not identical with that of any other corporation of this State or of any agency or instrumentality thereof, or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion and uncertainty, he shall receive and file it and shall record it in an appropriate book of record in his office.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the application has been made, filed and recorded as herein provided, the joint agency shall constitute a public body and a body corporate and politic under the name proposed in the application. The Secretary of State shall make and issue to the commissioners executing the application a certificate of incorporation pursuant to this Chapter under the seal of the State, and shall record the same with the application. The certificate shall set forth the names of the member municipalities.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of, or relating to, any contract of the joint agency, the joint agency, in the absence of establishing fraud in the premises, shall be conclusively deemed to have been established in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter upon proof of the issuance of the aforesaid certificate by the Secretary of State. A copy of such certificate, duly certified by the Secretary of State, shall be admissible in evidence in any such suit, action or proceeding, and shall be conclusive proof of the filing and contents thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of the issuance of such certificate shall be given to all of the proposed member municipalities by the Secretary of State. If a commissioner of any such municipality has not signed the application to the Secretary of State and such municipality does not notify the Secretary of State of the appointment of a commissioner within 40 days after receipt of such notice, such municipality shall be deemed to have elected not to be a member of the joint agency. As soon as practicable after the expiration of such 40-day period, the Secretary of State shall issue a new certificate of incorporation, if necessary, setting forth the names of those municipalities which have elected to become members of the joint agency. The failure of any proposed member to become a member shall not affect the validity of the corporate existence of the joint agency.

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-10ol1a">
       The board of commissioners of a joint agency may create an executive committee by resolution. The board may provide for the composition and terms of office of, and the method of filling vacancies on, the executive committee. The executive committee may include representatives of the joint agency, representatives of any other joint agency, and any other persons. The executive committee of a joint agency may simultaneously act as the executive committee of any other joint agency or agencies, or joint municipal assistance agency or agencies, if so provided by all such entities, and also may simultaneously act as the sole governing board of any joint municipal assistance agency created by two or more joint agencies pursuant to G.S. 159B-45 if so provided by all such joint agencies. An executive committee acting as the sole governing board of a joint municipal assistance agency shall not be subject to the limitations on the powers and authority of executive committees set forth in subsection (b) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-10ol1b">
       Except as limited by resolution of the board of commissioners creating an executive committee and except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an executive committee shall have and shall exercise all of the powers and authority of the board of commissioners creating the executive committee. However, the executive committee shall not have the power or authority to (i) amend any resolution of the board of commissioners of the joint agency relating to the creation of the executive committee or providing for its powers or authority; or (ii) adopt or amend a budget. Any rate for a joint agency adopted by an executive committee may be rejected, within 30 days following the adoption of the rate, by a vote of two-thirds in number of the commissioners representing the joint agency members affected by the rate. In the event that any rate is rejected in this manner, the executive committee shall, within 10 days following the action on the part of the commissioners, adopt a second rate for that joint agency, which may be the same rate as previously adopted. This second rate may be rejected, within 10 days following the adoption of the rate, by a vote of two-thirds in number of the commissioners representing the joint agency members affected by the rate. If a second rate adopted by the executive committee is rejected in this manner, the board of commissioners of the affected joint agency shall, acting by weighted vote, adopt a rate for the joint agency which is sufficient at least to comply with the requirements of G.S. 159B-17(b). No such rate adopted by the executive committee shall become effective so long as it is subject to rejection by commissioners of a joint agency as provided for in this subsection. However, if the executive committee determines that the establishment of a rate is required within 50 days to enable a joint agency to satisfy the requirements of G.S. 159B-17(b), the rate adopted by the executive committee shall be effective until changed by the executive committee or board of commissioners in accordance with this subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-10ol1c">
       Each member of the executive committee shall have one vote and shall serve at the pleasure of the governing board by which the member was appointed. Before performing duties as a member, each member shall take and subscribe to an oath before some person authorized by law to administer oaths to execute the duties of the office faithfully and impartially, and a record of each oath shall be filed with the governing board appointing the member and spread upon its minutes. The office of a member of an executive committee may be held by the holders of any office, place of trust or profit in addition to and concurrently with those offices permitted by G.S. 128-1.1 and other offices permitted by law.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-10ol1d">
       The executive committee shall annually elect from its membership a chair and vice-chair, and shall elect another person or persons, who need not be members, to serve as secretary and, if desired, assistant secretary. The secretary or any assistant secretary of the executive committee shall keep a record of the proceedings of the executive committee, and the secretary shall be the custodian of all records, books, documents, and papers filed with the executive committee, as well as the minute book or journal of the executive committee. Either the secretary or the assistant secretary of the executive committee may cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the executive committee and may give certificates of the executive committee to the effect that the copies are true copies, and all persons dealing with the executive committee may rely upon those certificates.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-10ol1e">
       A majority of the members of an executive committee then serving shall constitute a quorum. A vacancy on the executive committee shall not impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the executive committee. Any action taken by the executive committee under the provisions of this Chapter may be authorized by resolution at any regular or special meeting, and each such resolution may take effect immediately and need not be published or posted. A vote of the majority of the members present shall be necessary and sufficient to take any action or to pass any resolution, provided that those members present are entitled to cast a majority of the votes of all members of the executive committee.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-10ol1f">
       Members of the executive committee, and of any subcommittee created by the executive committee, may receive compensation and be paid expenses for the performance of their duties as determined by the board or boards of commissioners creating that executive committee. However, for any member of an executive committee who is an employee of a municipality, a payment in lieu of any compensation shall be made to the municipality for distribution to the executive committee member in the manner and amount, if any, it deems appropriate. An executive committee for more than one entity may be referred to as a board of directors of any or each of those entities.

       Any municipality which is a member of the joint agency may contract to buy from the joint agency power and energy for its present or future requirements, including the capacity and output of one or more specified projects. As the creation of a joint agency is an alternative method whereby a municipality may obtain the benefits and assume the responsibilities of ownership in a project, any such contract may provide that the municipality so contracting shall be obligated to make the payments required by the contract whether or not a project is completed, operable or operating and notwithstanding the suspension, interruption, interference, reduction or curtailment of the output of a project or the power and energy contracted for, and that such payments under the contract shall not be subject to any reduction, whether by offset or otherwise, and shall not be conditioned upon the performance or nonperformance of the joint agency or any other member of the joint agency under the contract or any other instrument. Any contract with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity or output of a project entered into between a joint agency and its member municipalities may also provide that if one or more of such municipalities shall default in the payment of its or their obligations with respect to the purchase of said capacity or output, then in that event the remaining member municipalities which are purchasing capacity and output under the contract shall be required to accept and pay for and shall be entitled proportionately to and may use or otherwise dispose of the capacity or output which was to be purchased by the defaulting municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, any such contract with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity, output, power, or energy from a project may extend for a period not exceeding 50 years from the date a project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous operation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, including, but not limited to, the provisions of G.S. 159B-44(13), any contract between a joint agency and a municipality or a joint municipal assistance agency (or between a municipality and a joint municipal assistance agency) to implement the provisions of G.S. 159B-11(19b) may extend for a period not exceeding 30 years; provided, that any such contract in respect of a capital project to be used by or for the benefit of a municipality shall be subject to the prior approval of the Local Government Commission of North Carolina. In reviewing any such contract for approval, said Local Government Commission shall consider the municipality's debt management procedures and policies, whether the municipality is in default with respect to its debt service obligations and such other matters as said Local Government Commission may believe to have a bearing on whether the contract should be approved.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-12ol1d">
       Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, the execution and effectiveness of any contracts authorized by this section shall not be subject to any authorizations or approvals by the State or any agency, commission or instrumentality or political subdivision thereof except as in this Chapter specifically required and provided.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      As a support contract authorized by this subsection is a replacement for and in lieu of the payment obligations authorized by subsection (a) of this section related to an existing project or projects, any support contract may provide that the contracting municipality is obligated to make the payments required by the support contract unconditionally and without offset, counterclaim, or otherwise, and notwithstanding the performance or nonperformance of the joint agency under the support contract, or of any other municipality entering into a similar support contract with the joint agency, or the delivery of or failure to deliver power or energy or the performance or nonperformance by any party under any related power supply contract. Any support contract entered into between a joint agency and its member municipalities may also provide that if any municipality defaults in the payment of its obligations under the support contract, the remaining member municipalities subject to the contract are required to pay a proportionate share of the defaulted payments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, the obligations of the municipality under a support contract may extend for a period of 30 years, except for accrued obligations as of the expiration of the period for which the contract may be continued until the accrued obligations are fully satisfied, and, with respect to administrative costs only, for a reasonable period of time thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Obligations under a support contract shall not be taken into account in computing any debt or other limitation that may be imposed by law. Being on account of the refinancing of obligations incurred in connection with the acquisition of a project or projects, the obligations of the municipality under any support contract shall constitute an operating expense of its municipal electric system for all purposes of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159.html#t159sIVa04s159-47" target="_blank">G.S. 159-47</a></cite> and other purposes, save only as may have been duly contracted with bondholders of the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payments by a municipality under any contract authorized by this section shall be made solely from the revenues derived from the ownership and operation of the electric system of said municipality and any obligation under such contract shall not constitute a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien, or encumbrance upon any property of the municipality or upon any of its income, receipts, or revenues, except the revenues of its electric system, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the municipality are, or may be, pledged for the payment of any obligation under any such contract. A municipality or joint agency, pursuant to an agreement with a municipality, shall be obligated to fix, charge and collect rents, rates, fees and charges for electric power and energy and other services, activities permitted in this Chapter, facilities and commodities sold, furnished or supplied through the electric system of the municipality sufficient to provide revenues adequate to meet its obligations under any such contract and to pay any and all other amounts payable from or constituting a charge and lien upon such revenues, including amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on general obligation bonds heretofore or hereafter issued by the municipality for purposes related to its electric system and payments pursuant to support contracts authorized by subsection (b) of this section. The willful or negligent failure by any municipality to comply with the obligations applicable to it shall constitute a failure or refusal to comply with the provisions of this Chapter for purposes of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159.html#t159sIVa11s159-181ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 159-181(c)</a></cite>, and the financial powers of the governing board of the municipality that may be vested in the Local Government Commission pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159.html#t159sIVa11s159-181ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 159-181(c)</a></cite> shall include those powers incident to carrying out the requirements and obligations specified in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payments by any joint municipal assistance agency to any joint agency under any contract or contracts authorized by this section, shall be made solely from the sources specified in such contract or contracts and no other, and any obligation under such contract shall not constitute a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien, or encumbrance upon any property of the joint municipal assistance agency or upon any of its income, receipts, or revenues, or upon any property of any municipality with which the joint agency or joint municipal assistance agency contracts or upon any of such municipality's income, receipts, or revenues in each case except such sources so specified. A joint municipal assistance agency shall be obligated to fix, charge and collect rents, rates, fees, and charges for providing aid and assistance sufficient to provide revenues adequate to meet its obligations under such contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any municipality which is a member of a joint agency may furnish the joint agency with money derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or facilities and provide the joint agency with personnel, equipment and property, both real and personal. Any municipality may also provide any services to a joint agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any member of a joint agency may contract for, advance or contribute funds derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or facilities to a joint agency as may be agreed upon by the joint agency and the member, and the joint agency shall repay such advances or contributions from proceeds of bonds, from operating revenues or from any other funds of the joint agency, together with interest thereon as may be agreed upon by the member and the joint agency.

Before he accepts the application, the secretary may require the governing board or its representatives to attend a preliminary conference at which time the secretary and his deputies may informally discuss the details of the proposed issue and the security therefor.
     </p>
     <p>
      After an application in proper form has been filed, and after a preliminary conference if one is required, the secretary shall notify the municipality or joint agency in writing that the application has been filed and accepted for submission to the Commission. The secretary's statement shall be conclusive evidence that the municipality or joint agency, as the case may be, has complied with the requirements of this section with respect to the filing of an application for approval by the said Local Government Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      In determining whether a proposed bond issue shall be approved, the Commission may consider:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-24ol11">
       The municipality's or joint agency's debt management procedures and policies.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-24ol12">
       Whether the municipality or joint agency is in default with respect to any of its debt service obligations.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-24ol13">
       Whether, based upon feasibility reports submitted to it, the probable revenues of the project to be financed or the revenues of the municipality's electric system, as the case may be, will be sufficient to service the proposed bonds.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba02s159B-24ol14">
       That the issuance of the proposed bonds will effectuate the purposes and policies of this Chapter.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The Commission may inquire into and give consideration to any other matters that it may believe to have a bearing on whether the issue should be approved except matters which are expressly required by the provisions of this Chapter to be determined by the North Carolina Utilities Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission shall approve the application if, upon the information and evidence it receives, it finds and determines:
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) That, based upon engineering studies and feasibility reports submitted to it, the principal amount of the proposed bonds will be adequate and not excessive for the proposed purpose of the issue.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) That the municipality's or joint agency's debt management procedures and policies are good, or that reasonable assurances have been given that its debt will henceforth be managed in strict compliance with law.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) That the requirements of this Chapter with respect to the issuance of the bonds and the details thereof and security therefor have been, or will be, satisfied.
     </p>
     <p>
      After considering an application, the Local Government Commission shall enter its order either approving or denying the application. An order approving an issue shall not be regarded as an approval of the legality of the bonds in any respect.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Commission enters an order denying the application, the proceedings under this section shall be at an end.
     </p>
     <p>
      At any time after the Commission approves an application for the issuance of bonds, the governing board of the issuer may adopt a bond resolution or enter into a trust agreement in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, and may thereafter at one time, or from time to time, issue the bonds as provided herein.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the filing with the Local Government Commission of a resolution of the issuer requesting that its bonds be sold, such bonds may be sold in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as the Local Government Commission shall determine to be for the best interest of the issuer and effectuate best the purposes of this Chapter, provided that such sale shall be approved by the issuer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as herein expressly provided, bonds may be issued and sold under the provisions of this Chapter without obtaining the approval or consent of any other department, division, commission, board, bureau or agency of the State, and without any other proceeding or the happening of any other condition or thing than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this Chapter.

      The purpose of this Article is to authorize joint agencies or municipalities to form one or more joint municipal assistance agencies which shall be empowered to provide aid and assistance to municipalities in the construction, ownership, maintenance, expansion and operation of their electric systems, to do such other acts and things as hereinafter provided and to carry out the powers and responsibilities hereinafter granted in this Chapter. It shall also be the purpose of a joint municipal assistance agency to provide aid and assistance to any joint agency in the exercise of its respective powers and functions. The term "provide aid and assistance" shall be liberally construed.

       Any two or more joint agencies, or any two or more municipalities, may organize a joint municipal assistance agency, which shall be a public body and body corporate and politic. Any joint agency or municipality is hereby authorized to become a member of any such joint municipal assistance agency upon a determination, by resolution or ordinance of its governing board, that economies, efficiencies and other benefits might be achieved from participation in such an agency.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba03s159B-43ol1b">
       After the creation of a joint municipal assistance agency, any other joint agency (if organized by joint agencies) or municipality (if organized by municipalities) may become a member thereof upon application to such joint municipal assistance agency after the adoption of a resolution or ordinance by the governing board of the joint agency or municipality setting forth the determination and finding prescribed above for the original members and authorizing said municipality to become a member and appointing one commissioner, and with the consent of a majority of the board of commissioners of the joint municipal assistance agency. Any joint agency or municipality may withdraw from a joint municipal assistance agency, provided, however, that all obligations incurred by a joint agency or municipality while it was a member shall remain in full force and effect. Notice that a joint agency or municipality has been added to or withdrawn from membership in the joint municipal assistance agency shall be filed with the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State shall thereupon issue a new or supplemental certificate of incorporation setting forth the names of all members of the joint municipal assistance agency. Additions of new members or withdrawal of members shall not affect the validity of the corporate existence of the joint municipal assistance agency.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba03s159B-43ol1c">
       The joint municipal assistance agency may be governed by a board of commissioners appointed as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. It shall not be necessary to notify the Secretary of State of the appointment of any commissioners following the notifications referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Each commissioner shall have one vote and shall serve at the pleasure of the governing board by which he was appointed. Each appointed commissioner before entering upon his duties shall take and subscribe to an oath before some person authorized by law to administer oaths to execute the duties of his office faithfully and impartially, and a record of each such oath shall be filed with the governing board of the appointing joint agency or municipality and spread upon its minutes. The governing board of each of the joint agencies or municipalities may appoint up to two alternate commissioners to act in lieu of its appointed commissioner when the appointed commissioner is unable for any reason to attend meetings of the board of commissioners or any committee thereof, and the governing board shall designate them as first or second alternate commissioner. Each alternate commissioner shall serve at the pleasure of the governing board by which he is appointed and shall take, subscribe to and file an oath in the same manner as prescribed for regularly appointed commissioners. Such alternate commissioner when acting in lieu of the regularly appointed commissioner shall be deemed to be the commissioner representing such joint agency or municipality, and shall have the rights, powers and authority of the regularly appointed commissioner, other than such commissioner's position as an officer, director or member of the executive committee. A certificate entered into the minutes of the board of commissioners of a joint agency by the clerk or other custodian of the minutes and records of the governing body of a municipality, appointing commissioners and alternate commissioners and reciting their appointments, shall constitute conclusive evidence of their appointment. All powers, functions, rights and privileges of the joint municipal assistance agency shall be exercised or delegated by the board of commissioners.

       The board of commissioners of the joint municipal assistance agency shall annually elect one of the commissioners as president, another as vice president, and another person or persons, who may but need not be commissioners, as treasurer, secretary, and, if desired, assistant secretary or secretaries and assistant treasurer. The office of treasurer or assistant treasurer may be held by the secretary or any assistant secretary. The board of commissioners may also appoint and prescribe the duties of such additional officers as it deems necessary. The secretary or any assistant secretary of the joint municipal assistance agency shall keep a record of the proceedings of the joint municipal assistance agency, and the secretary shall be the custodian of all records, books, documents and papers filed with the joint municipal assistance agency, the minute book or journal of the joint municipal assistance agency and its official seal. Either the secretary or any assistant secretary of the joint municipal assistance agency may cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the joint municipal assistance agency and may give certificates under the official seal of the joint municipal assistance agency to the effect that such copies are true copies, and all persons dealing with the joint municipal assistance agency may rely upon such certificates.

       Fifty-one percent (51%) of the commissioners of a joint municipal assistance agency then in office shall constitute a quorum, and the commissioners may by written consent executed before or after any meeting waive notice and all other formalities incident to the calling or conduct of the same. Meetings of the commissioners may be held at any place within the State or any state contiguous to the State. A vacancy in the board of commissioners of the joint municipal assistance agency shall not impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the joint municipal assistance agency. Any action taken by the joint municipal assistance agency under the provisions of this Chapter may be authorized by resolution at any regular or special meeting, and each such resolution may take effect immediately and need not be published or posted. Except as specifically provided by the bylaws, a majority of the votes of the commissioners present shall be necessary and sufficient to take any action or to pass any resolution.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba03s159B-43ol1f">
       The board of commissioners of the joint municipal assistance agency may, in its bylaws, provide for a board of directors of the joint municipal assistance agency to be selected from the commissioners and alternate commissioners. The board of directors shall have and exercise such of the powers and authority of the board of commissioners during the intervals between the board of commissioners' meetings as shall be prescribed in the bylaws, rules, motions and resolutions of the board of commissioners. The terms of office of the members of the board of directors and the method of filling vacancies therein shall be fixed by the bylaws of the board of commissioners of the joint municipal assistance agency. The bylaws of the joint municipal assistance agency shall provide that the officers of the board of commissioners elected pursuant to subsection (d) of this section must also serve on the board of directors and hold the same offices thereon.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ba03s159B-43ol1g">
       The board of commissioners may also provide, in its bylaws or otherwise, that the board of directors shall create an executive committee of the board of directors composed of the officers of the board of directors, together with such other members of the board of directors as may be prescribed and that such executive committee shall have and shall exercise such of the powers and authority of the board of directors during the intervals between that board's meetings as shall be prescribed in the bylaws of the joint municipal assistance agency or in the rules or resolutions of the board of directors.

       No commissioner or director of a joint municipal assistance agency shall receive any compensation for the performance of his or her duties hereunder, provided, however, that each commissioner and director may be paid his or her necessary expenses incurred while engaged in the performance of such duties.

      The resolution or ordinance determining it desirable for a joint agency or municipality to become a member of a joint municipal assistance agency (which need not prescribe in detail the basis for the determination) shall set forth the names of the joint agencies or municipalities which are proposed to be initial members of the joint municipal assistance agency. The governing board of the joint agency or municipality shall thereupon by ordinance or resolution appoint one commissioner and up to two alternate commissioners of the joint municipal assistance agency who may, at the discretion of the governing board, be an officer or employee of the joint agency or municipality. If two alternate commissioners are appointed, the governing board shall designate them as first or second alternate commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any two or more commissioners so named may file with the Secretary of State an application signed by them setting forth (i) the names of all the proposed member joint agencies or municipalities; (ii) the name and official residence of each of the commissioners so far as known to them; (iii) a certified copy of the appointment evidencing their right to office; (iv) a statement that each governing board of each respective joint agency or municipality appointing a commissioner has made the aforesaid determination; (v) the desire that a joint municipal assistance agency be organized as a public body and a body corporate and politic under this Chapter; and (vi) the name which is proposed for the joint municipal assistance agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      The application shall be subscribed and sworn to by such commissioners before an officer or officers authorized by the laws of the State to administer and certify oaths.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State shall examine the application and, if he finds that the name proposed for the joint municipal assistance agency is not identical with that of any other corporation of this State or of any agency or instrumentality thereof, or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion and uncertainty, he shall receive and file it and shall record it in an appropriate book of record in his office.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the application has been made, filed and recorded as herein provided, the joint municipal assistance agency shall constitute a public body and a body corporate and politic under the name proposed in the application. The Secretary of State shall make and issue to the commissioners executing the application a certificate of incorporation pursuant to this Chapter under the seal of the State, and shall record the same with the application. The certificate shall set forth the names of the member municipalities.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of, or relating to, any contract of the joint municipal assistance agency, the joint municipal assistance agency, in the absence of establishing fraud in the premises, shall be conclusively deemed to have been established in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter upon proof of the issuance of the aforesaid certificate by the Secretary of State. A copy of such certificate or of any new or supplemental certificate hereinafter provided for, duly certified by the Secretary of State, shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding, and shall be conclusive proof of the filing and contents thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of the issuance of such certificate shall be given to all of the proposed member joint agencies or municipalities by the Secretary of State. If a commissioner of any such joint agency or municipality has not signed the application to the Secretary of State and such joint agency or municipality does not notify the Secretary of State of the appointment of a commissioner within 60 days after receipt of such notice, such joint agency or municipality shall be deemed to have elected not to be a member of the joint municipal assistance agency. As soon as practicable after the expiration of such 60-day period, the Secretary of State shall issue a new certificate of incorporation, if necessary, setting forth the names of those joint agencies or municipalities which have elected to become members of the joint municipal assistance agency. The failure of any proposed member to become a member shall not affect the validity of the corporate existence of the joint municipal assistance agency.
