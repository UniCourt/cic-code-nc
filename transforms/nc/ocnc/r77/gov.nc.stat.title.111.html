       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 1973, c. 476, s. 143(a), provides that whenever the words "North Carolina State Commission for the Blind" are used or appear in any statute or law of this State, the same shall be deleted and the words "Department of Human Resources" or "Department," as appropriate, shall be inserted in lieu thereof, unless otherwise provided for in the Executive Organization Act of 1973, with the exception that in certain specified references the words "North Carolina State Commission for the Blind" shall be deleted and the words "Commission for the Blind" shall be inserted in lieu thereof. In this Chapter as it stood before the 1973 amendments, the North Carolina State Commission for the Blind was variously referred to as the "North Carolina State Commission for the Blind," the "State Commission for the Blind," or simply as the "Commission." In order to carry out the evident intent of the 1973 act, the codifiers have, in the sections set out herein, substituted references to the Department of Human Resources or the Commission for the Blind, as appropriate, for references to the former North Carolina State Commission for the Blind, even where that agency was not referred to by its full title.

     <p>
      The Department of Health and Human Services may establish one or more training schools and workshops for employment of suitable blind and visually impaired persons, equip and maintain these schools and workshops, pay employees suitable wages, devise means for the sale and distribution of the products of these schools and workshops, and cooperate with shops already established. The Department of Health and Human Services may also pay for lodging, tuition, support and all necessary expenses for blind and visually impaired persons during their training or instruction in any suitable occupation, whether it be in industrial, commercial, professional, or any other establishments, schools or institutions, or through private instruction when in the judgment of the Department of Health and Human Services this instruction or training can be obtained and will contribute to the efficiency or self-support of the blind and visually impaired persons. When special educational opportunities cannot be had within the State, they may be arranged for, at the discretion of the Department of Health and Human Services, outside of the State. The Department of Health and Human Services may also aid individual blind and visually impaired persons or groups of blind and visually impaired persons to become self-supporting by furnishing material or equipment to them and by assisting them in the sale and distribution of their products. Any portion of the funds appropriated to the Department of Health and Human Services under the provisions of this Chapter providing for the rehabilitation of the blind and visually impaired and the prevention of blindness may, when the Commission for the Blind deems wise, be given in direct money payments to the needy blind in accordance with the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t111a02s111-13" target="_self">G.S. 111-13</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="#t111a02s111-26" target="_self">G.S. 111-26</a></cite>.

     </p>
     <p>
      At the time of fixing the annual budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1937, and annually thereafter, the board of county commissioners in each county shall, based upon such information as they are able to secure and with such information as may be furnished to them by the Department of Health and Human Services, estimate the number of needy blind persons in such county who shall be entitled to aid under the provisions of this Article and the total amount of such county's part thereof required to be paid by such county. Each county shall make appropriations for the purposes of this Article in an amount sufficient to cover its share of aid to the blind and may fund them by levy of property taxes pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html#t153Aa07s153A-149" target="_blank">G.S. 153A-149</a></cite> and by the allocation of other revenues whose use is not otherwise restricted by law. This provision is mandatory on each county in the State. Any court of competent jurisdiction is authorized by mandamus to enforce the foregoing provisions. No funds shall be allocated to any county by the Department of Health and Human Services until the provisions hereof have been fully complied with by such county.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case such appropriation is exhausted within the year and is found to be insufficient to meet the county's part of the amount required for aid to the needy blind, such deficiency may be borrowed, if within constitutional limitations, at the lowest rate of interest obtainable, not exceeding six percent (6%), and provision for payment thereof shall be made in the next annual budget and tax levy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of county commissioners in the several counties of the State shall cause to be transmitted to the State Treasurer their share of the total amount of relief granted to the blind applicants. Such remittances shall be made by the several counties in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, beginning July 1, 1937. The State Treasurer shall deposit said funds and credit same to the account of the Department of Health and Human Services to be employed in carrying out the provisions of this Article.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within the limitations of the State appropriation, the maximum payment for aid to the blind is to be such as will make possible maximum matching funds by the federal government.

     <p>
      After an award to a blind person has been made by the board of county commissioners, and approved by the Department of Health and Human Services the Department of Health and Human Services shall thereafter pay to such person to whom such award is made the amount of said award in monthly payments, or in such manner and under such terms as the Department of Health and Human Services shall determine.

Such amount shall be expended and disbursed solely for the use of the needy blind coming within the eligibility provisions outlined in Chapter 124 of the Public Laws of 1937.

     <p>
      If any otherwise qualified applicant for or recipient of aid to the blind is or shall become unable to manage the assistance payments, or otherwise fails so to manage, to the extent that deprivation or hazard to himself or others results, a petition may be filed by a relative of said blind person, or other interested person, or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services before the appropriate court under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t111a02s111-31" target="_self">G.S. 111-31</a></cite>, in the form of a verified written application for the appointment of a personal representative for the purpose of receiving and managing public assistance payments for any such recipient, which application shall allege one or more of the above grounds for the legal appointment of such personal representative.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court shall summarily order a hearing on the petition and shall cause the applicant or recipient to be notified at least five days in advance of the time and place for the hearing. Findings of fact shall be made by the court without a jury, and if the court shall find that the applicant for or recipient of aid to the blind is unable to manage the assistance payments, or otherwise fails so to manage, to the extent that deprivation or hazard to himself or others results, the court may thereupon enter an order embracing said findings and appointing some responsible person as personal representative of the applicant or recipient for the purposes set forth herein. The personal representative so appointed shall serve with or without bond, in the discretion of the court, and without compensation. He will be responsible for receiving the monthly assistance payment and using the proceeds of such payment for the benefit of the recipient of aid to the blind. Such personal representative shall be responsible to the court for the faithful discharge of the duties of his trust. The court may consider the recommendation of the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the selection of a suitable person for appointment as personal representative for the limited purposes of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t111a02s111-30" target="_self">G.S. 111-30</a></cite> to 111-33. The personal representative so appointed may be removed by the court, and the proceeding dismissed, or another suitable personal representative appointed. All costs of court with respect to any such proceedings shall be waived.
     </p>
     <p>
      From the order of the court appointing or removing such personal representative, an appeal may be had to the judge of superior court who shall hear the matter de novo without a jury.
