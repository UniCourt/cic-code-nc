                <p>
                    Editor's Note. - Session Laws 1959, c. 879, s. 1 inserted this present Chapter numbered 29 and entitled "Intestate Succession" to replace former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html" target="_blank">Chapter 29</a></cite>                    entitled "Descents." By the same act G.S. 28-149, with regard to order of distribution, was repealed and other related statutory provisions were repealed or amended to conform with the new Intestate Succession Law. Section 15 of the
                    1959 act provides: "This act shall become effective July 1, 1960, and shall be applicable only to estates of persons dying on or after July 1, 1960."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the cases cited in the notes to the sections of this Chapter construe similar provisions of the former Chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 4.1 of Session Laws 1963, c. 1209, provides that from and after the certification of the constitutional amendment to G.S. 6 of Art. X (see now N.C. Const. Art. X, G.S. 4) which was proposed by c. 1209, wherever the word "spouse" appears in the
                    General Statutes with reference to testate or intestate successions, it shall apply alike to both husband and wife. The approval of the amendment by vote of the people was certified by the Governor on February 6, 1964.

                        Purpose of Chapter. - Taken as a whole, this Chapter conveys an intent by the legislature to write a reasonable will for those residents who have not done so. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d
                        819 (1977).

                        Descents are regulated by statute in this State. Edwards v. Yearby, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 663</cite>, 85 S.E. 19 (1915); University of N.C. v. Markham, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 338</cite>, 93 S.E. 845 (1917).

                    <p>
                        English Canons of Descent Formerly Followed. - The English canons of descent remained in force in North Carolina until 1784. Because certain provisions seemed repugnant to republican principles, the legislature was led to make the changes which distinguish
                        this section from the English act. Clement v. Cauble, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 82</cite> (1854).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Legislative Intent as to Effect of Adoption. - The General Assembly, on its own motion and also in response to judicial decisions, has, with every amendment and every rewrite of G.S. 48-23, evidenced its intent that by adoption the child adopted becomes
                        legally a child of its new parents, and the adoption makes him legally a stranger to the bloodline of his natural parents. Crumpton v. Crumpton, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 221 S.E.2d
                        390 (1976), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 97, 281 S.E.2d 1 (1981).

                        Wrongful Death Beneficiaries Determined as of Time of Death. - The persons who, under the Intestate Succession Act, are entitled to the recovery in a wrongful death action are to be determined as of the time of the decedent's death. First Union Nat'l
                        Bank v. Hackney, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 17</cite>, 145 S.E.2d 352 (1965).

                            Computation of Net Estate. - To ascertain "net estate" under subdivision (5) it is necessary to subtract from the value of the gross estate, "family allowances, costs of administration, and all lawful claims against the estate." Phillips v. Phillips,
                            <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).

                            Federal Estate Tax Is "Lawful Claim." - The federal estate tax is one of the "lawful claims" against testator's estate, and the widow's intestate share of the estate is to be computed after its deduction. Phillips v. Phillips,
                            <cite

                            Legacies Not Excluded in Determining Net Estate. - The phrase "all lawful claims against the estate," as used in subdivision (5), does not include either specific legacies or general legacies for specific amounts. If it did, the net estate in many instances
                            would be so deleted by their payment that it would be insufficient to provide the widow with the same share of her husband's real and personal property as if he died intestate. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Melvin,

                            As Legacies or Distributive Shares Are Not "Lawful Claims." - In the use of the phrase "lawful claims against the estate" in subdivision (5), the legislature was not referring to claims of beneficiaries created either by the will or the statute of descents
                            and distributions. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Melvin, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 255</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 387 (1963).

                            Property Owned as Tenants by the Entirety. - The value of real property owned by couple as tenants by the entirety should not be included in testatrix's net estate for purposes of the dissent statute. In re Estate of Francis,

                            net estate for distribution to other devisees and legatees was as defined in this section. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Melvin, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 255</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 387 (1963).

                            shares which they are entitled to take, unless the language of the will reveals a contrary intent. Rawls v. Rideout, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 328 S.E.2d 783 (1985).

                        Rights of collateral succession are limited to the descendants of the intestate's parents or grandparents. This section limits such succession to those persons who are within five degrees of kinship to the intestate, and the effect of the proviso engrafted
                        upon this section is to provide for unlimited succession by collateral kinsmen descended from the intestate's parents or grandparents in the event there are no collateral kinsmen of the fifth degree in such lines of descent. Newlin

                        proviso restates the existing effect of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a02s29-15" target="_self">G.S. 29-15</a></cite>, i.e., that collateral descent shall be unlimited when it is within the parentela of an intestate's parents
                        or grandparents. Thus, in enacting this section, the legislature did not intend to eliminate escheats. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).

                        Effect of Section as to Escheat under G.S. 29-12. - This section has no application to escheat under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-12" target="_self">G.S. 29-12</a></cite> unless the common ancestor of the collateral kin
                        and the decedent is a parent or grandparent of the decedent. In such an event the main clause in this section operates to exclude a collateral kinsman of a sixth or higher degree from succeeding to the estate, even though he is
                        a lineal descendent of the decedent's parents or grandparents. The proviso in this section, in order to prevent the escheat of the decedent's estate, provides for unlimited succession by collateral kinsmen who are descendants of
                        the decedent's parents or grandparents when there is no such collateral kinsman within the fifth degree. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 392, 232 S.E.2d 213, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>,

                        This section creates a mandatory plan for disposing of a decedent's property which does not pass by will. It directs that the property pass by intestate succession without regard to the intent expressed by a testator in a will. Ferguson v. Croom,

                        Presumption against partial intestacy is merely a rule of construction and cannot have the effect of transferring property in the face of contrary provisions in the will. The presumption must yield when outweighed by manifest and unequivocal intent. McKinney

                        Illustrative Case. - Where, as gleaned from will itself, the intent of the testator was that the residue of his estate was to pass to named beneficiaries under the residuary clause of the will only if testator's wife survived him, and she did not, the
                        residue would pass to his heirs at law in accordance with the laws of intestacy as enacted by the legislature. McKinney v. Mosteller, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 730</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 612 (1988).

                        Effect of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-7" target="_self">G.S. 29-7</a></cite> as to Escheat under This Section. - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-7" target="_self">G.S. 29-7</a></cite> has no application to escheat
                        under this section unless the common ancestor of the collateral kin and the decedent is a parent or grandparent of the decedent. In such an event the main clause in G.S. 29-7 operates to exclude a collateral kinsman of a sixth
                        or higher degree from succeeding to the estate, even though he is a lineal descendent of the decedent's parents or grandparents. The proviso in G.S. 29-7 in order to prevent the escheat of the decedent's estate provides for unlimited
                        succession by collateral kinsmen who are descendants of the decedent's parents or grandparents when there is no such collateral kinsman within the fifth degree. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 392, 232

                        and by its proviso restates the existing effect of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a02s29-15" target="_self">G.S. 29-15</a></cite>, i.e., that collateral descent shall be unlimited when it is within the parentela of an intestate's

                        Unrefunded ticket proceeds is neither abandoned nor derelict property. By purchasing a ticket to a concert, the ticket holder enters into a contract with the auditorium and the performer. If the contract is not performed, he or she may rescind the agreement
                        and demand a refund, but is not compelled to do so. Nor must the auditorium operator or performer refund the purchase price absent a demand. If that were the case, the ticket holder would be unjustly enriched in retaining both
                        money and memento. The auditorium is not a trustee of the unrefunded proceeds of the ticket sale; the auditorium is simply a party to an unperformed contract. North Carolina State Treas. v. City of Asheville,

                        The power of the legislature to determine who shall take the property of a person dying subsequent to the effective date of a legislative act cannot be doubted. Johnson v. Blackwelder, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 209</cite>,
                        148 S.E.2d 30 (1966).

                    <p>
                        Law at Time of Death Governs. - It is well settled that an estate must be distributed among heirs and distributees according to the law as it exists at the time of the death of the ancestor. Johnson v. Blackwelder, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 209</cite>,
                        148 S.E.2d 30 (1966).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even Though Decedent Became Incompetent to Make Will Before Law Changed. - Where it was alleged that an intestate became mentally incapable of making a will prior to ratification of the Intestate Succession Act on June 10, 1959, and that such mental incapacity
                        continued until his death, and it was contended that the intestate's personal estate should be distributed in accordance with the Intestate Succession Law as it existed on June 9, 1959, it was held that this contention assumes:
                        Before he became mentally incapable of making a will, the intestate had knowledge of and was pleased with the statutes of descent and distribution; if he had made a will, he would have disposed of his estate as provided by the
                        statutes then in effect; he would have been displeased with the provisions of the 1959 act; and, but for his mental incapacity, would have made a will disposing of his estate as provided by the statutes in effect prior to ratification
                        of the 1959 act. Such successive assumptions underlying the contention are unwarranted. They relate to matters that lie wholly within the realm of speculation. The intestate had no vested right in the statutes of descent and distribution
                        in effect prior to the ratification of the 1959 act. He was charged with knowledge that these statutes were subject to change by the General Assembly. Johnson v. Blackwelder, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 209</cite>,
                        148 S.E.2d 30 (1966).

                    <p>
                        Determinative fact is that the intestate made no will. Hence, his estate "shall descend and be distributed" in accordance with the statutes in effect on the date of his death, namely, this Chapter. Johnson v. Blackwelder,

                        Intent to Release Share Implicit in Separation Agreement. - Where the intention of each party to the marriage to release his or her share in the estate of the other is implicit in the express provisions of their separation agreement, their situation and
                        purpose at the time the instrument was executed, the law will imply release of rights under this section and specifically enforce the agreement. Lane v. Scarborough, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 407</cite>,

                        Provisions in a separation agreement that each would thereafter acquire, hold, and dispose of property as though unmarried and that each renounced the right to administer upon the estate of the other refuted the contention that one spouse intended to
                        retain any rights in the other's estate. Lane v. Scarborough, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 407</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 622 (1973).

                        Wife May Be Administratrix Where Marital Relations Resumed. - Where, after the execution of a separation agreement and consent judgment between husband and wife, the wife returned to the marital home which she and her husband shared before the separation;
                        thereafter the commissioners named in the consent judgment to sell the couple's joint property for division were instructed not to do so; the husband paid the wife's attorney for representing her in the litigation between them;
                        and from the time the wife returned to the marital home until her husband's death, the husband and wife lived continuously in their marital residence, the wife was entitled to qualify as administratrix of the estate of her husband
                        and share in his estate as his widow without prejudice by reason of the separation agreement and consent judgment. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541 (1976).

                        This section defines the share of the surviving spouse of an intestate. Tolson v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 506</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 135 (1963); Peoples Oil Co. v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 696</cite>,

                        Words Describing Relationships Bear Ordinary Meanings. - In carefully naming the persons who take in cases of intestacy using words describing family relationships such as "parents," "brothers," "sisters," "grandparents," "aunts" and "uncles," the legislature
                        intended that these words bear their ordinary and usual meaning. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).

                    <p>
                        Words Cannot Be Expanded. - The words "brother," "parent" and "grandparent" cannot be expanded to include other relationships such as "great-grandfather" or "great uncle." Therefore, the maxim, "Expressio unius est exclusio alterius" (the expression of
                        one thing is the exclusion of another) tends to exclude collateral kin who are not in the parentela of the intestate's parents or grandparents. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>,
                        237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).

                        intended to apply when "share" is used "to describe the share of a net estate or property," e.g., a share under this section which thus "includes . . . the undivided fractional interest in the real property." Smith v. Smith,

                        The intestate share does not include the value of property passing by survivorship (which includes property owned as tenants by the entirety), joint accounts with right of survivorship, and insurance payable to the surviving spouse. In re Estate of Connor,

                        A deed by plaintiff's husband, which was executed while he and plaintiff were living together and which conveyed his separate real property to his children by a prior marriage, was effective to convey title to the children free from any claims of plaintiff.

                        Present Right of Possession Not Conferred. - A wife is not a real party in interest so as to interpose as a defense or counterclaim, in an action in ejectment instituted by her husband's grantee, that her husband had fraudulently conveyed the lands without
                        her joinder in order to deprive her of the possession thereof, since this section, defining the share of the surviving spouse of an intestate, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a08s29-30" target="_self">G.S. 29-30</a></cite>,

                        Surviving Wife and Child Each Take Undivided One Half of Lands. - Upon the death of an intestate, title to his lands immediately vests in his wife and child under this section, each taking a one-half undivided interest in fee. Smith v. Smith,

                        Share of Second or Successive Spouse. - Former G.S. 30-3(b), which provided that a second or successive spouse who dissented from the will of his deceased spouse should take only one half the amount provided by the Intestate Succession Act for the surviving
                        spouse if the testator had surviving him lineal descendants by a former marriage but there were not surviving lineal descendants by the second or successive marriage, was not arbitrarily discriminatory and capricious so as to be
                        violative of the due process provisions of the federal and State Constitutions. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).

                        Absence of Lineal Descendants. - There being no lineal descendants, under this section the surviving widow is entitled to "all the net estate" of an intestate. Johnson v. Blackwelder, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 209</cite>,
                        148 S.E.2d 30 (1966).

                        Where decedent was not survived by a child, children, or any lineal decedent of a deceased child or children, or by a parent, surviving spouse was proper recipient of remainder interest in four parcels of land that passed as partial intestacy. Tarlton

                        Wife's right to dissent from her husband's will depends on whether she is entitled to take a widow's share of his estate under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a02s29-13" target="_self">G.S. 29-13</a></cite> and this section. Sloop

                        Wife Waived Right to Dissent from Will. - Where by the terms of a deed of separation a wife released her right to take a widow's share of her husband's estate, she thereby waived her right to dissent from his will. Sloop v. Sloop,
                        <cite

                    <p>
                        Distribution of Estate When Surviving Spouse Dissents from Will. - When a surviving spouse dissents from a will, the intestate share should be allocated so as to cause the least possible disruption of the decedent's plan for the distribution of his estate.
                        In partitioning testatrix's property, her will should be given consideration, and insofar as possible the beneficiaries of the will should receive the property testatrix intended for them to receive. In re Estate of Etheridge,
                        <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 235 S.E.2d 924, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 253</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 535 (1977).

                    <p>
                        This section does not purport to give a dissenting spouse the right to select the particular property he or she will receive in opposition to the dominant intent expressed in a will. The dominant intent expressed in the will is still controlling so long
                        as it can be carried out and leave the dissenting spouse with the prescribed interest in value in the estate. In re Estate of Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 235 S.E.2d 924, cert.

                        Wrongful Death Action. - In a wrongful death action, the real parties in interest were the beneficiaries as defined in the Wrongful Death Act, who were the same persons who would have received property had the decedent died intestate; where the decedent
                        was not survived by a child, children, or any lineal descendant of a deceased child or children, or by a parent, the decedent's spouse received all of the wrongful death proceeds, and where the widow was not entitled to a wrongful
                        death recovery, the remaining beneficiaries did not succeed to a full 100 percent, but only received their original percentage, so there were no beneficiaries to the wrongful death claim. Locust v. Pitt County Mem'l Hosp.,

                        Wrongful Act Bars Husband from Share of Wrongful Death Recovery. - Where it is a husband's wrongful act which caused the death of his wife intestate, he may not share in a recovery from an action for wrongful death. Should the jury return a verdict in
                        favor of the administrator of her estate, the court will enter judgment for only two thirds of the amount of the verdict. Cummings v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 572, 183 S.E.2d 832,

                        award must be reduced by the statutory share of the wrongdoer. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Lack, 476 F.2d 583 (4th Cir. 1973).

                        consistently been deemed not to pass through the personal estate of the deceased, but rather to arise out of a right of action belonging peculiarly to the personal representative for the benefit of the intestate successors. St.

                        Remarriage Restores All Rights and Privileges. - When a married couple enters into a separation agreement, later divorces, and then remarries, each party to the marriage regains all rights and privileges incident to marriage unless there is evidence to
                        the contrary. Batten v. Batten, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 685, 482 S.E.2d 18 (1997).

                        Intent to Release Share Implicit in Separation Agreement. - Where the intention of each party to the marriage to release his or her share in the estate of the other is implicit in the express provisions of their separation agreement, their situation and
                        purpose at the time the instrument was executed, the law will imply release of rights under this section and specifically enforce the agreement. Lane v. Scarborough, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 407</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Provisions in a separation agreement that each would thereafter acquire, hold, and dispose of property as though unmarried and that each renounced the right to administer upon the estate of the other refuted the contention that one spouse intended to
                        retain any rights in the other's estate. Lane v. Scarborough, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 407</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 622 (1973).

                        Wife May Be Administratrix Where Marital Relations Resumed. - Where, after the execution of a separation agreement and consent judgment between husband and wife, the wife returned to the marital home which she and her husband shared before the separation;
                        thereafter the commissioners named in the consent judgment to sell the couple's joint property for division were instructed not to do so; the husband paid the wife's attorney for representing her in the litigation between them;
                        and from the time the wife returned to the marital home until her husband's death, the husband and wife lived continuously in their marital residence, the wife was entitled to qualify as administratrix of the estate of her husband
                        and share in his estate as his widow without prejudice by reason of the separation agreement and consent judgment. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541 (1976).

                        Words Describing Relationships Bear Ordinary Meanings. - In carefully naming the persons who take in cases of intestacy using words describing family relationships such as "parents," "brothers," "sisters," "grandparents," "aunts" and "uncles," the legislature
                        intended that these words bear their ordinary and usual meaning. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).

                    <p>
                        Words Cannot Be Expanded. - The words "brother," "parent" and "grandparent" cannot be expanded to include other relationships such as "great-grandfather" or "great uncle." Therefore, the maxim "Expressio unius est exclusio alterius" (the expression of
                        one thing is the exclusion of another) tends to exclude collateral kin who are not in the parentela of the intestate's parents or grandparents. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>,

                        When a gift is made to a class of "heirs," the intestacy laws govern not only the identification of the "heirs," but also the shares to which they are entitled. Rawls v. Rideout, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 328

                        Per Capita Distribution. - This chapter calls for a per capita distribution of the decedent's real and personal property to all surviving persons in the same degree of relationship to the decedent. The distribution scheme is commonly referred to as "per
                        capita at each generation." Rawls v. Rideout, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 328 S.E.2d 783 (1985).

                        Wrongful Death Action. - In a wrongful death action, the real parties in interest were the beneficiaries as defined in the Wrongful Death Act, who were the same persons who would have received property had the decedent died intestate; where a widow, who

                        Per Capita Distribution. - This chapter calls for a per capita distribution of the decedent's real and personal property to all surviving persons in the same degree of relationship to the decedent. The distribution scheme is commonly referred to as "per

                        Not Function of Administrator to Partition Real Estate. - It is the duty of the administrator to make distribution of the surplus of his intestate's personal property among those entitled thereto, but it is not his function to partition the real estate
                        of his decedent among the heirs. King v. Neese, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 132</cite>, 63 S.E.2d 123 (1951).

                        sister, as administratrix had standing to file the action. Locust v. Pitt County Mem'l Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 113</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 543 (2004).

                        Equitable adoption, does not confer the incidents of formal statutory adoption; rather, it merely confers rights of inheritance upon the foster child in the event of intestacy of the foster parents. Lankford v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 115</cite>,
                        489 S.E.2d 604 (1997).

                        Rights of Adopted Child Same as for Natural Child. - The legislature has provided that an adopted child from the date of its adoption shall have the same property rights as a natural born child from the date of its birth. Headen v. Jackson,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">255 N.C. 157</cite>, 120 S.E.2d 598 (1961).

                    <p>
                        Any provision of law which prevented an adopted child from sharing in property, by descent or distribution in the same manner and to the same extent as a natural born child, was swept away by the repealing clause in chapter 813, Session Laws of 1955.
                        Headen v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 157</cite>, 120 S.E.2d 598 (1961).

                        An adopted child shall be entitled to inherit property by, through, and from his adoptive parents as if he were born the legitimate child of the adoptive parents. Greenlee v. Quinn, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 601</cite>, 122

                        Right of an adopted child to inherit vests as of death of her adoptive parent, and therefore where the parent died prior to the effective date of an act creating a new rule of descent and of distribution the act is not applicable. Wilson v. Anderson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 521</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 447 (1950).

                        Inheritance from Brother of Adopting Parent. - Under the provisions of Session Laws 1955, c. 813, s. 6, an adopted child was entitled to inherit property from the brother of the adopting parent, notwithstanding that the decree of adoption was entered
                        prior to the passage of the statute, the legislature having the power to determine who shall take the property of a person dying subsequent to the effective date of a legislative act. Bennett v. Cain,

                    <p>
                        Section Has No Bearing upon Whether Adopted Child Takes under Will. - The statutes relating to the right of adopted children to take as distributees and heirs have no bearing upon whether an adopted child takes under a will, except insofar as they establish
                        and define the parent and child relationship between the adoptive parents and the adopted child. Bradford v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 572</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 632 (1953).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Biological Parent Need Not Join in Spouse's Petition for Adoption of Children. - Subsection (e) of this section and G.S. 48-7(d) were enacted, not to retain adopted children's status as "lineal descendants" by the former marriage, but instead to provide
                        that the parent-child relationship between adopted children and their biological parent is not severed by the parent's spouse's adoption of her children from a former marriage. Since the relationship remains intact in this limited
                        situation, it is not necessary for such a biological parent to become a co-petitioner in her husband's adoption of her legitimate children of a former marriage. This biological parent, however, must consent to the adoption, as
                        must any biological parent who does not come within the ambit of G.S. 48-6. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Wife's failure to "join" in her husband's petition for the adoption of her two minor children by a previous marriage in no way affected her relationship with the children and was immaterial to a determination of her husband's distributive share under
                        former G.S. 30-3(b). In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 40 (1986).

                        Different Treatment of Mother and Father Not Unconstitutional. - While this section classifies the illegitimate's mother and her heirs and the putative father and his heirs differently by placing the additional requirement on the father to establish his
                        paternity by one of the statutorily prescribed methods before he is permitted to inherit, this classification is substantially related to permissible State interests. This section does not violate the equal protection clause of
                        U.S. Const., Amend. XIV in this regard. Estate of Stern v. Stern, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 311 S.E.2d 909 (1984), appeal dismissed, 471 U.S. 1011, 105 S. Ct. 2010, 85 L. Ed. 2d 294

                        Interest of State in Inheritance Rights of Illegitimate Children. - By specifying the manner and time in which an illegitimate may establish his paternity, this State has sought (1) to mitigate the hardships created by former law (which permitted illegitimates
                        to inherit only from the mother and from each other); (2) to equalize insofar as practical the inheritance rights of legitimate and illegitimate children; and, (3) at the same time to safeguard the just and orderly disposition
                        of a decedent's property and the dependability of titles passing under intestate laws. Mitchell v. Freuler, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 206</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 762 (1979).

                        This section and the other statutes referred to herein (G.S. 49-14 through 49-16), insofar as they provide that an illegitimate child may inherit from its father only if paternity has been acknowledged in writing or finally adjudged in the lifetime of
                        the father and otherwise in accord with those applicable statutes, establish a statutory scheme which bears an evident and substantial relation to the permissible and important interest of the State in providing for the just and
                        orderly disposition of property at death. Outlaw v. Planters Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 571, 255 S.E.2d 189 (1979).

                        Interest of State in Inheritance by Father from Illegitimate Child. - The requirement imposed on the father of an illegitimate who would inherit from his illegitimate child is substantially related to the important State interests that this section is
                        intended to promote. Estate of Stern v. Stern, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 311 S.E.2d 909 (1984).

                        Birth certification amendment application form did not meet requirements of subsection (b) where it contained no statement by the putative father or anyone else that he was the father of the child, and even if his signature in the blank space involved
                        could be construed to be an unambiguous acknowledgment of paternity, he did not swear to it before any official authorized to administer oaths. In re Will of Bunch, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite>                        463, 358 S.E.2d 118 (1987).

                        Right to Inherit Established upon Adjudication of Paternity. - Once plaintiffs satisfied the notice requirement of this section, and showed that decedent had been adjudged their father under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.049.html#t49a01s49-1" target="_blank">G.S. 49-1</a></cite>                        through 49-9, their right to inherit was established as a matter of law; it did not depend upon a declaration in a court order or judgment.

                        A putative father and his kindred are only entitled to inherit from an illegitimate child if paternity has been established by one of the methods prescribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>.

                        Acknowledgment Not Filed. - Where petitioner acknowledged his paternity before a notary public and executed the "Affidavit Of Parentage For Child Born Out Of Wedlock" but never filed the acknowledgment with the clerk of court, he did not fulfill all the
                        requirements under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>. In re Estate of Morris, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 264, 472 S.E.2d 786 (1996).

                    <p>
                        Putative child was not the child's putative father's heir because strict compliance, not substantial compliance, with the procedures in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)(2)</a></cite>                        was required to establish an illegitimate child as a legal heir, and the statute was not strictly complied with when the father's affidavit of paternity was not filed with the clerk. In re Estate of Williams, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite>                        76, 783 S.E.2d 253 (2016).

                        Compliance with Section Essential. - Where there has been no compliance with this section, illegitimate child has no right to inherit from deceased putative father. Hayes v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 52,

                    <p>
                        Illegitimate child's complaint seeking a declaration that she was the sole heir of a decedent was properly dismissed where the complaint did not claim that the decedent was adjudged to be the child's father, or that the decedent had acknowledged himself
                        to be the child's father in a written instrument which was duly executed and filed; absent <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>, an illegitimate child had
                        no right to inherit from his or her putative father, and, although a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test had established that the decedent was the child's biological father, a positive DNA test was not listed in the statute as a method
                        of meeting the requirements to legitimate a child. Phillips v. Ledford, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 590 S.E.2d 280, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 377</cite>, 597 S.E.2d 133 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Clerk of court did not err in finding that claimants failed to show compliance with any of the four forms of legitimation necessary for illegitimate children to inherit from or through their putative fathers because they did not fulfill the statutory
                        requirements for establishing legitimation under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>; four legitimation methods available in North Carolina were a verified
                        petition filed with a court, the marriage of the mother and putative father, a civil action to establish paternity, or an action for criminal nonsupport. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 701 S.E.2d

                        Plea of Guilty in Bastardy Action as Basis for Inheritance by Child. - An illegitimate child may inherit, through intestate succession, from the estate of a father who acknowledged paternity to the child by pleading guilty in a criminal bastardy action.

                        Notice under Subsection (b) as Condition Precedent. - The requirement of subsection (b) that illegitimate children give written notice of their claims of inheritance to the personal representatives of their putative fathers' estates within six months
                        after the first publication or posting of general notice to creditors is a condition precedent to an illegitimate child's right to receive a distribution from the estate of a father who meets the description in subdivision (1)
                        or (2) of subsection (b). Estate of Lucas v. Jarrett, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 284 S.E.2d 711 (1981).

                        Form of Notice. - Subsection (b) does not specify any particular form the notice required of illegitimate children must take. Estate of Lucas v. Jarrett, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 284 S.E.2d 711 (1981).

                        Plaintiffs' verified complaint seeking revocation of defendant's letters, which fully alleged the basis of their claim of entitlement to inherit from decedent and was received by defendant, as personal representative of the estate, within the statutory
                        period for notice, satisfied the notice requirement of subsection (b) of this section. Estate of Lucas v. Jarrett, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 284 S.E.2d 711 (1981).

                        The formalities of subdivision (b)(2) of this section serve a dual purpose. - As a method for establishing paternity, a written instrument acknowledging paternity, executed and filed with the clerk of superior court, assures the requisite degree of certainty.
                        The formalities further assure that the decedent intended that the illegitimate child share in his estate, much in the same way that a father intentionally excludes legitimate children as beneficiaries under his will. Herndon v.

                        Documents Inadequate under Subdivision (b)(2). - Plaintiff's proof of numerous written documents, signed by his putative father, which clearly acknowledged paternity, did not rise to the dignity of constructive compliance with subdivision (b)(2) of this
                        section, where the documents were offered for purposes other than to establish paternity as contemplated under subdivision (b)(2). Herndon v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 291

                        Voluntary Support Agreement Used to Establish Right to Inherit. - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.110.html#t110a09s110-132" target="_blank">G.S. 110-132</a></cite> does not imply that voluntary support agreements
                        are strictly limited such that they may have no legal implications other than that of child support; it acknowledges that voluntary support agreements, when properly acknowledged and approved by a trial court, have the same force
                        and effect as a trial court's order of support. Accordingly, a voluntary support agreement could be used to establish that an out-of-wedlock child was entitled to inherit under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>.

                    <p>
                        Decedent's out-of-wedlock child was entitled to inherit under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)(2)</a></cite>. The decedent had acknowledged in a voluntary support agreement that he was
                        the child's father; the agreement was executed by a notary, who was a certifying officer; and it was filed during both the decedent's and the child's lifetimes with the clerk of superior court in the decedent's county. In re Estate
                        of Potts, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 651 S.E.2d 297 (2007).

                        Action by Father Required to Include Illegitimate Child. - Just as a father must act to exclude a legitimate child from sharing in his estate, he must also act to include an illegitimate child. The distinction is an important one. Herndon v. Robinson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 291 S.E.2d 305, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 223 (1982).

                    <p>
                        Applicability of Subsection (d). - Subsection (d) of this section is clear in its meaning and applies only when the child is taking under a will from the putative father and not when the putative father or his heirs are attempting to inherit from the
                        child under the intestacy statutes. Estate of Stern v. Stern, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 311 S.E.2d 909 (1984).

                        This section confers upon illegitimate children same rights enjoyed by legitimate children under laws of intestate succession once there is proper adjudication or acknowledgment of paternity. Notification of the personal representative within six months
                        of published notice to creditors does not establish or define the illegitimate child's right, but merely sets a time limitation for an illegitimate child to seek its enforcement. Jefferys v. Tolin,

                        Subsection (b) is Statute of Limitation. - The six-month limitation period in subsection (b), relating to notice of the claim of an illegitimate child to take from father's estate, is a statute of limitation which is subject to being tolled under the
                        provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa03s1-17" target="_blank">G.S. 1-17</a></cite>. Jefferys v. Tolin, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 368 S.E.2d 201

                    <p>
                        Father's Right to Inherit from Illegitimate Child Established. - Because a father acknowledged himself to be his daughter's father in a parenting agreement filed in the county where the mother and daughter were residents and because the agreement was
                        acknowledged by all parties and approved by a district court judge, the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19" target="_self">G.S. 29-19</a></cite> were followed and the father was an
                        heir of the daughter's estate. In re Estate of Mangum, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 211, 713 S.E.2d 18 (2011).

                        Paternity Established. - By presenting a DNA test, plaintiff established the decedent's paternity at a probability of 99.99%. Because there was no evidence in the record contradicting the evidence offered by plaintiff, the trial court did not err in granting
                        summary judgment on plaintiff's paternity claim. Swint v. Doe, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 827 S.E.2d 309 (2019).

                            Purpose. - The reason for granting the surviving spouse an election or choice is to prevent such spouse from being rendered penniless and turned out of doors by reason of a small net estate or an insolvent estate. Smith v. Smith,

                            A surviving spouse is given this election so as not to be rendered penniless and would elect this option when the estate is small or insolvent. Taylor v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 271 S.E.2d 296

                            Trial court erred in admitting the testimony of the brother's wife about conversations she had with decedent, and about conversations she overheard between decedent and the brother; since the wife was an interested party because she stood to inherit the
                            property the brother was seeking if his specific performance action to enforce decedent's contract to make a will in the brother's favor was resolved in the brother's favor, she was barred from testifying about what a dead

                            Present Right of Possession Not Conferred. - A wife is not a real party in interest so as to interpose as a defense or counterclaim in an action in ejectment instituted by her husband's grantee that her husband had fraudulently conveyed the lands without
                            her joinder in order to deprive her of the possession thereof, since <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a02s29-14" target="_self">G.S. 29-14</a></cite>, defining the share of the surviving spouse of

                            is to give the surviving spouse ample opportunity to make a decision as to which choice is most beneficial. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).

                            Subdivision (c)(4) Authorizes Fixing of Time for Election Where Litigation Is Pending. - Subdivision (c)(4) contemplates that the outcome of the litigation may well determine whether the surviving spouse will elect to take a life estate. Therefore, it
                            authorizes the surviving spouse, if such litigation is pending, to request of the clerk a written order allowing a reasonable time within which the notice of election and the proceedings pursuant thereto may be filed and instituted.
                            Upon such request, it becomes the duty of the clerk forthwith to make a written order fixing a time within which an election may be filed in accordance with subsection (c). Smith v. Smith,

                            "Share" under Subdivision (c)(4) Means Any Share Spouse Is Entitled to. - As used in subdivision (c)(4), "share" means such share in the estate (not necessarily the net estate or property) as the surviving spouse shall be entitled to take by any provision
                            of this Chapter. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).

                            (c)(4). Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).

                            Such as Suit on Disputed Claim Large Enough to Render Estate Insolvent. - If there is a disputed claim which, if allowed, would render the estate insolvent or nearly so, and which, if disallowed, would leave a large net estate, the outcome of the suit
                            on the claim would affect the share of the surviving spouse and might well determine the matter of election, though the subject of the litigation is a mere debt and not the title to land. Smith v. Smith,

                            interest in his deceased father's lands, on the ground that she had defrauded him, the outcome of the litigation would affect her choice or election, i.e., her share of the estate. The pendency of the litigation extended her
                            time for making the election. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).

                            constitute "pending" litigation within the meaning of subdivision (c)(4) of this section. Heller v. Heller, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 171 S.E.2d 335 (1969).
