Hence, upon the resignation, there was no one legally entitled to hold office by virtue of an election, nor under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.128.html#t128a01s128-7" target="_blank">G.S. 128-7</a></cite> was there an incumbent with the legal right to continue in office until a successor was elected or appointed.

       Elections for Judicial Offices 2018.

      - Session Laws 2017-214, s. 4(a), eliminated party primary elections for candidates for Justice of the Supreme Court, Judges of the Court of Appeals, superior court judges, and district court judges, for the November 6, 2018, general election, and s. 4(b)-(k) of that act provides for notices of candidacy, requirements, a timeline, filing fees, and method of determining the winner of each race. For full text of Session Laws 2017-214, s. 4(a)-(k), see note at G.S. 163A-970.

     <p>
      Session Laws 2018-3, s. 2(a)-(d), as amended by Session Laws 2018-130, ss. 2, 3, provides: "The General Assembly finds that both chambers of the General Assembly have carefully examined judicial redistricting and the forms of judicial selection with multiple committees considering various proposals of selection and new judicial district maps. The General Assembly finds that, to allow for more time to thoughtfully consider these changes, the General Assembly enacted S.L. 2017-214, the Electoral Freedom Act of 2017, which, among other items, provided for a one-time cancellation of partisan primaries for the offices of district court judge, superior court judge, judges of the Court of Appeals, and Supreme Court justices for the 2018 election cycle. The General Assembly finds that all elections for judges in 2018 were to be treated uniformly under S.L. 2017-214, the Electoral Freedom Act of 2017, while those changes were considered.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The General Assembly notes that election to these offices will be held under a plurality election system, with candidates running under a political party label on the ballot, without having gone through a party primary. The General Assembly finds that ballot language above the sections of election ballots regarding these impacted offices setting forth that the listed party affiliation is only the self-identified party of a candidate at the time of filing will aid voters' understanding of the 2018 judicial races.

      "(b) For the 2018 general election, the State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement shall, notwithstanding G.S. 163A-1114(b)(2), list the following judicial offices at the end of all partisan offices listed on the general election ballot:
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      "No primaries for judicial office were held in 2018. The information listed by each of the following candidates' names indicates only the candidates' party affiliation or unaffiliated status on their voter registration at the time they filed to run for office.
     </p>
     <p>

       - In a challenge brought by a class of over 222,000 individuals, the members of the court disclosed the information pertaining to members of their families who either were or might be members of plaintiff class; and those justices were disqualified from participating in the consideration and decision of the case unless their participation was consented to in writing by the parties and their counsel. Because a minimum of four justices was necessary to constitute a quorum to transact the business of the court, the parties to that proceeding would be denied an opportunity to be heard for lack of a quorum in the absence of further action by the parties or the court.

        Length of Service of Supreme Court Justice.
       </b>
       - Upon taking office as an Associate Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, a justice was entitled to have his service as Director and Assistant Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts to be taken into account in calculating his service for longevity purposes, but his service as assistant district attorney could not be taken into account. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Thomas W. Ross, Director, The Administrative Office of the Courts, 1999 N.C. AG LEXIS 28 (9/28/99).

       Adoption of Rule Regarding Limitation of Proceedings Did Not Affect Action Already Pending.
   
   - Given the unique constitutional and statutory responsibilities of the Supreme Court of North Carolina to promulgate rules of appellate procedure, as well as rules and standards of conduct for the judiciary, the Supreme Court of North Carolina did not exceed its authority in adopting N.C. Code Jud. Conduct Limitation of Proceedings; however, where a judicial disciplinary action was already pending when N.C. Code Jud. Conduct Limitation of Proceedings came into effect, the action was not barred. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge (Brown), <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 711</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 502 (2004).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Court of Appeals is created effective January 1, 1967. It shall consist initially of six judges, elected by the qualified voters of the State for terms of eight years. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall designate one of the judges as Chief Judge, to serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the Chief Justice. Before entering upon the duties of his office, a judge of the Court of Appeals shall take the oath of office prescribed for a judge of the General Court of Justice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governor on or after July 1, 1967, shall make temporary appointments to the six initial judgeships. The appointees shall serve until January 1, 1969. Their successors shall be elected at the general election for members of the General Assembly in November, 1968, and shall take office on January 1, 1969, to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term which began on January 1, 1967.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the appointment of at least five judges, and the designation of a Chief Judge, the court is authorized to convene, organize, and promulgate, subject to the approval of the Supreme Court, such supplementary rules as it deems necessary and appropriate for the discharge of the judicial business lawfully assigned to it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Effective January 1, 1969, the number of judges is increased to nine, and the Governor, on or after March 1, 1969, shall make temporary appointments to the additional judgeships thus created. The appointees shall serve until January 1, 1971. Their successors shall be elected at the general election for members of the General Assembly in November, 1970, and shall take office on January 1, 1971, to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term which began on January 1, 1969.
     </p>
     <p>
      Effective January 1, 1977, the number of judges is increased to 12; and the Governor, on or after July 1, 1977, shall make temporary appointments to the additional judgeships thus created. The appointees shall serve until January 1, 1979. Their successors shall be elected at the general election for members of the General Assembly in November, 1978, and shall take office on January 1, 1979, to serve the remainder of the unexpired term which began on January 1, 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      On or after December 15, 2000, the Governor shall appoint three additional judges to increase the number of judges to 15.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court of Appeals shall sit in panels of three judges each and may also sit en banc to hear or rehear any cause upon a vote of the majority of the judges of the court. The Chief Judge insofar as practicable shall assign the members to panels in such fashion that each member sits a substantially equal number of times with each other member, shall preside when a member of a panel, and shall designate the presiding judge of the other panel or panels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as may be provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-32" target="_self">G.S. 7A-32</a></cite>, three judges shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of the business of the court when sitting in panels of three judges, and a majority of the then sitting judges on the Court of Appeals shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of the business of the court when sitting en banc.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the Chief Judge is unable, on account of absence or temporary incapacity, to perform the duties placed upon him as Chief Judge, the Chief Justice shall appoint an acting Chief Judge from the other judges of the Court, to temporarily discharge the duties of Chief Judge.

      Session Laws 2018-3, s. 2(a)-(d), as amended by Session Laws 2018-130, ss. 2, 3, provides: "The General Assembly finds that both chambers of the General Assembly have carefully examined judicial redistricting and the forms of judicial selection with multiple committees considering various proposals of selection and new judicial district maps. The General Assembly finds that, to allow for more time to thoughtfully consider these changes, the General Assembly enacted S.L. 2017-214, the Electoral Freedom Act of 2017, which, among other items, provided for a one-time cancellation of partisan primaries for the offices of district court judge, superior court judge, judges of the Court of Appeals, and Supreme Court justices for the 2018 election cycle. The General Assembly finds that all elections for judges in 2018 were to be treated uniformly under S.L. 2017-214, the Electoral Freedom Act of 2017, while those changes were considered.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The General Assembly notes that election to these offices will be held under a plurality election system, with candidates running under a political party label on the ballot, without having gone through a party primary. The General Assembly finds that ballot language above the sections of election ballots regarding these impacted offices setting forth that the listed party affiliation is only the self-identified party of a candidate at the time of filing will aid voters' understanding of the 2018 judicial races.

      "(b) For the 2018 general election, the State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement shall, notwithstanding G.S. 163A-1114(b)(2), list the following judicial offices at the end of all partisan offices listed on the general election ballot:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Justices of the Supreme Court.

      "(c) Notwithstanding G.S. 163A-1112, immediately prior to the placement of the judicial offices listed in subsection (b) of this section on the ballot, the following information shall be printed:
     </p>
     <p>
      "No primaries for judicial office were held in 2018. The information listed by each of the following candidates' names indicates only the candidates' party affiliation or unaffiliated status on their voter registration at the time they filed to run for office.

       Amendment Held Unconstitutional.
   
   - Amendment to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa04s7A-16" target="_self">G.S. 7A-16</a></cite> effected by Session Laws 2000-67, s. 15.5, which expanded the size of the state Court of Appeals from 12 judges to 15 and which allowed the newly appointed judges to serve until the year 2005 before being required to face a retention election, was unconstitutional to the extent that it conflicted with the provisions of N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19, requiring a judge appointed to a judicial vacancy to stand for election at the next general election; remaining portions of the amendment by Session Laws 2000-67 were constitutional and could properly be severed from the unconstitutional clause. Pope v. Easley, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 544</cite>, 556 S.E.2d 265 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       In enacting the provisions in Session Laws 2000-67, G.S. 15.5, making the creation of the new judgeships effective upon gubernatorial appointment and allowing the appointees to serve for nearly four years before facing election, the General Assembly devised a statutory framework that does not comport with the limitation in N.C. Const. art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19, requiring that judicial appointees hold their places only until the next election for members of the General Assembly; section 15.5.(a) operated to create a vacancy at the Court of Appeals, thereby requiring an election to fill the vacancy in the 2002 election cycle. Pope v. Easley, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 544</cite>, 556 S.E.2d 265 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The addition of three new Court of Appeals judgeships by Session Laws 2000-67 was constitutionally permissible and severable from the unconstitutional provision of that act. Pope v. Easley, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 544</cite>, 556 S.E.2d 265 (2001).

      <p>
       Jurisdiction of Court of Appeals.
   
   - Court of Appeals of North Carolina had jurisdiction to consider a claimant's constitutional challenge to an act of the North Carolina General Assembly on appeal from a final decision and order of the North Carolina Industrial Commission because the claimant's constitutional challenge was not required to be heard by a three-judge panel of the Superior Court of Wake County, North Carolina. In re Redmond, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 490</cite>, 797 S.E.2d 275 (2017).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeals in Civil Causes Distinguished from Appeals in Criminal Causes.
   
   - The constitutional and statutory structure of the General Court of Justice provides that, generally, appeals from the district court in civil causes go to the Court of Appeals, while appeals in criminal causes must first go to the superior court. State v. Killian, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 212 S.E.2d 419 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court Has Authority to Give Relief for Error of Law.
   
   - Supreme Court has authority to review the record on appeal and to give appropriate relief for an error of law committed by the trial court. State v. Lampkins, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 497</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 106 (1975), cert. denied, 428 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 3220, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1216 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       But No Authority to Grant Relief from Criminal Trial Free from Error of Law.
   
   - Supreme Court has no authority to grant relief to a defendant convicted of a criminal offense in a trial free from an error of law for the reason that it disagrees with the jury concerning the credibility of a witness for the State. State v. Lampkins, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 497</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 106 (1975), cert. denied, 428 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 3220, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1216 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court must accept as conclusive the verdict of the jury
   
   so far as the credibility of witnesses is concerned. State v. Lampkins, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 497</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 106 (1975), cert. denied, 428 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 3220, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1216 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Objections and Exceptions Necessary to Preserve Legal Questions on Appeal.
   
   - Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on appeal is limited to questions of law or legal inference, which ordinarily must be presented by objections duly entered and exceptions duly taken to the rulings of the lower court. State v. Hedrick, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 232</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 350 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Findings of Trial Court Are Conclusive on Appeal.
   
   - Where evidence properly in the record fully supports the findings of fact which the trial court made, and the record itself does not disclose that these findings were based on information obtained by the trial judge in a manner violative of plaintiff's rights, the trial court's findings are conclusive on appeal. Horton v. Horton, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 183 S.E.2d 794, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 727</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 884 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not the function of the Court of Appeals to make findings of fact.
   
   Horton v. Horton, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 183 S.E.2d 794, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 727</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 884 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction to entertain a motion for summary judgment
   
   made for the first time on appeal. Britt v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 399, 183 S.E.2d 303 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of Appeals Without Jurisdiction.
   
   - Court of appeals was without jurisdiction to consider estates' appeal, arguing that the Eugenics Asexualization and Sterilization Compensation Program was unconstitutional, because, pursuant to the Compensation Program and the Tort Claims Act, the North Carolina Industrial Commission was constituted a court for resolution of the matters; the appropriate procedure was for the Commission to transfer the action to the Superior Court of Wake County for resolution by a three-judge panel. In re Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 785 S.E.2d 111 (2016).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicability.
   
   - Because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27</a></cite> governed appeals of right in ordinary civil actions, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-29ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-29(a)</a></cite>, which applied generally to appeals from the North Carolina Industrial Commission and other administrative agencies, did not apply to estates' appeal arguing that the Eugenics Asexualization and Sterilization Compensation Program was unconstitutional.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition for Writ of Certiorari Granted.
   
   - Because the court of appeals did not state the procedure for review, the trial court did not enter an appealable order, and defendant did not seek entry of such an order by mandamus, defendant was not entitled to appeal as a matter of right; however, defendant petitioned for review by certiorari, and the court of appeals granted his petition for writ of certiorari in its discretion. State v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 725, 783 S.E.2d 279 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's written notice of appeal was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the appellate court to review the criminal judgment. However, because defendant's written notice of appeal was limited to the criminal judgment, defendant's written notice of appeal was therefore insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court to review the civil judgment against defendant for attorneys' fees, but the court issued a writ of certiorari to review the issues pertaining to the civil judgment for attorneys' fees. State v. Bowman, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 3, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant lost the statutory right to appeal a civil judgment against defendant imposing attorney's fees because defendant's notice of appeal was defective, the appellate court was satisfied that defendant was diligent in prosecuting the appeal by providing the written notice. Furthermore, because defendant's argument on the issue of attorney's fees was meritorious, the appellate court, in its discretion, allowed defendant's petition for writ of certiorari and issued a writ of certiorari to review the civil judgment of attorney's fees. State v. Corpening, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Feb. 18, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Standard of Review.
   
   - Pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27</a></cite>, trial court properly applied a de novo standard of review in a land use appeal when it reversed a decision by a village and its board of adjustment, prohibiting a property owner from using his private property as a shooting range, as the land use ordinance in place at the time that he bought the property did not bar shooting ranges and he did not materially alter the prior non-conforming use. Land v. Vill. of Wesley Chapel, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. App.</cite> 123, 697 S.E.2d 458 (2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An order is immediately appealable if
   
   the order affects a substantial right and the loss of that right will injure the party appealing if not corrected prior to final judgment. Travco Hotels, Inc. v. Piedmont Natural Gas Co., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 659, 403 S.E.2d 593, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 288</cite>, 420 S.E.2d 426 (1992).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reliance upon a substantial rights analysis as the basis for appellate review
   
   appears contrary to the plain and unambiguous language of the statutes governing criminal appeals. State v. Shoff, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 456 S.E.2d 875 (1995), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 572</cite>, 460 S.E.2d 328 (1995), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 638</cite>, 466 S.E.2d 277 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to appeal is available through two channels.
   
   <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 54(b) allows appeal if there has been a final judgment as to all of the claims and parties, or if the specific action of the trial court from which appeal is taken is final and the trial judge expressly determines that there is no just reason for delaying the appeal. The second channel to an appeal is by way of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> or this section; an appeal will be permitted under these statutes if a substantial right would be affected by not allowing appeal before final judgment. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 206, 334 S.E.2d 506, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 389</cite>, 338 S.E.2d 878 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Finality Requirement.
   
   - The statutes setting forth the appeals process do not include the same jurisdictional "finality" requirement as does the federal statute. Goldston v. AMC, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 723</cite>, 392 S.E.2d 735 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> and this section, considered together, provide that no appeal lies to an appellate court from an interlocutory judgment unless that ruling deprives the appellant of a substantial right which it would lose if the ruling were not reviewed before final judgment. State ex rel. Employment Sec. Comm'n v. IATSE Local 574, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 442 S.E.2d 339 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no "substantial interest" exception present
   
   to permit appeal under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> and this section of a court's order denying defendant's summary judgment. Cagle v. Teachy, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 244, 431 S.E.2d 801 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeals from other than final judgments are not absolutely barred
   
   by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 54(b) and subsection (c) of this section. Estrada v. Jaques, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 321 S.E.2d 240 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal from order granting stay of declaratory action.
   
   - Because the issues in this insurance case affected a substantial right that could be lost absent immediate appeal, the appeal from the trial court's interlocutory order granting a stay of the declaratory action pending a final resolution of the underlying malpractice action was properly before the court. Cinoman v. Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 481, 764 S.E.2d 619 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        For all practical purposes there is an unlimited right of appeal
   
   in North Carolina to the Appellate Division of the General Court of Justice from any final judgment of the superior court or the district court in civil and criminal cases. State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 324, 172 S.E.2d 217 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to appeal must be exercised in accordance with the established rules
   
   of practice and procedure. State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 324, 172 S.E.2d 217 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Right to Appeal From Guilty Plea.
   
   - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(b)</a></cite> does not provide a route for appeals from guilty pleas. State v. Mungo, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 713 S.E.2d 542 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court was unable to review whether a trial court abused its discretion by entering a special condition of probation that defendant could not have been employed in any type of law enforcement while on probation; there was no right of appeal under this section because defendant entered an Alford plea. State v. Sale, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 754 S.E.2d 474 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's forfeiture appeal was dismissed because defendant (1) gave no timely appeal notice and (2) could not seek certiorari review for "failure to take timely action," as, inter alia, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(b)</a></cite> provided no guilty plea appeal. State v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 196, 768 S.E.2d 196 (2015).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This statute should be strictly construed
   
   for the purpose of eliminating the unnecessary delay and expense of fragmented appeals and of presenting the whole case for determination in a single appeal from a final judgment. Buchanan v. Rose, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 296 S.E.2d 508 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Particular Facts and Procedural Context Must Be Considered.
   
   - It is usually necessary to resolve the question of whether an appeal is premature in each case by considering the particular facts of that case and the procedural context in which the order from which appeal is sought was entered. Bernick v. Jurden, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 435</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 405 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Appeal from Voluntary Election to Serve Sentence.
   
   - Where the trial court activated defendant's sentence upon his voluntary election to serve the sentence in lieu of the remainder of his probation and not "as a result of a finding of a violation of probation," defendant had no right to appeal from his activated sentence. State v. Ikard, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 450 S.E.2d 927 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Request for additional sentencing credit.
   
   - Defendant's request for additional sentencing credit was not properly before the appellate court because the issue of additional sentencing credit was a matter for administrative action, as provided by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html#t15a19As15-196.4" target="_blank">G.S. 15-196.4</a></cite>, rather than a subject for appeal; the proper procedure to obtain additional credit was for defendant to initially have presented her claim to the trial court. State v. Cloer, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 716, 678 S.E.2d 399 (2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court did not order a new trial,
   
   a property owner and owners' association were not entitled to an interlocutory appeal of the trial court's order requiring other lot owners in a subdivision to be joined as necessary parties; the trial court's decree to rehear evidence was not an order for a new trial because a judgment had not been rendered in the case. Regency Lake Owners' Ass'n v. Regency Lake, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 814 S.E.2d 121 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Counsel.
   
   - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-450" target="_self">G.S. 7A-450</a></cite> et seq. has generally been construed to limit the right to appointed counsel in criminal cases to direct appeals taken as of right. Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty to Dismiss Appeal.
   
   - It is the duty of an appellate court to dismiss an appeal if there is no right to appeal. Pasour v. Pierce, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 265 S.E.2d 652 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an appealing party has no right to appeal, an appellate court should on its own motion dismiss the appeal even though the question of appealability has not been raised by the parties themselves. Metcalf v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 265 S.E.2d 484 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Court would address plaintiffs' appeal, which was not certified pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 54(b),
   
   finding that plaintiffs have a substantial right to have the liability of all defendants determined in one proceeding. Camp v. Leonard, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 515 S.E.2d 909 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal from North Carolina Business Court.
   
   - Dismissal of an appeal was appropriate because the Court of Appeals of North Carolina lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, in that the appeal was from a final judgment of the North Carolina Business Court, but appeals from final judgments rendered in the North Carolina Business Court were statutorily mandated to be brought in the Supreme Court of North Carolina. Christenbury Eye Ctr., P.A. v. Medflow, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 237, 783 S.E.2d 264 (2016), review dismissed, as moot, writ granted, 793 S.E.2d 218, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 825 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        North Carolina Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear appeal from the North Carolina Business Court because statutory amendments directing such appeals to the North Carolina Supreme Court became effective after the case was designated as a complex business case. USA Trouser, S.A. de C.V. v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 192, 812 S.E.2d 373 (2018).

        State's Appeal of Expunction Order.

It is not the Supreme Court's role to expand <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15Aa05s15A-145.5" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-145.5</a></cite> to include the right to appeal an expunction order, or to construe <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27</a></cite> as governing procedure in a criminal matter not clearly brought under that statute's provisions authorizing appeals of right from the trial courts.

        Substantial evidence in the record supported an administrative law judge's findings
   
   and its dismissal of a day care's petition for a contested case hearing where the day care filed nothing in nearly six months following the filing of the petition, despite receiving several orders from the administrative law judge to file and serve prehearing statements and other responses to motions.

        Right to Appeal Not Forfeited.
   
   - Decedent's nieces and nephews did not forfeit their right to appeal a consent judgment by not taking an immediate appeal of an interlocutory order granting motions to dismiss filed by a personal representative and entities because the nieces and nephews gave timely notice of appeal after entry of the final consent judgment; order dismissing the entities did not resolve all claims or all rights and liabilities of all parties and was not a final order under G.S. 1A-1-54(b). Stanford v. Paris, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 306</cite>, 698 S.E.2d 37 (Aug. 27, 2010).

        Imposition of Satellite-Based Monitoring.
   
   - Defendant's appeal challenging imposition of satellite-based monitoring (SBM) was considered as a petition for writ of certiorari and addressed on the merits because, although defendant's oral notice of appeal was insufficient, at the time of his SBM hearing, defendant did not have any indication that notice of appeal pursuant to N.C. R. App. P. 4(a)(1) was improper. State v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. App.</cite> 300, 697 S.E.2d 428 (2010).

        Steps on Appeal.
   
   - While convictions that result in a judgment of death are automatically appealable to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, all other convictions are properly appealed to the Court of Appeals pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27</a></cite> and N.C. R. App. P. 4(d), and while neither party filed a motion to bypass the Court of Appeals as to defendant's non-capital conviction for burglary, when he appealed his conviction for murder and his death sentence, the Supreme Court of North Carolina, on its own initiative, and consistently with N.C. R. App. P. 2, considered defendant's assignments of error that concerned his burglary conviction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIVa14s14-51" target="_blank">G.S. 14-51</a></cite> because the issue also related to one of his arguments regarding an aggravating circumstance. State v. Elliott, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 400</cite>, 628 S.E.2d 735 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial Right Not Affected.
   
   - Because the order appealed from did not affect substantial right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27</a></cite>, and there was no pending petition for a writ of certiorari, defendant's appeal from a trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss an order to show cause was subject to dismissal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. State v. Oakes, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 580, 771 S.E.2d 832 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs' statement of grounds for review was insufficient to establish that the challenged order affected a substantial right; they asserted in a single sentence that all claims involved the same facts and questions, without explaining how or why a jury's consideration of those facts in various state and federal claims could lead to irreconcilable results, plus plaintiffs also relied on a published case they said was controlling, but whether a ruling affected a substantial right had to be determined on a case-by-case basis.

        North Carolina Industrial Commission.
   
   - Because, pursuant to the Eugenics Asexualization and Sterilization Compensation Program and the Tort Claims Act, the statute controlled estates' appeal, the North Carolina Industrial Commission had to be included when the statute referred to "court," "trial court," "district court," or "superior court."

          Some of the notes below were decided under subsection (a) of this section prior to the amendment in 1995, which deleted reference to life imprisonment from the subsection.

       <p>
        The term "imprisonment for life"
   
   as it is used in this section means only a determinate life sentence and does not include an indeterminate sentence merely because the stated maximum is a life term. State v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 157</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 210 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Death Sentence Affirmed.
   
   - Defendant's murder conviction and death sentence were affirmed as (1) there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to deny defendant's ex parte motion that a doctor be appointed as an expert on substance induced mood disorder; (2) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion in limine seeking to exclude his prior conviction for malicious wounding; (3) there was no error in the trial court's refusal to peremptorily instruct the jury on the defendant's requested mitigating circumstances; (4) the evidence fully supported the aggravating circumstances found by the jury; (5) there was no indication the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; and (6) the sentence of death was neither disproportionate nor excessive. Therefore, the defendant received a fair trial and capital sentencing proceeding, free from prejudicial error. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 382</cite>, 584 S.E.2d 278 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1194, 124 S. Ct. 1447, 158 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the jury's findings that defendant acted with cruelty when he killed his wife with a shotgun while his stepson was sitting next to her, and then shot his stepson with the same shotgun shortly thereafter, and the state supreme court affirmed the trial court's judgments finding defendant guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and imposing the death penalty for each conviction. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 330</cite>, 595 S.E.2d 124 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an appeal as of right with regard to the imposition of a sentence of death against a defendant following a jury trial, which resulted in his conviction for the first-degree murder of a police officer while in the performance of his duties, the defendant's conviction and sentence was upheld as the defendant failed to show any trial error with regard to the jury selection challenges he raised on appeal; the trial court did not commit prejudicial error when it denied a jury request to review certain exhibits as they were admitted solely for the purpose of illustrating an expert's testimony and the jury already had seen the exhibits in their entirety and there was some inadmissible material in the exhibits; the trial court did not err by denying his motion for a mistrial, made when law enforcement officers approached the jury box to purportedly block the victim's mother from seeing autopsy photographs, as the trial court acted promptly and effectively to regain control of the courtroom and the reviewing court would not second-guess the trial court to presume that the incident was fatally prejudicial; the evidence presented was sufficient for the jury to find that the defendant's use of the victim's gun was inseparable from the taking of it and the defendant's efforts to flee, thus, the trial court did not err by denying his motion to dismiss the charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon; and, the sentence of death was not disproportionate, excessive or influenced by passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor since the evidence showed that despite the kneeling victim's pleas for mercy, the defendant fatally shot him multiple times. State v. Maness, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 261</cite>, 677 S.E.2d 796 (2009).

        Petitions to Review Judgments in Habeas Corpus Proceedings.
   
   - By analogy, subsection (a) of this section, G.S. 15-180.2 (now repealed) and N.C.R.A.P., Rule 21(b) are logically applicable to petitions for certiorari to review judgments in habeas corpus proceedings involving the restraint of prisoners under sentences of death or life imprisonment. State v. Niccum, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 276</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 141 (1977).

   - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIXa53s15A-979" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-979</a></cite> does not specify whether an appeal lies to the Court of Appeals or to the Supreme Court. Subsection (a) of this section, however, stipulates that there is an appeal of right to the Supreme Court from a superior court judgment imposing a sentence of death or life imprisonment. When these two statutes are considered together, it is proper to appeal directly to the Supreme Court if the punishment for the charge(s) is either death or life imprisonment. State v. Silhan, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 636</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 902 (1978).

       <p>
        "Final Judgment" Defined.
   
   - A final judgment is one which disposes of the cause as to all the parties, leaving nothing to be judicially determined between them in the trial court. Atkins v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 33, 279 S.E.2d 866 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A party may properly appeal only from a final order,
   
   which disposes of all the issues as to all parties, or an interlocutory order affecting a substantial right of the appellant. Buffington v. Buffington, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 317 S.E.2d 97 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Order Authorizing Foreclosure is Final Judgment.
   
   - Trial court's order authorizing a foreclosure to proceed under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.045.html#t45a2As45-21.16ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 45-21.16(d)</a></cite> was a final judgment of the superior court, and, therefore, the court of appeals had jurisdiction to hear the mortgagor's appeal pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(b)</a></cite>. In re Foreclosure by David A. Simpson, P.C., <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 711 S.E.2d 165 (2011).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Application for Certiorari Is Not Final Judgment.
   
   - A "judgment" of the superior court denying defendant's application to that court for a writ of certiorari to review the proceedings of the district court in a criminal case was not a final judgment within the meaning of subsection (b) of this section, and defendant was not authorized to appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeals as a matter of right; defendant's only remedy was by petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals. State v. Flynt, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 174 S.E.2d 120 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal from Final Judgment.
   
   - As a trial court's memorandum of decision and judgment was a final judgment of the superior court, an appellate court exercised jurisdiction over plaintiff's appeal pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(b)</a></cite>. Phelps Staffing, LLC v. S.C. Phelps, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 720 S.E.2d 785 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant's defective notice of appeal required dismissal of defendant's appeal of a criminal conviction, defendant was allowed to pursue a writ of certiorari because (1) defendant had a right to appeal the judgment, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27</a></cite>, and (2) the appellate court had the discretion to grant such a petition. State v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 752 S.E.2d 223 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal from Order of Superior Court Affirming Annexation Ordinance.
   
   - By this section initial appellate jurisdiction of an appeal from an order of the superior court affirming an annexation ordinance is given to the Court of Appeals, subject, however, to the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-31" target="_self">G.S. 7A-31</a></cite>. Adams-Millis Corp. v. Town of Kernersville, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 147</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 704 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal from Order Affirming Zoning Board's Decision.
   
   - Superior court fully resolved the merits of the parties' zoning dispute and remanded the matter only for the zoning board to schedule petitioner's compliance with her permit. Because the superior court's order affirming the board's stop work order left nothing more to be resolved in the superior court, the order was a final order for purposes of appeal. Thompson v. Town of White Lake, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 237, 797 S.E.2d 346 (2017).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal from Decision of Board of Medical Examiners.
   
   - Court of Appeals is proper court to determine appeals taken from decisions of superior court in proceedings for judicial review of decisions of the Board of Medical Examiners under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(b)</a></cite>; Court of Appeals erred in dismissing appeal under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a01s90-14.11" target="_blank">G.S. 90-14.11</a></cite>, since generally accepted rule is that where there is irreconcilable conflict between two statutes, later statute controls as the last expression of legislative intent, and therefore, later enacted statute, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(b)</a></cite>, controlled in case. In re Guess, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 105</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 8 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1047, 111 S. Ct. 754, 112 L. Ed. 2d 774 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal Where Question of Attorney's Fees is Reserved.
   
   - Once a trial court entered judgment awarding alimony to a wife, but reserving the question of attorney's fees, the judgment was final and appealable; the husband was not required to obtain certification for review pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 54. Duncan v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">366 N.C. 544</cite>, 742 S.E.2d 799 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that plaintiff waived her right to appeal order granting summary judgment
   
   to one of three defendants in no way affected her statutory right to appeal from the final judgment, since although she could have appealed the entry of summary judgment as to that defendant, she was not required to do so. Ingle v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 321 S.E.2d 588 (1984), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 508</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 391 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Order Was Final Judgment Despite Reserving Issue for Jury.
   
   - Where the trial court in its "order and partial summary judgment" reserved for the jury the "issue as to whether defendant has waived any objection to, or is estopped to deny, the tenant's renewal of the lease," the order left no further action for the trial court to dispose of the case. Although the order reserved an issue for the jury, the trial court determined that it was irrelevant whether notice was received; therefore, there was no requirement for a trial on the issues of waiver or estoppel, and the order was effectively a final judgment and affected a substantial right. Janus Theatres of Burlington, Inc. v. Aragon, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 534, 410 S.E.2d 218 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment Was Final Where Plaintiff Voluntarily Dismissed Remaining Claims.
   
   - Case was not dismissed because the employee's appeal was from a final judgment and was not interlocutory; the employee voluntarily dismissed the remaining claims as part of a settlement agreement. Tarrant v. Freeway Foods of Greensboro, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 593 S.E.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 739</cite>, 603 S.E.2d 126 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary Judgment Was Final Order Where Remaining Counterclaims Voluntarily Dismissed.
   
   - Trial court had jurisdiction over a contractor's appeal of a summary judgment for a subcontractor on a third party claim since the appeal was filed within 30 days of the owner's voluntary dismissal of the remaining counterclaims against the contractor, which made the previously interlocutory summary judgment a final order. Bost Constr. Co. v. Blondy, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 750 S.E.2d 917 (2013), review denied <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 292</cite>, 753 S.E.2d 780, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 45 (2014), review denied 755 S.E.2d 612, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 195 (N.C. 2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal of Contempt Order Was Permissible.
   
   - Husband had a right to appeal those aspects of the contempt order that the husband alleged impermissibly modified child custody or exceeded the trial court's authority. Jackson v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 665 S.E.2d 545 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Court of Appeals of North Carolina had jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a satellite-based monitoring determination under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa27As14-208.40" target="_blank">G.S. 14-208.40</a></cite>B pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27</a></cite> because the order left nothing further to be judicially determined. State v. Singleton, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 620, 689 S.E.2d 562 (2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Postconviction DNA Testing.
   
   - When defendant's motion for postconviction DNA testing was denied, appeal was the proper avenue for seeking reversal because (1) defendant had a statutory right to appeal such an order, and (2) defendant preserved the issue for appellate review by appealing the denial of the motion. State v. Byers, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 822 S.E.2d 746 (2018).

        "Interlocutory Order" Defined.
   
   - An order is interlocutory if it does not determine the issues but directs some further proceeding preliminary to final decree. Waters v. Qualified Personnel, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 200</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 338 (1978); Blackwelder v. State Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of Proof.
   
   - Because no order was certified as appropriate for immediate appeal, to establish appellate jurisdiction, the insured and insurer bore the burden of demonstrating how each order affected a substantial right and would work injury if not corrected before final judgment. Radiator Specialty Co. v. Arrowood Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 508, 800 S.E.2d 452 (2017).

State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Buck Island, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 536, 581 S.E.2d 122 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where only the issue of damages remained,
   
   no final judgment had been made and no substantial right had been affected, the appellate court found the trial court's certification ineffective and saw no impediment to the trial court's sorting out the various claims and affirmative defenses intertwined with the damages issue. CBP Resources, Inc. v. Mountaire Farms of N.C. Inc., <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 517 S.E.2d 151 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial Right Held Affected.
   
   - Trial court's order did not contain a certification under the rule, but the appeal was proper because plaintiff demonstrated a substantial right that would be lost absent an immediate appeal; a sufficient overlap existed between plaintiff's surviving claim for wrongful discharge and her First Amendment claim that was dismissed, such that there existed a possibility of inconsistent verdicts absent immediate appeal. Holland v. Harrison, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 804 S.E.2d 205 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court had jurisdiction of an insurer's interlocutory appeal of an order finding the insurer provided primary liability coverage to an estate because this implicated a substantial right of the insurer that would be lost absent an immediate appeal, as the estate's decedent was not a named insured under the insurer's policy. Smith v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 40, 819 S.E.2d 610 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family asserted a substantial right to have the liability of all defendants be determined in one proceeding because the same factual issues applied to all claims against the property owner and the tenants, and two trials could bring about inconsistent verdicts relating to the family's damages. Curlee v. Johnson, - N.C. App.
   - , 842 S.E.2d 604 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        When Interlocutory Order Is Appealable Generally.
   
   - Ordinarily, an appeal lies only from a final judgment, but an interlocutory order which will work injury if not corrected before final judgment is appealable. Wachovia Realty Invs. v. Housing, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 93</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 667 (1977); Atkins v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 33, 279 S.E.2d 866 (1981); Perry v.

        This section in effect provides that no appeal lies to an appellate court from an interlocutory order or ruling of the trial judge unless such ruling or order deprives the appellant of a substantial right which he would lose if the ruling or order is not reviewed before final judgment.

        For a defendant to have a right of appeal from a mandatory preliminary injunction, substantial rights of the appellant must be adversely affected. Otherwise, an appeal from such an interlocutory order is subject to being dismissed. Dixon v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 744, 303 S.E.2d 606 (1983).

       <p>
        No appeal lies to an appellate court from an interlocutory order unless the order deprives the appellant of a substantial right which he would lose absent a review prior to final determination. Thus, the threshold question presented by a purported appeal from an order granting a preliminary injunction is whether the appellant has been deprived of any substantial right which might be lost should the order escape appellate review before final judgment. Robins &amp; Weill, Inc. v. Mason, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 320 S.E.2d 693, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 495</cite>, 322 S.E.2d 559 (1984).

        Trial court's dismissal of plaintiffs' claims against aircraft manufacturer affected a substantial right to have determined in a single proceeding, i.e., whether plaintiffs were damaged by the actions of one, some or all defendants where their claims arise upon the same series of transactions, and the appeal from an interlocutory order was considered.

        Court of appeals held that where a trial court dismissed a company's contract claims, but stayed the tort claims: (1) this was an interlocutory order; (2) there was no certification; and (3) the company failed to show a substantial right at stake on appeal.

        Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal by an underinsured motorist insurer because the trial court's order on cross-motions for summary judgment was an interlocutory order, as pending issues remained in the case, and the order did not contain a certification for appeal. Moreover, although the insurer was permitted, but was not required, to participate in the proceedings as an unnamed underinsured motorist carrier, the insurer failed to show a substantial right, which would have been lost absent immediate appellate review. Peterson v. Dillman, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 782 S.E.2d 362 (2016).

        Court of appeals did not review a father's appeal from an order denying his motions seeking post-award discovery because the father failed to demonstrate that he would be deprived of a substantial right without appellate review of the order before a final judgment had been entered.

        Former employee was not entitled to appeal the Business Court's interlocutory order because she did not explain how she would be prejudiced and failed to show that the order affected a substantial right where she did not identify a specific "material right" that she would lose if the order were not reviewed before final judgment or explain how the order in question would "work injury" to her if not immediately reviewed, and merely asserting a preference for a forum other than the Business Court absent a specific, legal entitlement to an exclusion from designation was insufficient to support the former employee's contention that this matter was analogous to a venue change and was therefore immediately appealable. Hanesbrands Inc. v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 216</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 497 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's order setting aside a consent judgment was not immediately appealable because the order was interlocutory since it contemplated further proceedings at the trial level on the issue of just compensation, and the order did not affect a substantial right; the trial court did not certify the order setting aside the consent judgment for immediate appellate review. N.C. DOT v. Laxmi Hotels of Spring Lake, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 817 S.E.2d 62 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's denial of employees' estoppel motion was interlocutory and not appealable, and the employees' appeal thereof was accordingly dismissed, because the employees failed to make the colorable assertion necessary to claim that the denial of their estoppel motion affected a substantial right; the employees nowhere asserted that the prior action upon which they based their estoppel motion reached final judgment on the merits. McCullers v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 828 S.E.2d 524 (2019).

        But Interlocutory Order May Be Appealed If It Affects a Substantial Right.

        Appeal Is Permitted Where a Substantial Right Would Be Affected.
   
   - Where a trial court granted plaintiff summary judgment as to liability on a criminal conversation claim, and granted defendant summary judgment as to an alienation of affections claim, though no final judgment was entered as to the issue of damages for the criminal conversation claim, nor was certification granted under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 54(b) as to the alienation of affections claim, the appeal affected a substantial right that would be lost absent immediate review, because the elements of damages were so closely related that they did not support separate awards for each tort. McCutchen v. McCutchen, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 612 S.E.2d 162 (2005).

        Because a physician's assertions of statutory privilege related directly to the matters to be disclosed under a trial court's interlocutory discovery order, the challenged discovery order affected a substantial right and the physician's interlocutory appeal was properly before the appellate court under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277(a)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(d)(1)</a></cite>.

        North Carolina Court of Appeals accepted the appeal brought by third-party defendants, the North Carolina Division of Forest Resources and North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (now a division of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services), in a wrongful death suit, asserting negligence on the third-party defendants with regard to a forest fire obscuring the vision of travelers on a highway, which led to a multiple vehicle accident, killing a passenger, because the trial court's denial of the third-party defendants' motions to dismiss raised the issues of sovereign immunity and the public duty doctrine, which affected a substantial right sufficient to warrant immediate appellate review. Myers v. McGrady, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 613 S.E.2d 334 (2005), rev'd and remanded, review improvidently allowed, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 460</cite>, 628 S.E.2d 761 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A substantial right is one which
   
   will clearly be lost or irremediably adversely affected if the order is not reviewable before final judgment. In other words, the right to immediate appeal is reserved for those cases in which the normal course of procedure is inadequate to protect the substantial right affected by the order sought to be appealed. Blackwelder v. State Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 331, 299 S.E.2d 777 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The "substantial right" test
   
   for appealability of interlocutory orders is more easily stated than applied. It is usually necessary to resolve the question in each case by considering the particular facts of that case and the procedural context in which the order from which appeal is sought was entered. Blackwelder v. State Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 331, 299 S.E.2d 777 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        No hard and fast rules exist for determining which appeals affect a substantial right. Rather, such decisions usually require consideration of the facts of the particular case. Estrada v. Jaques, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 321 S.E.2d 240 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a substantial right is affected usually depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and the procedural context of the orders appealed from. Estrada v. Jaques, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 321 S.E.2d 240 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        There has evolved a two-part test of the appealability of interlocutory orders under the "substantial right" exception provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277(a)</a></cite> and subdivision (d)(1) of this section. First, the right itself must be "substantial," and second, the enforcement of the substantial right must be lost, prejudiced or less than adequately protected by exception to entry of the interlocutory order. J &amp; B Slurry Seal Co. v. Mid-South Aviation, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 362 S.E.2d 812 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The appealability of interlocutory orders pursuant to the "substantial right" exception is determined by a two-step test. The right itself must be substantial and the deprivation of that substantial right must potentially work injury to plaintiff if not corrected before appeal from final judgment. Miller v. Swann Plantation Dev. Co., <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 399 S.E.2d 137 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Awards Pendente Lite.
   
   - Awards pendente lite are interlocutory decrees which necessarily do not affect a substantial right from which lies an immediate appeal pursuant to this section. Browne v. Browne, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 617, 400 S.E.2d 736 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Facts and circumstances of each case and the procedural context
   
   of the orders appealed from are the determinative factors in deciding whether a "substantial right" is affected. Schneider v. Brunk, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 560, 324 S.E.2d 922 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Avoidance of a rehearing or trial is not a "substantial right"
   
   entitling a party to an immediate appeal. Blackwelder v. State Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 331, 299 S.E.2d 777 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of a motion to dismiss is interlocutory because it simply allows an action to proceed and will not seriously impair any right of defendants that cannot be corrected upon appeal from final judgment, and the avoidance of a trial is not a "substantial right" that would make such an interlocutory order appealable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> or subsection (d) of this section. Howard v. Ocean Trail Convalescent Ctr., <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 494, 315 S.E.2d 97 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Avoidance of a trial is not a substantial right entitling plaintiff to an immediate appeal. Horne v. Nobility Homes, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 363 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court found that the only possible "injury" defendant would suffer if not permitted immediate appellate review was the necessity of proceeding to trial before the matter was reviewed by the appellate court, not the deprivation of a substantial right under this section. Anderson v. Atlantic Cas. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 518 S.E.2d 786 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The necessity of a second trial,
   
   standing alone, does not affect a substantial right. However, in certain cases the appellate courts have held that a plaintiff's right to have all his claims heard before the same jury affects a substantial right. Estrada v. Jaques, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 321 S.E.2d 240 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A party has a "substantial right" to avoid separate trials of the same legal issues.

       </p>
       <p>
        Right to avoid possibility of two trials on same issues can be a substantial right. Davidson v. Knauff Ins. Agency, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 376 S.E.2d 488, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 577</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 772 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a suit for malicious prosecution, in which defendant counterclaimed requesting a constructive trust, a factual issue of whether plaintiff forged defendant's name on a check was central to both actions; denial of appeal from summary judgment against defendant could have resulted in two juries in separate trials reaching different resolutions of this same issue if subsequent trial on the merits and appeal were successful. Consequently, the order dismissing defendant's counterclaim affected a substantial right and appeal was granted. Lamb v. Lamb, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 680, 375 S.E.2d 685 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to avoid the possibility of two trials on the same issues can be a substantial right that permits an appeal of an interlocutory order when there are issues of fact common to the claim appealed and remaining claims. Allen v. Sea Gate Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 761, 460 S.E.2d 197 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under circumstances in which a patient's suit alleged multiple, overlapping acts of medical malpractice resulting in harm, it was best that one jury hear the case to avoid inconsistent verdicts; accordingly, a summary judgment in favor of a radiologist affected a substantial right and the appeal from the summary judgment was considered, despite the fact that the summary judgment was granted as to one but not all of the defendants and the trial court did not certify that there was "no just reason for delay." Burgess v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 480, 642 S.E.2d 478 (2007).

       </p>
       <p>
        But Avoiding Separate Trials of Different Issues Is Not a Substantial Right.
   
   - Simply having all claims determined in one proceeding is not a substantial right. A party has instead the substantial right to avoid two separate trials of the same "issues," but avoiding separate trials of different issues is not a substantial right. J &amp; B Slurry Seal Co. v. Mid-South Aviation, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 362 S.E.2d 812 (1987).

        Appellate Court as Dispatcher of Appeals.
   
   - To the extent that judgments as to one or more but fewer than all parties are determined by the appellate courts of this State to affect a "substantial right" of one of the litigants under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> and subsection (d) of this section, the procedure for trial court certification of such judgments as appealable established in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 54(b) is bypassed and the appellate court is substituted as the true dispatcher of appeals.

        Rule Against Allowing Appeal from Interlocutory Orders Strictly Construed.
   
   - Strict construction of the rule against allowing appeal from an interlocutory order of the trial court serves the purpose of eliminating the unnecessary delay and expense of fragmented appeals and of presenting the whole case for determination in a single appeal from a final judgment.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a criminal case there is no provision in the statute for an appeal to the Court of Appeals as a matter of right from an interlocutory order entered therein. State v.

       <p>
        Dismissal of Interlocutory Appeals.
   
   - The appellate division possesses sufficient authority to dispose of interlocutory appeals which do not affect a substantial right by dismissal. It has express authority to do so on motion of the parties if the appeal is frivolous or is taken solely for purposes of delay. Or it may exercise its general authority in response to motions filed under the general motions provision. Or the appellate division may dismiss upon its own motion as part of its general duty to apply the laws governing the right to appeal. Estrada v. Jaques, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 321 S.E.2d 240 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a workers' compensation proceeding, an appeal by an employer and its insurance carrier was dismissed as interlocutory where the North Carolina Industrial Commission specifically reserved the issue of the amount of the compensation award for the employee. Watts v. Hemlock Homes of the Highlands, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 81, 584 S.E.2d 97 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court did not rule on the merits of an employee's claim for unemployment benefits, but found that the Employment Security Commission's order did not address all of the relevant issues raised by the record, and the findings were incomplete and failed to set out the sequence of events regarding the timing and notification of the employee's discharge, the order was clearly interlocutory; hence, without evidence that the employee's substantial rights were affected, or that any criteria for an immediate appeal was required, the employee's appeal was dismissed. Reeves v. Yellow Transp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 613 S.E.2d 350, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 853</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 511 (2005).

       <p>
        Filing of Motion to Dismiss.
   
   - Ruling on the interlocutory nature of appeals is properly a matter for the appellate division, not the trial court. Since this often requires consideration of the merits, motions to dismiss appeals on grounds of being interlocutory should properly be filed after the record on appeal is filed in the appellate court. Estrada v. Jaques, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 321 S.E.2d 240 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Possibility of Two Trials.
   
   - The right to avoid the possibility of two trials on the same issues can be a substantial right so as to warrant an immediate appeal under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> and subsection (d) of this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where dismissal of appeal as interlocutory could result in two different trials on the same issues, creating the possibility of inconsistent verdicts, a substantial right was prejudiced; therefore, defendant's motion for summary judgment which was granted by the trial court was immediately appealable by plaintiff. Hartman v. Walkertown Shopping Ctr., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 632, 439 S.E.2d 787, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 780</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 422 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where denial of Rule 60(b) motion was in the nature of an interlocutory order
   
   because plaintiff's voluntary dismissal resulted in there being no action pending, and defendants would not suffer the loss of a substantial right absent an appeal, in the court's discretion pursuant to Rules 2 and 21 the appeal was treated as a writ of certiorari. Troy v. Tucker, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 213, 484 S.E.2d 98 (1997).

        Collateral Estoppel Did Not Bar Action.
   
   - Because no court had yet adjudicated the just compensation issue, the North Carolina Department of Transportation could not rely on collateral estoppel to immediately appeal the trial court's order setting aside a consent judgment; the consent judgment prevented the need for litigation, as it was designed to do.

        Order Impacting Sovereign Immunity.
   
   - Denial of a city's summary judgment motion in a wrongful death action, an interlocutory order, was immediately appealable pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(d)(1)</a></cite> because the appeal raised an issue of sovereign immunity.

       <p>
        Denial of an officer's and department's motion for summary judgment grounded on the defense of governmental immunity affected a substantial right and was immediately appealable; with respect to the balance of their arguments, however, the officer and the department showed no substantial right that would have been lost or irreparably prejudiced if the order was not reviewed before final judgment and those arguments were premature. Showalter v. N.C. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 132, 643 S.E.2d 649 (2007).

        Although a trial court's denial of a county board of education's summary judgment motion was an interlocutory order that was generally not appealable at that point in the litigation, as the board was claiming sovereign immunity as a complete defense to an action by a student's mother after the student was denied placement at a school, the order was immediately appealable under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(d)(1)</a></cite>.

        Court of appeals reviewed residents' interlocutory appeal of an order dismissing their complaint against a city pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) because the trial court's stated basis for the dismissal was that the doctrine of governmental immunity applied to the residents' allegations against the city, and the city had not waived its governmental immunity; those grounds were sufficient to warrant immediate appellate review.

        Town's appeal of two orders ruling on motions in a dispute with a county over wastewater disposal was dismissed because the orders were interlocutory, and the town did not show the orders affected substantial rights of governmental immunity, as governmental immunity did not apply to claims arising out of the proprietary operation of the town's sewer system.

        Preliminary Injunction Against Enforcement of a Statute.
   
   -
   When an agent of the State that is charged with enforcing statutes appeals rulings limiting the enforcement of those statutes, the right to enforce the statute is substantial, and the rulings are immediately appealable.

        Grant of Preliminary Injunction.
   
   - Defendants' substantial right to control assets related to the mortgage sale is affected by the preliminary injunction and, thus, the court had jurisdiction to review the defendants' appeal from the preliminary injunction order.

       <p>
        Court of appeals had no jurisdiction to consider an employee's interlocutory appeal of an order issuing a preliminary injunction because the employee failed to establish that the injunction affected a substantial right; the preliminary injunction did not prevent or destroy the employee's ability to earn a living or sustain a livelihood because he continued to have a realistic opportunity to use his skill and talents to generate new client relationships outside the employer's customer list.

        Appeal from Order Granting Motion to Enforce A Preliminary Injunction.
   
   - Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a trial court's order granting a motion to enforce a previously imposed preliminary injunction because the former officers of a corporation failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating the loss of a substantial right absent immediate appeal of the order.

        Change of Venue.
   
   - While the trial court had sufficient information to rule on the timely motion, the trial court's discretionary determination was interlocutory and affected no substantial right of either party, and thus plaintiff's appeal was premature.

       </p>
       <p>
        In cases where a trial court's decision deprives an appellant of a substantial right which would be lost absent immediate review, an appellate court was allowed to review the appeal; motions for change of venue because the county designated was not proper affected a substantial right and were immediately appealable. Hawley v. Hobgood, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 622 S.E.2d 117 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal of the denial of a subcontractor's motions to consolidate actions and to change venue was proper because the right to venue established by statute is a substantial right, the denial of which is immediately appealable; further, a substantial right was affected when the same factual issues would be present in both trials and the possibility of inconsistent verdicts on those issues existed. Barrier Geotechnical Contrs., Inc. v. Radford Quarries of Boone, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 741, 646 S.E.2d 840 (2007).

       <p>
        When plaintiffs filed a negligence suit in Forsyth County, the trial court's order denying defendants' motion for change of venue, though interlocutory, affected a substantial right and was immediately appealable because Forsyth County was not proper; plaintiffs and defendants either resided in or were located in Alamance County. Jenkins v. Hearn Vascular Surgery, P.A., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 719 S.E.2d 151 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's order denying defendants' motion for change of venue was interlocutory, as it was an order made during the pendency of the action, which did not dispose of the case; however, because defendants alleged the county indicated in the complaint was improper, the appellate court addressed the merits of defendants' appeal. TD Bank, N.A. v. Crown Leasing Partners, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 737 S.E.2d 738 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's order denying defendants' motion for change of venue was interlocutory because it did not dispose of all issues of the case and was not a final disposition for any party, and thus the trial court's denial of the motion for change of venue affected a substantial right, and the merits were considered.

        Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Preliminary Injunction.
   
   - The trial court abused its discretion in denying a seller's motion to set the preliminary injunction aside because the seller never received notice of the buyer's intention to seek a preliminary injunction; the lack of notice affected the seller's substantial rights, and the seller's purported attorney of record did not represent the seller in the instant action, thus making service on the attorney insufficient to provide notice to the seller.

        Order Regarding Interrogatories.
   
   - Trial court's order sustaining objections to, and granting a motion to strike, certain interrogatories, denying defendants' motion to compel answers to those interrogatories, and also denying defendants' motion to permit them to respond to plaintiff's request for admissions was interlocutory, and defendants' appeal was fragmentary and premature. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Olive, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 574, 257 S.E.2d 100 (1979).

       <p>
        In a wrongful death action, the defendant declined to answer certain interrogatories on the grounds of self-incrimination, but was ordered to do so by the court, and he appealed. Although this appeal was from an interlocutory order, it was nevertheless authorized, because if some of the interrogatories were incriminating and the defendant was compelled to answer them, his constitutional rights could have been lost beyond recall, and his appeal at the end of the trial would have been of no value. Shaw v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 604, 331 S.E.2d 203, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 669</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 496 (1985).

        Orders Regarding Insurance and the Duty to Defend.
   
   - Insured failed to establish how orders would irreparably affect its substantial right to defense in allegedly pending benzene claims, no order decided the ultimate duty to defend issue, and the insured failed to advance a sufficient argument for expanding the duty to defend substantial right exception, and its appeals were dismissed.

        Order Granting Intervention.
   
   - Although the rule is not absolute, ordinarily no appeal will lie from an order permitting intervention of parties unless the order adversely affects a substantial right which the appellant may lose if not granted an appeal before final judgment. The rule applies with equal vigor without regard to whether the trial court grants a motion to intervene as a matter of right pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 24(a) or as permissive intervention pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 24(b).

        Denial of Motion to Dismiss.
   
   - Ordinarily, there is no right of appeal from the refusal of a motion to dismiss. The refusal to dismiss the action generally will not seriously impair any right of defendant that cannot be corrected upon appeal from final judgment. Godley Auction Co. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was ordered by the trial court through an interlocutory order to pay plaintiff's legal fees, and where defendant did not perfect his appeal from such judgment, defendant did not lose his right to attack the judgment, since the record indicated that the appeal was not taken because of an agreement between the parties' counsel to vacate the order in question. Stroupe v. Stroupe, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 656</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 434 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The order entered by the trial court denying the defendants' motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment was not a final determination of the defendants' rights, even though the trial court stated that "there is no just reason to delay the appeal," and did not affect the defendants' substantial rights. The appeal of the order, therefore, could not lie as of right. Fraser v. Di Santi, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C.

       <p>
        Where the trial court denied employer's motion to dismiss employee's breach of contract suit on the ground of a forum selection clause, finding that the clause was a product of unequal bargaining power, the motion to dismiss was immediately appealable.

       </p>
       <p>
        Order denying a taxpayer's motion to dismiss an administrative summons requesting documents was appealable because it was an intermediate order that involved the merits and affected the final judgment in that if the motion had been granted, the trial court would not have issued the order to comply with the summons. Even if the appeal was not from a final judgment, the appeal of a discovery order asserting a statutory or a common-law privilege affected a substantial right. In re Summons Issued to Ernst &amp; Young, LLP, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C.

P. 12(b)(6) did not affect a substantial right and was not immediately appealable, even though the question presented in defendants' motion was in the interests of judicial economy and raised an issue of public importance, that being an alleged injury to a nonviable fetus, because defendants offered no evidence of any potential injury to either party if the issue was presented after a final judgment on the merits.

        Court of appeals addressed the interlocutory appeals from the denials of motions to dismiss filed by physicians employed by the Department of Public Safety because orders denying dispositive motions based on public official's immunity affected a substantial right and were immediately appealable; the physicians' appeals were interlocutory because the trial court's denial of their motions to dismiss did not dispose of the case.

        Because employees failed to satisfy their burden as to all but their lack of personal jurisdiction argument, their appeal of the denial of their motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a clam upon which relief could be granted and estoppel motions was subject to dismissal; the statement of the grounds for appellate review only argued that the trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction affected a substantial right.

        Immunity as Basis for Summary Adjudication.
   
   - Denial of a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment is interlocutory and not immediately appealable. However, recent case law clearly establishes that if immunity is raised as a basis in the motion for summary adjudication, a substantial right is affected and the denial is immediately appealable.

        Following dismissal of their previous appeal, defendants filed an answer in which they specifically asserted collateral estoppel as a defense to plaintiffs' malicious prosecution claims and moved for judgment on the pleadings based upon their collateral estoppel defense; defendants having made a colorable assertion that the claim is barred under collateral estoppel, the denial of their motion for judgment on the pleadings affected a substantial right and their interlocutory appeal was properly before the court.

        Order Regarding Counterclaims.
   
   - The trial court's order for partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff employee suing for payment of a commission as to the defendant employer's four counterclaims - wrongful attachment, negligence, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty - was interlocutory; no overlapping factual issues existed between the plaintiff's complaint and the defendant's counterclaims, and the order appealed from did not deprive the defendant of a substantial right which would be jeopardized absent a review prior to a final determination on the merits.

   - In an action arising out of a contract between the parties whereby defendants agreed to construct a house on a piece of property owned by them and to convey the completed house and property to plaintiffs, the trial court's order dismissing defendants' counterclaims for overages, interest expenses, liquidated damages, attorneys' fees and trespass but allowing defendants to assert these counterclaims as set-offs to plaintiff's claim was not a final judgment; however, the judgment in question affected a substantial right of defendants, their right to recover on their claims based on the contract, and the absence of an immediate appeal would work an injury to them, the possibility of being forced to undergo two full trials on the merits and to incur the expense of litigating twice, if not corrected before an appeal from a final judgment.

        Order Granting Summary Judgment.
   
   - An order granting summary judgment denied plaintiff a jury trial on the issue of its claim against the bank and, in effect, determined the claim in favor of the bank. Thus the order affected a substantial right and was appealable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> and this section.

       <p>
        In an action seeking to quiet title to property which plaintiffs, the original owners, alleged was secured by two of the three defendants by fraud or by mutual mistake and conveyed by general warranty deed to the other defendant, the current owner, summary judgment in favor of the current owner precluded plaintiffs from obtaining reformation of the deed and reconveyance of the property, thereby affecting a substantial right, and therefore the interlocutory order was appealable. Jenkins v. Maintenance, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 332 S.E.2d 90 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by a discharged employee seeking to recover accumulated vacation leave, a "substantial right" of the plaintiff was affected by the granting of summary judgment for the defendant, so that the order granting the motion for summary judgment was appealable, despite the defendant's pending counterclaim for wrongful conversion of company funds, and despite the absence of a determination by the trial judge under N.C.R.C.P., Rule 54(b), that "there was no just reason for delay." Narron v. Hardee's Food Sys., <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 331 S.E.2d 205, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 542</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 316 (1985).

        Where summary judgment is allowed for fewer than all the defendants and the judgment does not contain a certification pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 54(b), that there is "no just reason for delay," an appeal is premature unless the order allowing summary judgment affects a substantial right.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the possibility of an inconsistent verdict in defendants' counterclaim trial could irreparably prejudice any subsequent trial of plaintiff's negligence and contract claims, the trial court's summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's claims affected a substantial right such that it was immediately appealable under subdivision (d)(1) of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277(a)</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Where defendants' defense to plaintiff's promissory note claim, as well as their counterclaims, were both founded on proving plaintiff's breach of a fiduciary relationship with defendants, defendants' substantial right to avoid separate trials of the same issue would be prejudiced absent immediate review of the trial court's grant of summary judgment on plaintiff's claim. Whitehurst v. Corey, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 746, 364 S.E.2d 728 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment on complaint was not appealable before counterclaim for attorneys' fees had been adjudicated by the trial court. There was no possibility of inconsistent results in complaint and counterclaim because an award for counterclaim could only have been granted if defendants were prevailing parties in the plaintiff 's action; therefore, as parties did not address any other substantial right which could have been affected, no substantial right was involved which would have been "lost, prejudiced, or less than adequately protected" if court did not review appeal before final judgment.

       </p>
       <p>
        Since plaintiff's claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, on which defendant was granted summary judgment, involved the issue of defendant's negligence as well as the separate factual issues of the existence of severe emotional distress and foreseeability of injury, if at trial a jury determined defendant's conduct to have been negligent, then plaintiff would only have to prove severe emotional distress and foreseeability of injury at a second trial in the event of a proper successful appeal of the summary judgment. Since a second trial would not require plaintiff to retry the negligence issue, there were no overlapping issues to justify an immediate appeal of the interlocutory order. Jarrell v. Coastal Emergency Servs. of Carolinas, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 464 S.E.2d 720 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        While an order granting summary judgment was interlocutory, it was appealable because the cause of action for criminal conversation, which was still before the trial court, was so connected with the claim for alienation of affections that only one issue of damages should be submitted to the jury, and thus, a substantial right was at stake to have the same jury hear the wife's two claims. McCutchen v. McCutchen, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 280</cite>, 624 S.E.2d 620 (2006).

       <p>
        When, in a personal injury case, a trial court granted summary judgment in favor of some of the parties sued, the judgment was appealable, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277(a)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(d)(1)</a></cite>, because it was alleged that the parties as to whom summary judgment was granted were joint tortfeasors with the remaining parties, so many of the same factual issues would apply to the claims against the parties awarded summary judgment and to the remaining parties, and separate trials could result in inconsistent judgments, so the alleged injured parties who brought suit asserted a substantial right to immediate review, and their appeals were properly before the appellate court.

        Seller's appeal of the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the buyer was dismissed because the order did not affect a substantial right and the case presented no possibility of inconsistent verdicts where, while it was undisputed that the parties were identical and that they litigated a prior federal action, there was not a final judgment on the merits in the prior action on the current claim of breach of fiduciary duty, the current claim was not a material and relevant matter within the scope of the pleadings of the federal suit, and the buyer sought a remedy for a separate and distinct negligent act leading to a separate and distinct injury.

        Order Denying Summary Judgment.
   
   - Because there was a question of fact as to whether defendants followed the applicable standard of care, they were not entitled to qualified immunity under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html#t122Ca05s122C-210.1" target="_blank">G.S. 122C-210.1</a></cite> on plaintiff's wrongful death claims as a matter of law; accordingly, the denial of their motion for summary judgment did not deprive them of a substantial right, and their appeal was dismissed as interlocutory. Snyder v. Learning Servs. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 480, 653 S.E.2d 548 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of husband's summary judgment motion opposing a wife's attempt to enforce a separation agreement amendment was immediately appealable because a ruling that the amendment was not void essentially struck the husband's defense and was, in substance, a demurrer affecting the husband's substantial right. Kelley v. Kelley, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 798 S.E.2d 771 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lender's appeal of an order denying its motion for summary judgment was properly before the court of appeals because absent immediate appeal, the lender would lose a substantial right; trial of the case could result in inconsistent judgments between the same parties involving the seizure of the same collateral. R.C. Koonts & Sons Masonry, Inc. v. First Nat'l Bank, - N.C. App.

       <p>
        Employer's appeal of a denial of its motion for summary judgment in a wrongful death suit was properly before the appellate court;
   
   the summary judgment motion argued that the employer was immune from the suit, and, although the appeal was interlocutory, appellate review was necessary on the grounds that the North Carolina's Workers' Compensation Act granted employers who complied with the Act immunity from suit, which would have been lost if the case was permitted to go to trial. This immunity from suit affected a substantial right. Edwards v. GE Lighting Sys., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 578, 668 S.E.2d 114 (2008).

       </p>
       <p>
        Interlocutory appeal of the denial of defendants' motion for summary judgment in a constructive trust action was allowed; the basis of the motion for summary judgment was that res judicata barred the constructive trust action and in such a case, the failure to allow an appeal might affect a substantial right in that the possibility existed that without an immediate appeal, they would be required to twice defend against the same claim by plaintiffs.

        Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment.
   
   - The trial court's entry of summary judgment for a monetary sum against one of two defendants affected a "substantial right" of that defendant, and such judgment was therefore immediately appealable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> and this section, notwithstanding the absence of an express determination by the trial judge that there was "no just reason for delay" as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 54(b).

       </p>
       <p>
        An order of partial summary judgment dismissing a punitive damages claim was appealable, though interlocutory, since claims for compensatory and punitive damages depended upon the same evidence and plaintiff 's right to try them before the same jury and avoid the possible travesty of different juries rendering conflicting verdicts was a substantial one. Nance v. Robertson, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 121, 370 S.E.2d 283, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 477</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 865 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court's summary judgment determined fewer than all claims between parties, plaintiff could maintain interlocutory appeals from court's judgment, since trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's negligence, fraud and unfair trade practice claims against defendant insurance company and unfair trade claim against defendant insurance agency affected substantial right since there were factual issues common to claims dismissed by trial court and negligence claim which it did not dismiss. Davidson v. Knauff Ins. Agency, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 376 S.E.2d 488, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 577</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 772 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff claimed that defendants, husband and wife, were negligent, and where summary judgment was granted in favor of wife, and where a possibility existed that inconsistent verdicts would be rendered in separate trials on the issue of husband and wife's joint and concurrent negligence if plaintiff 's appeal ultimately was successful, judgment was appealable because it affected a substantial right of plaintiff to have determined, in a single action, the question of whether plaintiff was injured by the acts of one, both, or neither of the defendants, especially since the claims against them arose from the same series of events. DeHaven v. Hoskins, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 382 S.E.2d 856 (1989), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 705</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 452 (1989), overruled on other grounds, Nelson v.

        The appellate court eliminated specifically the application of the doctrine of substantial rights to cases wherein partial summary judgment has been granted denying a claim for punitive damages. Moose v. Nissan of Statesville, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 423, 444 S.E.2d 694 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        There were no factual issues common to the claims determined by summary judgments or the claims remaining, so that no substantial right was affected and plaintiff was not entitled to interlocutory appeal of summary judgments, since plaintiff did not present identical factual issues creating the possibility of two trials on the same issue. Jarrell v. Coastal Emergency Servs. of Carolinas, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 464 S.E.2d 720 (1995).

        Plaintiffs argued the appeal was properly before the appellate court as an appeal from an interlocutory order affecting a substantial right, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(d)(1)</a></cite>; the trial court's grant of partial judgment to defendants was an interlocutory order because plaintiffs' claim for breach of contract remained pending and common to all claims - unjust enrichment, unfair and deceptive trade practices, common law fraud/breach of fiduciary duty, constructive trust, and punitive damages - was the factual issue of whether defendants caused plaintiffs' damages by falsely representing that a North Carolina limited liability corporation (LLC) validly existed as a LLC and by inducing plaintiffs to invest in the business. Because there were overlapping factual issues, inconsistent verdicts could result, thus, the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment to defendants affected a substantial right, and plaintiffs' appeal was properly before the appellate court.

       <p>
        Insurer could not appeal from an interlocutory order granting summary judgment in favor of the insured as to the insurer's defense of champerty and maintenance because the insured's action was brought after its litigation with a homeowner had concluded and thus, a determination that the insurer did or did not owe a duty to defend the insured did not affect a substantial right because it would not change the resolution of the prior case. Paradigm Consultants, Ltd. v. Builders Mut. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 314, 745 S.E.2d 69 (2013).

Kirby v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 345, 769 S.E.2d 218, dismissed and review granted, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 279</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 829, 2015 N.C. LEXIS 704 (2015).

        Same - Where Injunction Is Part of Order.
   
   - While ordinarily, the allowance of a motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability, reserving for trial the issue of damages, will not be appealable, where a mandatory injunction was part of the order for partial summary judgment, it clearly affected a "substantial right" of the defendant and the allowance of the motion for partial summary judgment was appealable. English v. Holden Beach Realty Corp., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C.

        Order Requiring Jury Trial.
   
   - If an order denying a jury trial is appealable, an order requiring a jury trial should be appealable. If denial of a jury trial affects a substantial right, which would be lost absent review prior to final determination, the requirement that a case will be tried by a jury should have the same effect.

       <p>
        Generally, the right to avoid a trial is not a substantial right; however, while avoidance of two trials on the same issues may be. This would require that a party show that the same factual issues would be present in both trials and that the possibility of inconsistent verdicts on those issues exists. Stafford v.

        Appellate court could hear landowners' appeal of an order determining a boundary line because the order prejudiced the landowners' substantial rights by (1) effectively mooting the landowners' claims, and (2) denying the landowners' right to a jury trial on the factual issue of the boundary line's "on the ground" location.

        Court of appeals had jurisdiction to review the merits of a subsidiary's appeal of an order denying its motion to stay distributors' claims pending arbitration; the right to arbitrate a claim or issue is a substantial right if it was enforceable by or against an appellant who is a non-signatory to the agreement creating it.

        Court of appeals considered the merits of a manufacturer's appeal because the manufacturer met its burden to demonstrate that it had jurisdiction over its appeal of an order denying its right to arbitrate; the order affected the manufacturer's substantial right to arbitrate because the effect of the order was to require the manufacturer to proceed in defending distributor's claims against it in court rather than in arbitration.

       <p>
        In an employment dispute, an appellate court had jurisdiction because an order enjoined certain claims from proceeding to arbitration, and a substantial right existed that could have been lost absent immediate appellate review. Epic Games, Inc. v. Murphy-Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 54, 785 S.E.2d 137 (2016).

        Orders Regarding Condemnation Proceedings.

App.</cite> 456, 172 S.E.2d 915 (1970) and other prior decisions recognizing a right of immediate appeal from orders and awards pendente lite are overruled. Thus, where husband in a divorce action appealed an order by the trial court for alimony pendente lite, child support pendente lite, and attorneys' fees pendente lite, the appeal was premature and therefore was dismissed. See Stephenson v. Stephenson, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 285 S.E.2d 281 (1981).

        Order which clearly affected the right of plaintiff to receive support
   
   on behalf of minor children from defendant on a monthly basis as needed and in the amount which had been found reasonably necessary for the support and maintenance of the children involved a substantial right, and therefore the order in question was immediately appealable. Appert v. Appert, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 27, 341 S.E.2d 342 (1986).

        Denial of Attorneys' Motion for Admission Pro Hac Vice.
   
   - Order denying plaintiff's motion to reconsider order denying attorneys' motion for admission pro hac vice was an interlocutory order and was not immediately appealable; it did not come within the statutory appeals in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277(a)</a></cite> or subsection (d) of this section.

        Preliminary Injunction Against Operation of Business.
   
   - Defendant could appeal trial court's issuance of a preliminary injunction enjoining defendant from operating a used car lot in violation of plaintiff town's zoning ordinance, where although defendant's appeal was from an interlocutory order, defendant would have been deprived of a substantial right, the right to operate his business, absent a review prior to determination on the merits.

       <p>
        Denial of Preliminary Injunction
   
   - Court of appeals found that deciding if operating video games in arcade was a substantial right was not necessary where a trial court's denial of a preliminary injunction did not strip the operators of a substantial right and the operators' appeal was interlocutory. Bessemer City Express, Inc. v. City of Kings Mt., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 573 S.E.2d 712 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 61</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 384 (2003).

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's order granting a preliminary injunction restraining the sale of real property was immediately appealable;
   
   the merits of the underlying special proceeding between an executor and a widow in which the executor's right to partition property and to sell the widow's interest therein were decided by the entry of the widow's default nearly 10 years before, and there could have been no final order confirming a sale of the widow's allotted portion of the farm until a sale, which the trial court's order enjoined, was accomplished.

        Noncompetition Agreement.
   
   - Interlocutory holdings that an employer's voluntary dismissal was in bad faith and the employer's noncompetition agreement was invalid were reviewed because, based on judicial economy, it was appropriate to exercise discretion to treat the employer's appeal as a certiorari petition. Mkt. Am., Inc. v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 98, 809 S.E.2d 32 (2017).

       <p>
        Preliminary Injunction Pursuant to Covenant Not to Compete.
   
   - Preliminary injunction entered by the trial court against defendant, pursuant to a covenant not to compete, was appealable prior to final determination on the merits, as it deprived defendant of a substantial right which he would lose absent review prior to a final determination. Masterclean of N.C. Inc. v. Guy, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 45, 345 S.E.2d 692 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for injunctive relief and damages based on alleged breach of a covenant not to compete, defendant's appeal of trial court's preliminary injunction barring him from participating in any employment that competed with plaintiff's business in certain geographic locations would be dismissed as interlocutory, where there was no evidence in the record to show that defendant was presently working in any of those areas, as the injunction did not deprive defendant of any substantial right which he would lose absent a review prior to final determination. Automated Data Sys. v. Myers, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 624, 386 S.E.2d 432 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a former employer sued a former employee for violating a covenant not to compete, the employee was entitled to interlocutory review of the trial court's decision to issue a preliminary injunction which, inter alia, prohibited the employee from working for the employer's competitors in North Carolina or South Carolina, as the injunction adversely affected the employee's substantial right to earn a living and to practice the employee's livelihood. Precision Walls, Inc. v. Servie, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 568 S.E.2d 267 (2002).

        Attorney-Client Privilege.
   
   - The trial court's orders requiring that the defendants-insurers produce material protected by the attorney-client privilege affected a substantial right and entitled them to a hearing on appeal.

        An order that denied a motion to invalidate appellee's request for a jury trial

       </p>
       <p>
        Where superior court's refusal to invalidate plaintiffs' demand for a jury trial in a stockholder's derivative action amounted to a ruling that plaintiffs were entitled to a jury trial, denial of defendants' motion to invalidate the demand was appealable.

        Dismissal of Claim Against One Defendant.
   
   - Dismissal of Count II of plaintiff's amended complaint, resulting in dismissal of plaintiff's claim against defendant professional corporation, affected her substantial right to have determined in a single proceeding the issues of whether she had been damaged by the actions of one, some or all of the defendants, especially since her claims against all of them arose upon the same series of transactions. Therefore, her appeal therefrom was not premature. Fox v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 292, 354 S.E.2d 737 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Injured party's appeal from the trial court's judgment dismissing the injured party's claims against a church and a landowner was interlocutory because the trial court did not dismiss the injured party's claims against the landowner's son; however, the judgment was appealable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> and subsection (d) of this section because the injured party had a substantial right in having the case against all defendants tried by the same jury.

       <p>
        The trial court's dismissal of all claims against defendant/insurer and some but not all claims against defendant-landlords
   
   affected a substantial right where plaintiff sought relief against them based on negligence, violation of the statutory duty of a landlord to repair premises, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and wrongful death, all arising from the single occurrence of a fire in a rental home and where she had the right to have all her claims adjudicated in a single proceeding.

   - Order from which defendant first appealed, which contained no enforcement sanctions, and only ordered defendant to answer questions by a certain date, was not properly appealable, and its attempted appeal was a nullity, notwithstanding the fact that the judge signed the appeal entries. Accordingly, such appeal did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to subsequently enter sanctions against defendant. Benfield v. Benfield, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 366 S.E.2d 500 (1988).

       <p>
        Denial of the caveators' motion to compel the decedent's former attorney to answer deposition questions was an interlocutory order that was not appealable, because the order did not affect a substantial right pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277(a)</a></cite> and subdivision (d)(1) of this section; the caveators failed to demonstrate that the attorney, who was discharged prior to the drafting of the will at issue in the case, possessed relevant information concerning the decedent's health or relationship with the propounder of the will at the time the will was drafted.

        When defendants contended that nursing home incident reports were protected by the peer review privilege, the trial court's interlocutory order compelling production of the reports affected a substantial right and thus was immediately appealable.

        Interlocutory order was immediately appealable under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(d)(1)</a></cite> because the order affected a substantial right as the trial court's order compelled the production of a letter from a neuro-surgeon, who treated the decedent, to the chairperson of a hospital's surgical peer review committee and the letter might have been statutorily privileged from disclosure under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131E.html#t131Ea05s131E-95" target="_blank">G.S. 131E-95</a></cite>.

        When a homeowners' association sued a manufacturer for product liability under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.099B.html#t99Bs99B-1" target="_blank">G.S. 99B-1</a></cite> et seq., and a trial court ordered the association to return documents to the manufacturer that were inadvertently released to the association in discovery, the association could not immediately appeal the order under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> or <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(d)(1)</a></cite> on the theory that the order affected the association's substantial right, because: (1) the association did not identify a right that was affected or show how such a right would be jeopardized without immediate review; (2) unsupported opinions in a memo the association was ordered to return to the manufacturer did not affect a substantial right, as the memo did not show what the manufacturer's employees, outside testers and experts, knew about the product's adequacy and when the employees knew the information, and such prior knowledge was not critical to claims against the manufacturer; and (3), if such knowledge were critical, the memo did not contribute significantly to a determination of the issue.

       <p>
        County could not appeal an interlocutory order requiring a former manager to appear for a deposition because the county was not deprived of a substantial right nor did the county suffer injury warranting immediate review, as the order did not bar good-faith objections to the disclosure of privileged information at the deposition.

       <p>
        Expert witness could not appeal an order allowing the witness's deposition because (1) the order was interlocutory, (2) the witness did not allege a substantial right that would be jeopardized absent immediate appeal, and (3) the witness's that the witness's rights might be implicated if certain fact scenarios occurred in the future did not present a ripe controversy.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the limited discovery requested by a plaintiff is highly material to a determination of the critical issue in his motion to vacate, the order denying discovery affects a substantial right justifying immediate appeal under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1b3a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(b)(3)(a)</a></cite>.

        Sanctions for Noncompliance with Discovery Order.
   
   - Where a party is adjudged to be in contempt for noncompliance with a discovery order or has been assessed with certain other sanctions, the order is immediately appealable, since it affects a substantial right under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277</a></cite> and subdivision (d)(1) of this section.

        Order holding defendant in contempt of court for his failure to comply with discovery order was appealable and tested the validity both of the original discovery order and the contempt order. Benfield v. Benfield, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 366 S.E.2d 500 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of movant's motion to dismiss appeal was appropriate because the trial court ordered the nonmoving party on a motion to compel discovery to immediately pay attorneys fees as sanctions to the movant. Thus, the nonmoving party sufficiently established that the order for sanctions affected a substantial right and that interlocutory review was appropriate. Porters Neck Ltd., LLC v. Porters Neck Country Club, Inc., - N.C. App.

       </p>
       <p>
        Order Setting Aside Judgment.
   
   - The avoidance of having to affirmatively prove claim was not a "substantial" right, where plaintiff was affected by inability to immediately appeal order setting aside judgment only to the extent that it would have to establish defendants' liability and the amount thereof by proper evidence, rather than by relying upon a purported confession of judgment. First Am. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Satterfield, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 359 S.E.2d 812 (1987).

        Order setting aside a default judgment
   
   is interlocutory, as it does not finally dispose of the case and requires further action by the trial court. Horne v. Nobility Homes, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 363 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
   <br />

       <p>
        Order Denying Motion for Stay.
   
   - The denial of defendant's motion for stay did not dispose of any of the claims or parties, the trial court did not certify the case for immediate appeal under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 54(b), and defendants did not show that the trial court's decision deprived them of a substantial right which would be lost absent immediate review.

       <p>
        Order Requiring Posting of Bond.
   
   - Where brothers were equal shareholders in company, and company could no longer be conducted to the advantage of both of the shareholders, and where judge ordered the brothers to post a secured bond to ensure compliance with any judgment rendered, the appeal of the order by one of the brothers was interlocutory and would be dismissed; no substantial right of his was affected, since the amount of the bond reasonably approximated the value of the assets in his possession, and the bond would be cancelled if the opposing brother was unsuccessful in obtaining judgment in his favor. Stancil v. Stancil, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 760, 381 S.E.2d 720 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Order Increasing Attachment Bond Where No Findings Were Made.
   
   - Because the trial court was not required to make findings of fact in order to modify the plaintiffs' attachment bond on the motion of the defendant pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sXIIIa35s1-440.40ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-440.40(a)</a></cite>, and where the plaintiffs failed to request such findings, they could not assert that the order had affected their substantial rights and they were not entitled to review.

       <p>
        Order Removing Attorney.
   
   - Plaintiff had a substantial right to have attorney of her choice, properly admitted pro hac vice under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.084.html#t84a01s84-4.1" target="_blank">G.S. 84-4.1</a></cite>, represent her in her lawsuit, and order removing him as counsel affected a substantial right of the plaintiff and was immediately appealable.

       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court had jurisdiction to hear a law firm's interlocutory appeal from an order disqualifying the firm's attorneys from representing the firm in a fee collection case while also testifying for the firm because the order affected a substantial right.

       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion to Disqualify Counsel.
   
   - An order granting disqualification of counsel seriously disrupts the progress of litigation while new counsel is obtained, but one refusing such relief merely allows the action to proceed and has no permanent effect of any kind.

       <p>
        Ruling striking attorney's charging lien
   
   was not a final order, since a charging lien is not available until there is a final judgment or decree to which the lien can attach, and no final judgment had yet been entered in the underlying divorce action. Howell v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 365 S.E.2d 181 (1988).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court's entry of summary judgment against plaintiff included an award of attorneys' fees,
   
   it affected a substantial right; consequently, the order was immediately appealable pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277(a)</a></cite> and subsection (d) of this section.

       <p>
        Denial of attorneys' fees under G.S.
   
   50-16.4 was not a final order of the trial court, where at the time appellant's motion was filed there had been no determination that his client, defendant, was entitled to alimony pendente lite under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-16.3" target="_blank">G.S. 50-16.3</a></cite>, so that appellant was not yet entitled to attorneys' fees under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-16.4" target="_blank">G.S. 50-16.4</a></cite>, and as appellant could appeal the denial of his motion after final judgment, or could bring a separate lawsuit to collect fees, no substantial right of appellant was affected by the Court of Appeals' failure to entertain an interlocutory appeal on this issue.

       <p>
        Alimony Award Held Interlocutory Because Motion for Attorney's Fees Still Unresolved.
   
   - Judgment awarding a wife permanent alimony was nonappealable because, inasmuch as the wife's claim for attorney's fees had not been disposed of by the trial court, the order was interlocutory, the order had not been certified by the trial court pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C.

       <p>
        Orders awarding child support, alimony, and attorneys' fees pendente lite
   
   are interlocutory decrees which necessarily do not affect a substantial right from which lies an immediate appeal pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(d)</a></cite>.

        Child support order which was not expressly designated pendente lite by the court, but which was nevertheless a temporary one,
   
   entered provisionally pending a final determination to be made at a later date, was not subject to review by appeal. Berry v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 624, 361 S.E.2d 771 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal of Temporary Custody Order.
   
   - As a trial court awarded a former husband temporary custody of the parties' child and the former wife made no showing that the order adversely affected a substantial right which could not be protected by a timely appeal of the trial court's ultimate disposition of the entire controversy on the merits, review of the interlocutory order was not warranted under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277(a)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(d)(1)</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Termination of Temporary Alimony.
   
   - Appeal of an order terminating dependent spouse's right to receive temporary alimony was not premature, as the question of plaintiff's continued entitlement to the previously ordered alimony pendente lite until such time as her prayer for permanent alimony could be heard affected a "substantial right" of the dependent spouse. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 355 S.E.2d 525, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 511</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 516 (1987).

        Equitable Distribution Order.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Order Barring Defendant from Equitable Distribution.
   
   - Trial court's order denying defendant's motion to amend his answer in divorce action, which he filed following grant of absolute divorce to plaintiff, had the effect of forever barring defendant from asserting a claim for equitable distribution, and thus affected a substantial right; it was therefore appealable as a matter of right. Goodwin v. Zeydel, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 387 S.E.2d 57 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Order Dismissing Equitable Distribution Claim.
   
   - Given the factual issues overlapping husband's company's contract claim retained by the court and wife's equitable distribution counterclaim which it dismissed, wife could appeal the dismissal of the equitable distribution counterclaim as a matter of right, since a substantial right would otherwise be affected. Small v. Small, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 614, 379 S.E.2d 273, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 273</cite>, 384 S.E.2d 519 (1989).

       <p>
        Order Granting Absolute Divorce While Reserving Equitable Distribution Issues.
   
   - While the trial court's determination of the parties' date of separation might have an effect on the unresolved issue of equitable distribution, the same factual issues would not be involved and no threat of inconsistent verdicts was involved, and thus, no substantial right of the husband was affected so as to entitle him to appeal the trial court's grant of an absolute divorce to the wife while reserving equitable distribution issues for a later hearing. Stafford v. Stafford, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 163, 515 S.E.2d 43 (1999), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 94</cite>, 520 S.E.2d 785 (1999).

       <p>
        Ruling Disposing of a Plea in Bar.
   
   - Court's ruling on a separation/property settlement agreement did not dispose of plaintiff's claims for equitable distribution and alimony but only disposed of defendant's plea in bar to those claims: The court's ruling was thus interlocutory, and although the court's order stated that its ruling affected a substantial right and was a proper subject of immediate appeal, the court's order could not be certified as a final appealable order under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 54(b).

        Appeal of Order Denying Motion to Disqualify Opponent's Counsel.
   
   - Where defendant maintained that because law firm representing plaintiff represented defendant in previous matters of a similar nature (but not involving plaintiff), that firm could not represent plaintiff in the present matter, it did have a substantial right to prevent prior counsel from using confidential information gleaned from a prior representation and utilizing it against the client in subsequent litigation, however, it cannot be found that the deprivation of this right would injure defendant if not corrected before a final judgment, and defendant's appeal of the trial court's order denying its motion to disqualify law firm was interlocutory.

        Judgment That Leaves Issue of Damages Unresolved.
   
   - A judgment that determines only that there has in fact been a breach by defendant and leaves unresolved the issue of plaintiffs' damage is clearly an interlocutory order; an order determining only the issue of liability and leaving unresolved other issues such as that of damages cannot be held to affect a substantial right.

   - Appeal from the North Carolina Industrial Commission's order that a deputy commissioner's dismissal of a workers' compensation claim was to be deemed to be without prejudice was dismissed; the Commission's order was an interlocutory order, from which there was no general right to immediate review, and the denial of immediate review would not affect the employers' substantial rights.

        Interlocutory Appeal From Denial of Appointment of Receiver.
   
   - Shareholders were entitled to an interlocutory appeal of the trial court's denial of their motion for the appointment of a receiver because they established a substantial right to the preservation of what they alleged were their corporation's assets and opportunities under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277(a)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-27ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-27(d)(1)</a></cite>, which right was substantially affected by the trial court's denial of the appointment of a receiver. Barnes v. Kochhar, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 633 S.E.2d 474 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's denial of a motion to enforce a settlement did not resolve the underlying personal injury claim, and the order of denial was therefore interlocutory;
   
   since the trial court did not certify that there was no just reason to delay the appeal, and the denial did not affect a substantial right, there was no right to an immediate appeal since an appeal of the denial was still allowed once there was a final judgment. Milton v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 176, 611 S.E.2d 474 (2005).

       Appeal By State Bar of North Carolina
   
   - Court of Appeals of North Carolina lacked jurisdiction to hear the State Bar of North Carolina's appeal of a grant of summary judgment to an attorney in a disciplinary proceeding because <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.084.html#t84a04s84-28ol1h" target="_blank">G.S. 84-28(h)</a></cite> provided no appeal from a final order that did not impose discipline and in the instant case no discipline had been imposed. N.C. State Bar v. Rudisill, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 704, 583 S.E.2d 413 (2003).

       An order of the hearing commission of the State Bar denying defendant's motion to dismiss
   
   on the ground of lack of jurisdiction is interlocutory; therefore, defendant cannot appeal therefrom as a matter of right. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 564</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 280 (1979).

     <p>
      Except as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-28" target="_self">G.S. 7A-28</a></cite>, an appeal lies of right to the Supreme Court from any decision of the Court of Appeals rendered in a case:

       In which there is a dissent when the Court of Appeals is sitting in a panel of three judges. An appeal of right pursuant to this subdivision is not effective until after the Court of Appeals sitting en banc has rendered a decision in the case, if the Court of Appeals hears the case en banc, or until after the time for filing a motion for rehearing of the cause by the Court of Appeals has expired or the Court of Appeals has denied the motion for rehearing.

        Legislative Intent.
   
   - In establishing the North Carolina Court of Appeals, defining its jurisdiction, and providing a system of appeals, the General Assembly followed the basic principle that there should be only one trial on the merits and one appeal on the law, as of right, in every case. Consequently, double appeals as of right - first to the Court of Appeals and then to the Supreme Court - are authorized only in the instances specified by this section. State v. Cumber, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 127</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 141 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Had the General Assembly intended to limit double appeals in criminal cases to the defendant
   
   only, it would have said so. State v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 125</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 752 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Scope of Review.
   
   - When the Supreme Court, after a decision of a cause by the Court of Appeals and pursuant to the petition of a party thereto as authorized by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-31" target="_self">G.S. 7A-31</a></cite>, grants certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals, only the decision of the Court of Appeals is before the Supreme Court for review. The Supreme Court inquires into proceedings in the trial court solely to determine the correctness of the decision of the Court of Appeals. Its inquiry is restricted to rulings of the Court of Appeals which are assigned as error in the petition for certiorari and which are preserved by arguments or the citation of authorities with reference thereto in the brief filed by the petitioner in the Supreme Court, except in those instances in which the Supreme Court elects to exercise its general power of supervision of courts inferior to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court review of a decision by the Court of Appeals upon an appeal from it to the Supreme Court as a matter of right, pursuant to this section, is similarly limited. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 328</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 353 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the dissent in a decision of a divided panel of the Court of Appeals of North Carolina did not address a particular issue, defendant's arguments on that issue were not properly before the Supreme Court of North Carolina. State v. Barnard, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 244</cite>, 658 S.E.2d 643 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Counsel.
   
   - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-450" target="_self">G.S. 7A-450</a></cite> et seq. has generally been construed to limit the right to appointed counsel in criminal cases to direct appeals taken as of right. Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974).

         II. CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The constitutional question must be real and substantial
   
   rather than superficial and frivolous. It must be a constitutional question which has not already been the subject of conclusive judicial determination. State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 295</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 376 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1087, 89 S. Ct. 876, 21 L. Ed. 2d 780 (1969); Bundy v. Ayscue, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 81</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 1 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Dismissal Where Involvement of Substantial Constitutional Question Is Not Shown.
   
   - An appellant seeking a second review by the Supreme Court as a matter of right on the ground that a substantial constitutional question is involved must allege and show the involvement of such question or suffer dismissal. State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 295</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 376 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1087, 89 S. Ct. 876, 21 L. Ed. 2d 780 (1969); Bundy v. Ayscue, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 81</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 1 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires that an appellant must either allege and show the existence of a real and substantial constitutional question which has not already been the subject of conclusive judicial determination or suffer dismissal. Thompson v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 120</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 606 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondent's appeal based solely on the assertion that the district court's allowance of an amendment to a juvenile petition deprived him of a constitutional right was dismissed by the Supreme Court, ex mero motu, because it did not directly involve a substantial constitutional question within the meaning of this section. In re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 616</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 267 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mouthing of Constitutional Phrases Will Not Avoid Dismissal.
   
   - Mere mouthing of constitutional phrases like "due process of law" and "equal protection of the law" will not avoid dismissal. State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 295</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 376 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1087, 89 S. Ct. 876, 21 L. Ed. 2d 780 (1969); Bundy v. Ayscue, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 81</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 1 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Question Should Be Raised and Passed on in Trial Court.
   
   - Appellate courts will not ordinarily pass upon a constitutional question unless it affirmatively appears that such question was raised and passed upon in the trial court. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 404</cite>, 172 S.E.2d 527 (1970); State v. Cumber, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 127</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 141 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Preserved by Appropriate Objection, Assignment of Error and Argument in Brief.
   
   - The Supreme Court will not pass upon the merits of a litigant's contention that his constitutional right has been violated by a ruling or order of a lower court, unless, at the time the alleged violation of such right occurred or was threatened by a proposed procedure, ruling or offer of evidence, or at the earliest opportunity thereafter, the litigant made an appropriate objection, exception or motion and thereafter preserved the constitutional question at each level of appellate review by an appropriate assignment of error and by argument in his brief. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 404</cite>, 172 S.E.2d 527 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Consideration of Other Matters.
   
   - Once involvement of a substantial constitutional question is established, the Supreme Court will retain the case and may, in its discretion, pass upon any or all assignments of error, constitutional or otherwise, allegedly committed by the Court of Appeals and properly presented for review. State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 295</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 376 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1087, 89 S. Ct. 876, 21 L. Ed. 2d 780 (1969); Bundy v. Ayscue, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 81</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 1 (1969).

       <p>
        Legislative Intent.
   
   - The General Assembly intended to insure a review by the Supreme Court of questions on which there was a division in the intermediate appellate court; no such review was intended for claims joined or consolidated in the lower appellate court and on which that court rendered unanimous decision. Hendrix v. Alsop, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 549</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 802 (1971); State v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 125</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 752 (1972); State v.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Dissent Allows Appeal as a Matter of Right.
   
   - The aggrieved party, whether the State or the defendant, may appeal to the Supreme Court as of right from any decision of the Court of Appeals in which there is a dissent. State v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 125</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 752 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court of North Carolina found that it could hear an appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeals of North Carolina that a defendant be resentenced because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-30" target="_self">G.S. 7A-30(2)</a></cite> provided the state with an appeal of right as there was a dissent in the Court of Appeals. State v. Norris, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 507</cite>, 630 S.E.2d 915 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Concurring Opinions Labelled as Dissents.
   
   - Plaintiff had no right of appeal pursuant to subdivision (2) of this section, although two concurring opinions were labelled as dissents, where all three judges of the Court of Appeals agreed that the plaintiff's complaint and summonses should be dismissed, though for different reasons. Harris v. Maready, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 536</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 912 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Issues on Appeal Under Subdivision (2).
   
   - When an appeal is taken pursuant to subdivision (2) of this section, the only issues properly before the court are those on which the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals based his dissent. Clifford v. River Bend Plantation, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 460</cite>, 323 S.E.2d 23 (1984); State v. Hooper, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 680</cite>, 351 S.E.2d 286 (1987); Steingress v. Steingress, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 64</cite>, 511 S.E.2d 298 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal to the Supreme Court pursuant to subdivision (2) of this section by defendant from a decision of the Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, in which a majority of the panel found no error in defendant's convictions, where the dissenting judge disagreed only with the majority's treatment of the second question presented to that court, and where defendant did not petition the Supreme Court for discretionary review of the other questions, only the second question was properly before the Supreme Court for review, notwithstanding defendant's attempt to bring forward other questions in his brief. State v. Reilly, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 499</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 381 (1985), considering, however, the additional question of the sufficiency of the evidence in order to prevent manifest injustice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subdivision (2) of this section, only the issue raised in the dissent is properly before the Supreme Court for review. N.C.R.A.P., Rule 16 defines the permissible scope of review in such cases. Blumenthal v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 571</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 358 (1986), addressing, nevertheless, additional issues which arise frequently in the administration of estates, and must often be determined by the Department of Revenue under the Court's residual power or authority under N.C.R.A.P., Rule 2.

       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Failure to Serve Notice of Appeal.
   
   - Failure to serve the notice of appeal is a defect in the record analogous to failure to serve process. Therefore, a party upon whom service of notice of appeal is required may waive the failure of service by not raising the issue by motion or otherwise and by participating without objection in the appeal, and the Court of Appeals thus had jurisdiction and could consider the case on its merits. Hale v. Afro-American Arts Int'l, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 231</cite>, 436 S.E.2d 588 (1993).

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-31ol1a">
       In any cause in which appeal is taken to the Court of Appeals, including any cause heard while the Court of Appeals was sitting en banc, except a cause appealed from the North Carolina Industrial Commission, the North Carolina State Bar pursuant to G.S. 84-28, the Property Tax Commission pursuant to G.S. 105-345, the Board of State Contract Appeals pursuant to G.S. 143-135.9, the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. 58-2-80 or G.S. 58-65-131(c), a court-martial pursuant to G.S. 127A-62, a motion for appropriate relief, or valuation of exempt property pursuant to G.S. 7A-28, the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, on motion of any party to the cause or on its own motion, certify the cause for review by the Supreme Court, either before or after it has been determined by the Court of Appeals. A cause appealed to the Court of Appeals from any of the administrative bodies listed in the preceding sentence may be certified in similar fashion, but only after determination of the cause in the Court of Appeals. The effect of such certification is to transfer the cause from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court for review by the Supreme Court. If the cause is certified for transfer to the Supreme Court before its determination in the Court of Appeals, review is not had in the Court of Appeals but the cause is forthwith transferred for review in the first instance by the Supreme Court. If the cause is certified for transfer to the Supreme Court after its determination by the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court reviews the decision of the Court of Appeals.

      <p>
       Scope of Review.
   
   - When the Supreme Court, after a decision of a cause by the Court of Appeals and pursuant to the petition of a party thereto as authorized by this section, grants certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals, only the decision of the Court of Appeals is before the Supreme Court for review. The Supreme Court inquires into proceedings in the trial court solely to determine the correctness of the decision of the Court of Appeals. Its inquiry is restricted to rulings of the Court of Appeals which are assigned as error in the petition for certiorari and which are preserved by arguments or the citation of authorities with reference thereto in the brief filed by the petitioner in the Supreme Court, except in those instances in which the Supreme Court elects to exercise its general power of supervision of courts inferior to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court review of a decision by the Court of Appeals upon an appeal from it to the Supreme Court as a matter of right, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-30" target="_self">G.S. 7A-30</a></cite>, is similarly limited. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 328</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 353 (1968); Peaseley v. Virginia Iron, Coal &amp; Coke Co., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 585</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 133 (1973); State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 633</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 353 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court reviews the decision of the Court of Appeals for errors of law allegedly committed by it and properly brought forward for review. State v. Parrish, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 69</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 230 (1969); State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 633</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 353 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court may review the entire proceedings and consider any errors which have occurred during the course of the litigation, provided that the parties have taken the proper steps to preserve the questions for appellate review. Spartan Leasing, Inc. v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 689</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 649 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Supreme Court grants certiorari pursuant to this section, review is ordinarily restricted to the rulings of the Court of Appeals which are assigned as error in the petition for certiorari and brought forward in petitioner's brief. State v. Muse, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 31</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 214 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 974, 92 S. Ct. 2409, 32 L. Ed. 2d 674, rehearing denied, 409 U.S. 898, 93 S. Ct. 99, 34 L. Ed. 2d 157 (1972); Peaseley v. Virginia Iron, Coal &amp; Coke Co., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 585</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 133 (1973).

       Jurisdiction Proper.
   
   - Statute could not have restricted the Supreme Court of North Carolina's constitutional authority under N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   12(1) to exercise jurisdiction to review upon appeal any decision of the courts below, and as such, the Supreme Court of North Carolina did not hesitate to exercise its rarely used general supervisory authority when necessary to promote the expeditious administration of justice, and did so to consider questions that were not properly presented according to its rules; this exercise of supervisory authority was particularly appropriate when prompt and definitive resolution of an issue was necessary to ensure the uniform administration of North Carolina's criminal statutes. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 200</cite>, 639 S.E.2d 425 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Departure from General Rule.
   
   - In a criminal case in which the State petitioned for certiorari and the Court of Appeals ruled on only one of defendant's assignments of error in granting a new trial, the Supreme Court elected to depart from the general rule that review under this section is ordinarily restricted to the rulings of the Court of Appeals which are assigned as error, and to consider the remaining assignments of error not considered by the Court of Appeals. State v. Muse, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 31</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 214 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 974, 92 S. Ct. 2409, 32 L. Ed. 2d 674, rehearing denied, 409 U.S. 898, 93 S. Ct. 99, 34 L. Ed. 2d 157 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Improvidently Allowed.
   
   - Discretionary review, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-31" target="_self">G.S. 7A-31</a></cite>, of three protective orders was improvidently allowed; under N.C. R. App. P. 15(b), a husband's petition for review of those orders was not timely filed. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 518</cite>, 631 S.E.2d 114 (2006).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section the Supreme Court is to review only those cases of substantial general or legal importance
   
   or in which review is necessary to preserve the integrity of precedent established by the Supreme Court. Peaseley v. Virginia Iron, Coal &amp; Coke Co., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 585</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 133 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Constitutional Questions.
   
   - The Supreme Court will not ordinarily pass upon a constitutional question unless it affirmatively appears that such question was timely raised and passed upon in the trial court if it could have been, or in the Court of Appeals if the question arose after trial. State v. Parrish, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 69</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 230 (1969).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers' Compensation.
   
   - North Carolina Industrial Commission did not err in failing to prove a 10 percent late penalty because the employer's payment was not untimely; the time for appeal expired fifteen days after the mandate issued, the time to file for a petition for discretionary review ended and the employer avoided the penalty by making payment fourteen days after payment became due. Silva v. Lowes Home Improvement, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 175, 768 S.E.2d 180 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Appeal by application" such as a petition for discretionary review would be considered an appeal pursuant to subsection (e); because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-31" target="_self">G.S. 7A-31</a></cite> provides for discretionary review from the Industrial Commission and states that this review is an "appeal," "appeal" under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.097.html#t97a01s97-18ol1e" target="_blank">G.S. 97-18(e)</a></cite> includes the period during which a party may seek discretionary review by the supreme court of an opinion from the court of appeals. Silva v. Lowes Home Improvement, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 175, 768 S.E.2d 180 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of plaintiff to petition for a writ of certiorari to review the interlocutory decree
   
   of the Court of Appeals does not preclude the Supreme Court from granting certiorari after final judgment and thereupon considering and rectifying any errors which occurred at any stage of the proceedings. Spartan Leasing, Inc. v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 689</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 649 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits
   
   of the case and such denial does not mean that the Supreme Court has determined that the decision of the Court of Appeals is correct. Denial may simply mean that in the opinion of the Supreme Court the case does not require further review under the provisions of this section. Peaseley v. Virginia Iron, Coal &amp; Coke Co., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 585</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 133 (1973).

       <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-451" target="_self">G.S. 7A-451</a></cite> Does Not Give Indigent Right to Counsel.
   
   - An indigent is entitled to have a lawyer at his trial, and for direct review of that trial, but <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-451" target="_self">G.S. 7A-451</a></cite> is not intended to cover the discretionary power of the North Carolina Supreme Court to grant a writ of certiorari under this section. Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974).

       <b>
        And Equal Protection Clause Does Not Require Free Counsel for Discretionary Appeals.
       </b>
       - The equal protection clause does not require North Carolina to provide free counsel for indigent defendants seeking to take discretionary appeals to the North Carolina Supreme Court or to file petitions for certiorari to that court. Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The duty of the State is not to duplicate the legal arsenal that may be privately retained by a criminal defendant in a continuing effort to reverse his conviction, but only to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State's appellate process. Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A defendant is not denied meaningful access
       </b>
       to the North Carolina Supreme Court simply because the State does not appoint counsel to aid him in seeking discretionary review in that court. At that stage he will have a transcript or other record of trial proceedings, a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and often an opinion by the Court of Appeals disposing of his case. These materials, supplemented by whatever submission respondent may make pro se, would appear to provide the Supreme Court with an adequate basis on which to base its decision to grant or deny review. Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Equally Divided Court.
   
   - Where one member of the Supreme Court does not participate in the consideration or decision of a case, and the remaining six justices are equally divided as to whether the decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed or reversed, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed without becoming a precedent. Greenhill v. Crabtree, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 520</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 908 (1980); Wayfaring Home, Inc. v. Ward, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 518</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 121 (1980).

       </b>
       - The fact that the respondent in an appeal from the order of a United States magistrate dismissing a claim for habeas corpus relief incorrectly pleaded that the appellant had exhausted his state court remedies and was entitled to adjudication on the merits was neither conclusive nor a waiver of the exhaustion requirement by the State. Strader v. Allsbrook, 656 F.2d 67 (4th Cir. 1981).

        <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-31.1ol1b1">
         The subject matter of the appeal has significant public interest, or

        </li>
        <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-31.1ol1b3">
         The decision of the Wake County Superior Court appears likely to be in conflict with a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-31.1ol1c">

     </ol>
     <p>
      Interlocutory determinations by the Wake County Superior Court, including orders remanding the cause for a new trial or for other proceedings, shall be certified for review by the Court of Appeals only upon a determination by the Court of Appeals that failure to certify would cause a delay in final adjudication which would probably result in substantial harm.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Court of Appeals is authorized to treat an appeal as a petition for a writ of certiorari
   
   in order to clarify its position. Jerson v. Jerson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 738, 315 S.E.2d 522 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court could exercise its discretion to treat pro se defendant's appeal as a petition for certiorari and grant the writ to address the merits of defendant's appeal for speeding and failure to produce a driver's license where defendant failed to include in the record on appeal a copy of the district court judgment establishing the derivative jurisdiction of the superior court. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 310, 560 S.E.2d 852, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 499</cite>, 564 S.E.2d 230 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the court of appeals did not state the procedure for review, the trial court did not enter an appealable order, and defendant did not seek entry of such an order by mandamus, defendant was not entitled to appeal as a matter of right; however, defendant petitioned for review by certiorari, and the court of appeals granted his petition for writ of certiorari in its discretion. State v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 725, 783 S.E.2d 279 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals elected to treat defendant's appeal as a petition for certiorari because, while the district court's judgment and the notice of appeal to the superior court therefrom were not included in the record on appeal, a district court proceeding was in fact alluded to in the record; the district court's order indicated that defendant was found guilty of driving while impaired (DWI), although the DWI judgment was not attached or included in the record; and the State did not dispute that the superior court had jurisdiction. State v. McNeil, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 822 S.E.2d 317 (2018), review dismissed, State v. Myers-McNeil, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 718</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 88, 2019 N.C.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal Treated As Petition for Certiorari.
   
   - Defendant's notice was deficient and defendant failed to properly preserve the right to appeal because, although defendant timely filed written notice of appeal, the notice attempted to appeal the trial court's order denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence instead of the judgment underlying defendant's convictions. Nonetheless, the appellate court treated defendant's appeal as a petition for certiorari and granted the writ to address the merits of the appeal. State v. Horton, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 711, 826 S.E.2d 770 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant did not follow the correct procedure for appealing the entry of a civil judgment ordering defendant to pay attorney's fees, the appellate court granted defendant's petition for writ of certiorari, and thereby obtained jurisdiction to consider the merits of defendant's appeal even if defendant's right to appeal the judgment was lost by failure to take timely action. State v. Mangum, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 862 (2020).

        Appeal Dismissed But Arguments Reviewed.
       </b>
       - Record on appeal lacked copies of the juvenile petitions purportedly filed and, thus, the record failed to demonstrate the trial court's jurisdiction over the subject matter; because the record was silent with regard to the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction, the respondents' appeal was dismissed, but pursuant to the court's discretionary authority, the court elected to review their arguments on appeal by writ of certiorari. In re J.C.M.J.C., - N.C. App.
   - , 834 S.E.2d 670 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Guilty Plea.
   
   - Defendant's appeal asserting a guilty plea was not the product of an informed choice when a plea agreement's terms were contradictory was dismissed because (1) defendant had no statutory right to appeal the issue, (2) the issue was not listed in N.C. R. App. P. 21(a)(1) as one eligible for review pursuant to a writ of certiorari, nor (3) was it appropriate to invoke N.C. R. App. P. 2 to suspend the requirements of N.C. R. App. P. 21, as defendant showed no "exceptional circumstances," since defendant received a sentence consistent with defendant's guilty plea, acknowledgement of an aggravating factor, and understanding the sentence rested within the trial court's discretion. State v. Biddix, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 780 S.E.2d 863 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court could grant defendant review by a writ of certiorari after pleading guilty because, while defendant's appeal raised no issue for which an appeal of right was afforded, (1) N.C. Const. art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   12(2) let the General Assembly prescribe the court's jurisdiction, (2) <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-32ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7A-32(c)</a></cite> gave the court broad powers to control trial court proceedings, (3) <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa91s15A-1444ol1e" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1444(e)</a></cite> had no limiting language, and (4) N.C. R. App. P. 21 could not limit defendant's statutory right to seek the writ. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 789, 802 S.E.2d 518 (2017).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the State cannot appeal from a verdict of not guilty, it may seek a writ of mandamus
   
   to compel a trial court to set aside action taken in excess of its authority. State v. Surles, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 284 S.E.2d 738 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 307</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 707 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The State's attempted appeal of a district court's action in setting aside guilty verdicts in a misdemeanor case entered by it five months previously and entering verdicts of not guilty would be treated as a petition for a writ of mandamus pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and N.C.R.A.P., Rule 22. State v. Surles, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 284 S.E.2d 738 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 307</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 707 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Writ of Certiorari Lawfully Issued.
   
   - Court of appeals lawfully issued a writ of certiorari after a trial court granted its own motion for appropriate relief because there was a conspicuous absence of any mention in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1422" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1422</a></cite> of either <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1420ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1420(d)</a></cite> or sua sponte motions; the absence of limiting language regarding review of sua sponte motions meant the jurisdiction prescribed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-32ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7A-32(c)</a></cite> remained unchanged, and the court of appeals had subject matter jurisdiction to issue the writ. State v. Thomsen, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 22</cite>, 789 S.E.2d 639 (2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction When State Appeals.
   
   - Appeal of the motion for appropriate relief would have fallen under the statute section by writ of certiorari; given that the state constitution authorizes the General Assembly to define the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to supervise and control trial court proceedings, and there no limiting language regarding which party may appeal a ruling on a motion for appropriate relief, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to hear an appeal by the State of a motion for appropriate relief when the defendant won relief, and while the appellate rule might appear to limit the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, the rules cannot take away jurisdiction given by the General Assembly. State v. Stubbs, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 40</cite>, 770 S.E.2d 74 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal by Trustees of Charitable Trust.
   
   - Although an appeal by the trustees of a charitable trust was subject to dismissal on the ground that there were no parties aggrieved by the order of the superior court modifying the trust, the Court of Appeals nonetheless could consider the appeal, in the exercise of its supervisory power, where the order would affect the interests of a substantial number of public and private hospitals in the State, as well as thousands of persons who would be hospitalized as charity patients. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 176 S.E.2d 860 (1970).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Adequate Foundation Requires Physical Evidence to Show Abuse.
   
   - Writ of certiorari was granted because an inmate was not entitled to relief under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1415ol1b7" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1415(b)(7)</a></cite>, as there had been no significant change in law regarding expert opinion evidence since defendant's convictions; cases simply applied the existing law on expert opinion evidence, which was that before expert testimony may have been admitted under G.S. 8C-1-702, an adequate foundation had to be laid, and for expert testimony presenting a definitive diagnosis of sexual abuse, an adequate foundation required supporting physical evidence of the abuse. State v. Chandler, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 313</cite>, 697 S.E.2d 327 (Aug. 27, 2010).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Exercise of Discretionary Duties by Public Official.
   
   - Neither mandamus nor a mandatory injunction may be issued to control the manner of a public official's exercise of a discretionary duty. White v. Pate, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 293 S.E.2d 601 (1982), modified, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 759</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 199 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Review of Judicial Disciplinary Proceedings.
   
   - Under N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   12 and this section, the courts of the appellate division have power to review judicial disciplinary proceedings whether the attorney or the State has prevailed in the trial court. In re Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 638</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 784 (1979).

       Review of Attorney Disciplinary Proceedings.
   
   - Court of Appeals of North Carolina lacked jurisdiction to hear the State Bar of North Carolina's appeal of a grant of summary judgment to an attorney in a disciplinary proceeding because <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.084.html#t84a04s84-28ol1h" target="_blank">G.S. 84-28(h)</a></cite> provided no appeal from a final order that did not impose discipline, and in the instant case no discipline had been imposed; further, certiorari was inappropriate because the case did not fall within the rubric of N.C. R. App. P. 21(a)(1) and the court declined to suspend the requirement of Rule 21(a)(1) using N.C. R. App. P. 2. N.C. State Bar v. Rudisill, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 704, 583 S.E.2d 413 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       State Must Seek Review of Disciplinary Proceedings by Writ of Certiorari.
   
   - The State may seek review by the appellate division of proceedings disciplining attorneys under the judicial method. However, the State may not appeal in such cases as a matter of right, but must seek appellate review by petition for writ of certiorari. In re Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 638</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 784 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Relief Where Issue Not Presented in Brief.
   
   - Plaintiff 's failure to present and argue in its brief to the Court of Appeals the propriety of the trial court's judgment as to attorneys' fees precluded plaintiff from obtaining relief on this point in the Court of Appeals as a matter of right; however, the Court of Appeals, in the exercise of its general supervisory powers under subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to N.C.R.A.P., Rule 2, could consider on its own initiative the question of the attorneys' fees award and give relief as a matter of appellate grace. Stillwell Enters., Inc. v. Interstate Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 286</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 812 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Or When Counsel Fails to Follow Statutory Procedures.
   
   - Even though counsel employed by defendant failed to follow the statutory procedure for appealing to the Court of Appeals, because of the important issues raised by the appeal, defendant's petition for writ of certiorari, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-32ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7A-32(c)</a></cite>, and pursuant to N.C.R.A.P., Rule 21, was allowed. State v. Hamrick, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 60, 428 S.E.2d 830, appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 436</cite>, 433 S.E.2d 181 (1993).

        Writ Issued Despite Plaintiffs' Failure to Petition for One.
       </b>
       - Court exercised its discretion to issue a writ of certiorari in this case, ignoring plaintiffs' failure to petition for one, as there were wide-reaching issues of justice and liberty at stake and plaintiffs' issues on appeal were meritorious; specifically, the lawsuit alleged serious misconduct and abuse of power by the government in violation of both the U.S. Constitution and the state's common law.

       Denial of Class Certification Review Appropriate.
   
   - Although a trial court's denial of class certification was an interlocutory order, appellate review was justified where the number of tobacco support price program members exceeded 800,000, and thus, the case's subject matter implicated a public interest to large degree and supervisory authority was appropriate under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-32ol1b2015" target="_self">G.S. 7A-32(b)(2015)</a></cite>.

       Appellate Court Should Have Exercised Jurisdiction.
   
   - While the Court of Appeals correctly acknowledged that it had jurisdiction to issue the writ of certiorari, it mistakenly concluded that the absence of a specific "procedural process" in the Rules of Appellate Procedure left the court without authority to invoke that jurisdiction. State v. Ledbetter, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 192</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 39 (2018), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 819 S.E.2d 591, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C.

       Adoption of Procedural Rule Did Not Affect Action Already Pending.
   
   - Given the unique constitutional and statutory responsibilities of the Supreme Court of North Carolina to promulgate rules of appellate procedure, as well as rules and standards of conduct for the judiciary, the Supreme Court of North Carolina did not exceed its authority in adopting N.C. Code Jud. Conduct, Limitation of Proceedings; however, where a judicial disciplinary action was already pending when N.C. Code Jud. Conduct, Limitation of Proceedings came into effect, the action was not barred. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge (Brown), <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 711</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 502 (2004).

       The Supreme Court of North Carolina may adopt rules governing this procedure and may supervise its implementation and operation through the Administrative Office of the Courts.

       § 7A-38.1. Mediated settlement conferences in superior court civil actions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1a">
       Purpose. - The General Assembly finds that a system of court-ordered mediated settlement conferences should be established to facilitate the settlement of superior court civil actions and to make civil litigation more economical, efficient, and satisfactory to litigants and the State. Therefore, this section is enacted to require parties to superior court civil actions and their representatives to attend a pretrial, mediated settlement conference conducted pursuant to this section and pursuant to rules of the Supreme Court adopted to implement this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1b">
       Definitions. - As used in this section:
       <ol>
        <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1b1">
         "Mediated settlement conference" means a pretrial, court-ordered conference of the parties to a civil action and their representatives conducted by a mediator.
        </li>
        <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1b2">
         "Mediation" means an informal process conducted by a mediator with the objective of helping parties voluntarily settle their dispute.
        </li>
        <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1b3">
         "Mediator" means a neutral person who acts to encourage and facilitate a resolution of a pending civil action. A mediator does not make an award or render a judgment as to the merits of the action.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1c">
       Rules of procedure. - The Supreme Court may adopt rules to implement this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1d">
       Statewide implementation. - Mediated settlement conferences authorized by this section shall be implemented in all judicial districts as soon as practicable, as determined by the Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1e">
       Cases selected for mediated settlement conferences. - The senior resident superior court judge of any participating district may order a mediated settlement conference for any superior court civil action pending in the district. The senior resident superior court judge may by local rule order all cases, not otherwise exempted by the Supreme Court rule, to mediated settlement conference.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1f">
       Attendance of parties. - The parties to a superior court civil action in which a mediated settlement conference is ordered, their attorneys and other persons or entities with authority, by law or by contract, to settle the parties' claims shall attend the mediated settlement conference unless excused by rules of the Supreme Court or by order of the senior resident superior court judge. Nothing in this section shall require any party or other participant in the conference to make a settlement offer or demand which it deems is contrary to its best interests.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1g">
       Sanctions. - Any person required to attend a mediated settlement conference or other settlement procedure under this section who, without good cause, fails to attend or fails to pay any or all of the mediator's or other neutral's fee in compliance with this section and the rules promulgated by the Supreme Court to implement this section is subject to the contempt powers of the court and monetary sanctions imposed by a resident or presiding superior court judge. The monetary sanctions may include the payment of fines, attorneys' fees, mediator and neutral fees, and the expenses and loss of earnings incurred by persons attending the procedure. A party seeking sanctions against another party or person shall do so in a written motion stating the grounds for the motion and the relief sought. The motion shall be served upon all parties and upon any person against whom the sanctions are being sought. The court may initiate sanction proceedings upon its own motion by the entry of a show cause order. If the court imposes sanctions, it shall do so, after notice and a hearing, in a written order, making findings of fact and conclusions of law. An order imposing sanctions shall be reviewable upon appeal where the entire record as submitted shall be reviewed to determine whether the order is supported by substantial evidence.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1h">
       Selection of mediator. - The parties to a superior court civil action in which a mediated settlement conference is to be held pursuant to this section shall have the right to designate a mediator. Upon failure of the parties to designate a mediator within the time established by the rules of the Supreme Court, a mediator shall be appointed by the senior resident superior court judge.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1i">
       Promotion of other settlement procedures. - Nothing in this section is intended to preclude the use of other dispute resolution methods within the superior court. Parties to a superior court civil action are encouraged to select other available dispute resolution methods. The senior resident superior court judge, at the request of and with the consent of the parties, may order the parties to attend and participate in any other settlement procedure authorized by rules of the Supreme Court or by the local superior court rules, in lieu of attending a mediated settlement conference. Neutral third parties acting pursuant to this section shall be selected and compensated in accordance with such rules or pursuant to agreement of the parties. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the parties from participating in, or the court from ordering, other dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration to the extent authorized under State or federal law.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1j">
       Immunity. - Mediator and other neutrals acting pursuant to this section shall have judicial immunity in the same manner and to the same extent as a judge of the General Court of Justice, except that mediators and other neutrals may be disciplined in accordance with enforcement procedures adopted by the Supreme Court pursuant to G.S. 7A-38.2.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1k">
       Costs of mediated settlement conference. - Costs of mediated settlement conferences shall be borne by the parties. Unless otherwise ordered by the court or agreed to by the parties, the mediator's fees shall be paid in equal shares by the parties. For purposes of this section, multiple parties shall be considered one party when they are represented by the same counsel. The rules adopted by the Supreme Court implementing this section shall set out a method whereby parties found by the court to be unable to pay the costs of the mediated settlement conference are afforded an opportunity to participate without cost. The rules adopted by the Supreme Court shall set the fees to be paid a mediator appointed by a judge upon the failure of the parties to designate a mediator.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1l">
       Inadmissibility of negotiations. - Evidence of statements made and conduct occurring in a mediated settlement conference or other settlement proceeding conducted under this section, whether attributable to a party, the mediator, other neutral, or a neutral observer present at the settlement proceeding, shall not be subject to discovery and shall be inadmissible in any proceeding in the action or other civil actions on the same claim, except:
       <ol>
        <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1l1">
         In proceedings for sanctions under this section;
        </li>
        <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1l2">
         In proceedings to enforce or rescind a settlement of the action;
        </li>
        <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1l3">
         In disciplinary hearings before the State Bar or the Dispute Resolution Commission; or
        </li>
        <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1l4">
         In proceedings to enforce laws concerning juvenile or elder abuse.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1m">
       Right to jury trial. - Nothing in this section or the rules adopted by the Supreme Court implementing this section shall restrict the right to jury trial.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      As used in this section, the term "neutral observer" includes persons seeking mediator certification, persons studying dispute resolution processes, and persons acting as interpreters.
     </p>
     <p>
      No settlement agreement to resolve any or all issues reached at the proceeding conducted under this subsection or during its recesses shall be enforceable unless it has been reduced to writing and signed by the parties against whom enforcement is sought. No evidence otherwise discoverable shall be inadmissible merely because it is presented or discussed in a mediated settlement conference or other settlement proceeding.
     </p>
     <p>
      No mediator, other neutral, or neutral observer present at a settlement proceeding shall be compelled to testify or produce evidence concerning statements made and conduct occurring in anticipation of, during, or as a follow-up to a mediated settlement conference or other settlement proceeding pursuant to this section in any civil proceeding for any purpose, including proceedings to enforce or rescind a settlement of the action, except to attest to the signing of any agreements, and except proceedings for sanctions under this section, disciplinary hearings before the State Bar or the Dispute Resolution Commission, and proceedings to enforce laws concerning juvenile or elder abuse.

       Sanctions for Failure to Attend.
   
   - Trial court did not abuse its discretion by striking defendant's answer and entering default where corporate defendant had no good cause for failing to have officer mediation settlement conference and was not excused, less severe sanctions were considered rejected as inappropriate, and the sanctions entered were specifically authorized by former Rule 37(b)(2)c (repealed by 1993 Session Laws, c. 553, s. 1). Triad Mack Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v. Clement Bros. Co., <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 438 S.E.2d 485 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike this section, authorizing mediated settlement conferences in superior court civil actions, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-37.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-37.1</a></cite> does not require the attendance of the parties, their attorneys and other persons or entities with authority, by law or by contract, to settle the parties' claims, nor does the court-ordered arbitration statute require sanctions as does the mediated settlement conference statute; thus, there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court's sanction based on the fact that defendant motorist appeared at the arbitration only through his counsel. Bledsole v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 133</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 379 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a homeowner's children and friends were not excused from attending a court-ordered mediation, they could be sanctioned unless they showed good cause for their absences when a mediator's report specifically identified the friends as parties absent without permission, and the mediator did not specify that the children's absence was authorized; even assuming that the report could be read as indicating the mediator's express permission for the absences, the mediator lacked authority to grant such permission under Rule 4(A)(2) of the Rules for Statewide Mediated Settlement Conferences and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7A-38.1(f)</a></cite>. Perry v. GRP Fin. Servs. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 674 S.E.2d 780 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in failing to make any findings related to the reasonableness of the attorneys' fees sought and awarded for the failure of a homeowner's children and friends to attend court-ordered mediation because it made no findings of fact at all other than to reiterate the amount of attorneys' fees sought by each party, and on remand, the trial court had to make further findings of fact regarding the amount of any sanction ultimately awarded; there is no reason to distinguish an award of sanctions under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-38.1</a></cite> and Rule 5 of the Rules for Statewide Mediated Settlement Conferences from sanctions awarded under N.C. R. Civ. P. 11 and 37, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-21.1" target="_blank">G.S. 6-21.1</a></cite>, all of which require a finding of reasonableness. Perry v. GRP Fin. Servs. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 674 S.E.2d 780 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in imposing sanctions upon a homeowner's children and friends for their absence at court-ordered mediation because the trial court did not make sufficient findings of fact on the issue of whether the children and friends showed good cause for their absence; the friends submitted affidavits explaining the reason for their physical absence, but the trial court never explained why it decided that those reasons did not amount to "good cause."

   - Trial court was without authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-38.1ol1g" target="_self">G.S. 7A-38.1(g)</a></cite>, or its inherent authority, to sanction the parents for violating the terms of the settlement agreement because the parents complied with the Mediation Rules in creating a settlement agreement but subsequently violated the terms of the agreement. Estate of Barber v. Guilford County Sheriff's Dep't, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 658, 589 S.E.2d 433 (2003).

      </p>
      <p>
       Mediator May Be Compelled for Evidence of Agreement.
   
   - A mediator is both competent and compellable to testify or produce evidence on whether the parties reached a settlement agreement, where a judge is making that determination. Few v. Hammack Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 511 S.E.2d 665 (1999).

      <p>
       Mediation Settlement Outcomes Admissible.
   
   - Admission of the outcome of a mediation settlement conference is not prohibited where a judge is making a determination of whether an agreement was reached and the terms of the agreement. Few v. Hammack Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 511 S.E.2d 665 (1999).

      <p>
       Admission of Confidential Mediation Information.
   
   - When, in a builder's suit against a homeowner to enforce a lien, the homeowner was granted summary judgment, the homeowner was not awarded appellate attorneys' fees because no transcripts or evidence allowed the appellate court to decipher how statutorily confidential mediation information was admitted into evidence, or what other evidence the trial court considered.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A party who claims that a settlement agreement is invalid and unenforceable
   
   should have to overcome the strong presumption expressed in this section that a settlement agreement reached by the parties through court-ordered mediation under the guidance of a mediator is a valid contract. Chappell v. Roth, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 539 S.E.2d 666 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversation Not Part of Negotiations.
   
   - The trial judge properly determined that admitted portions of an answering machine message and a subsequent conversation between the plaintiff mother of a boy injured on an amusement ride and the deceased defendant ride operator in which he admitted the possibility that he had not fastened the boy properly were not part of settlement negotiations; there was no mention of an intent to compromise or negotiate in the admitted portions of the conversation and the testimony was an admission of fact during a telephone conversation initiated by a party to the dispute. Breedlove v. Aerotrim, U.S.A., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 543 S.E.2d 213 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Breach.
   
   - Record supported the trial court's judgment that a general contractor made three of six payments it was required to make under a settlement agreement on time, that a subcontractor that was entitled to receive those payments breached the settlement agreement by refusing to authorize release of a letter of credit, and that the general contractor was relieved of its obligation to make the remaining payments because of the subcontractor's breach. McClure Lumber Co. v. Helmsman Constr., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 585 S.E.2d 234 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary Judgment Proper Upon Reaching Settlement Agreement.
   
   - Where the parties to a real estate commission dispute reached a settlement agreement at mediation, but the brokerage did not sign the written settlement agreement, and never moved the trial court to enforce the settlement agreement, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment dismissing the case rather than entering an order enforcing the agreement. Cohen Schatz Assocs. v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 834, 611 S.E.2d 229 (2005).

        Failure of One Party to Sign Settlement Agreement.
       </b>
       - Plaintiff was not entitled to enforcement of the memorandum of settlement as a matter of law because defendant failed to sign the memorandum of settlement, making it unenforceable against him under the statute of frauds. Mitchell v. Boswell, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 3, 2020).

       Negligent Misrepresentation Claim Not Stated.

      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.3Eol1e">
       Waiver of Mediation. - The parties to the dispute may waive the mediation required by this section by informing the mediator of the parties' waiver in writing. No costs shall be assessed to any party if all parties waive mediation prior to the occurrence of an initial mediation meeting.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.3Eol1f">
       Certification That Mediation Concluded. - Immediately upon a waiver of mediation under subsection (e) of this section or upon the conclusion of mediation, the mediator shall prepare a certification stating the date on which the mediation was concluded and the general results of the mediation, including, as applicable, that the parties waived the mediation, that an agreement was reached, that mediation was attempted but an agreement was not reached, or that one or more parties, to be specified in the certification, failed or refused without good cause to attend one or more mediation meetings or otherwise participate in the mediation.

       Failure to Comply.
   
   - Trial court erred in determining that two documents were subject to disclosure under State's Public Records Act and in ordering them to be produced under seal to an applicant because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the challenged order inasmuch as the applicant conceded that he did not initiate mediation within 30 days of the town's filing of a responsive pleading.

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.5ol1a">
       The General Assembly finds that it is in the public interest to encourage the establishment of community mediation centers, also known as dispute settlement centers or dispute resolution centers, to support the work of these centers in facilitating communication, understanding, reconciliation, and settlement of conflicts in communities, courts, and schools, and to promote the widest possible use of these centers by the courts and law enforcement officials across the State. A center may establish and charge fees for its services other than for criminal court mediations. Fees for criminal court mediation are set forth in G.S. 7A-38.7, and centers and mediators shall not charge any other fees in such cases.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.5ol1b">
       Community mediation centers, functioning as or within nonprofit organizations and local governmental entities, may receive referrals from courts, law enforcement agencies, and other public entities for the purpose of facilitating communication, understanding, reconciliation, and settlement of conflicts.

      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.5ol1c">
       Each chief district court judge and district attorney shall encourage mediation for any criminal district court action pending in the district when the judge and district attorney determine that mediation is an appropriate alternative.

      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIa05s7A-38.5ol1e">
       Except as provided in this subsection and subsection (f) of this section, each chief district court judge and district attorney shall refer any misdemeanor criminal action in district court that is generated by a citizen-initiated arrest warrant or criminal summons to the local mediation center for resolution, except for (i) any case involving domestic violence; (ii) any case in which the judge or the district attorney determine that mediation would be inappropriate; or (iii) any case being tried in a county in which mediation services are not available. The mediation center shall have 45 days to resolve each case and report back to the court with a resolution. The district attorney shall delay prosecution in order for the mediation to occur. If the case is not resolved through mediation within 45 days of referral, or if any party declines to enter into mediation, the court may proceed with the case as a criminal action. For purposes of this section, the term "citizen-initiated arrest warrant or criminal summons" means a warrant or summons issued pursuant to G.S. 15A-303 or G.S. 15A-304 by a magistrate or other judicial official based upon information supplied through the oath or affirmation of a private citizen.

Prior to mediation, the court shall cause the mediation participants to be informed that the dispute resolution fee shall be paid as part of any mediation of a criminal case. The fee shall be paid to the clerk in advance of the mediation. Fees assessed under this section shall be paid to the clerk of superior court in the county where the case was filed and remitted by the clerk to the Mediation Network of North Carolina. The Mediation Network may retain up to three dollars ($3.00) of this amount as an allowance for its administrative expenses. The Mediation Network must remit the remainder of this amount to the community mediation center that mediated the case. The court may waive or reduce a fee assessed under this section only upon entry of a written order, supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law, determining there is just cause to grant the waiver or reduction.

       All related criminal charges per defendant that are subject to mediation shall be treated as a single criminal case for the purpose of calculating the sixty-dollar ($60.00) dispute resolution fee. In advance of the mediation, the participants, including all complainants, defendants, and other parties to the mediation, shall discuss whether the dispute resolution fee shall be allocated between them. If the participants do not reach agreement on an allocation of the dispute resolution fee, then the fee shall be the responsibility of the defendant, unless the court waives or reduces the fee upon entry of a written order, supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law, determining there is just cause to waive or reduce the fee. In connection with any mediation subject to this section, no mediator or any other community mediation center volunteer or employee shall receive any payment directly from any participant in the mediation, regardless of whether the payment is a dispute resolution fee, cost of court, restitution, or any other fee required by law or court order.

      Every justice of the Supreme Court or judge of the Court of Appeals who has served for eight years or more on the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or the superior court, or as Administrative Officer of the Courts, or in any combination of these offices, and who while in active service becomes totally and permanently disabled so as to be unable to perform efficiently the duties of his office, and who retires by reason of such disability, shall receive for life compensation equal to two thirds of the annual salary from time to time received by the occupant or occupants of the office from which he retired. In determining whether a judge is eligible for retirement under this section, time served as district solicitor of the superior court prior to January 1, 1971, may be included. Whenever any justice or judge claims retirement benefits under this section on account of total and permanent disability, the Governor and Council of State, acting together, shall, after notice and an opportunity to be heard is given the applicant, by a majority vote of said body, make findings of fact from the evidence offered. Such findings of fact shall be reduced to writing and entered upon the minutes of the Council of State. The findings so made shall be conclusive as to such matters and determine the right of the applicant to retirement benefits under this section. Justices and judges retired under the provisions of this section are not subject to recall as emergency justices or judges.

        1987 Amendment Held Constitutional.
   
   - The provisions of Session Laws 1987, c. 509, which amended subsection (d) of this section, did not violate the North Carolina Constitution. State ex rel. Martin v. Preston, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 438</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 473 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of Session Laws 1987, c. 509, which amended subsection (d) of this section, creating a one-time delay of elections and a one-time interim or hiatus between terms of office for certain superior court judgeships (causing the incumbents to hold over until the next elections were held and the succeeding terms of office began) served a public purpose and did not violate the Constitution of North Carolina. State ex rel. Martin v. Preston, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 438</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 473 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        By enacting Session Laws 1987, c. 509, the legislature eliminated staggered terms within multi-seat judicial districts by creating a one-time interim or hiatus between certain terms of office; as the Constitution anticipates such "hold over" situations by providing that elected judges remain in office "until their successors are elected and qualified," the act was not unconstitutional. State ex rel. Martin v. Preston, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 438</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 473 (1989).

         Preclearance of Acts Pursuant to Voting Rights Act.

        - Where superior court judges were elected pursuant to Session Laws 1965, c. 262, Session Laws 1967, c. 997, Session Laws 1977, cc. 1119, 1130 and 1238, and Session Laws 1983, c. 1109, and such legislative acts had not been precleared by the Attorney General as required by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C.

        1973c, the federal district court would enjoin such elections retroactively in those counties subject to section 5 of the Voting Rights Act; the fact that an election law deals with the election of members of the judiciary does not remove it from the ambit of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Haith v. Martin, 618 F. Supp. 410 (E.D.N.C. 1985), aff'd, 477 U.S. 901, 106 S. Ct. 3268, 91 L. Ed. 2d 559 (1986).

       <p>
        Elections proposed to be held in Judicial Districts 3, 4, 8 and 12 would not offend provisions of federal court order of Sept. 24, 1985, and thus would not be enjoined, as such elections would not result in any retrogression in the voting right privileges of racial minorities in those districts, and the judgeships to be filled in those districts in 1986, all of which were created under law prior to section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, have not become an integral part of the voting procedures established by the North Carolina statutes creating new judgeships in those districts.

        Obligation to Provide "Suitable" Facilities.
   
   - In cities other than county seats where sessions of superior court are held, boards of commissioners are obligated by statute to provide "suitable" places for holding such sessions of court. In re Alamance County Ct. Facilities, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 84</cite>, 405 S.E.2d 125 (1991).

        Hearing Ordered to Probe Adequacy of Court Facilities.
   
   - A hearing ordered by a superior court judge to inquire into the adequacy of the Alamance County court facilities probes the scope of the court's inherent power to direct county commissioners to ameliorate such facilities and the proper means of effecting that end. Such power exists, but the order invoking it was procedurally and substantively flawed where the commissioners against whom the order was directed were not made parties to the action, the order was ex parte, and the order intruded on discretion that properly belonged to the commissioners. In re Alamance County Ct. Facilities, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 84</cite>, 405 S.E.2d 125 (1991).

Until confirmed by the General Assembly and appointed by the Governor, or appointed by the General Assembly upon the failure of the Governor to appoint a nominee, and qualified by taking the oath of office, a nominee is neither a de jure nor a de facto officer.

         </b>
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        A special judge enjoys the power and authority of a regular judge only during the session of court
   
   in that county in which the special judge is duly appointed to hold court. Green ex rel. Green v. Maness, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 316 S.E.2d 911, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 621</cite>, 323 S.E.2d 922 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Jurisdiction When Not Holding Term of Court.
   
   - A special or emergency judge has no authority to determine a controversy without action at chambers when not holding a term of court. Greene v. Stadiem, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 472</cite>, 149 S.E. 685 (1929). See Bohannon v. Virginia Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. 702</cite>, 153 S.E. 263 (1930).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Special Judge May Hear Matter Out of Term by Consent.
   
   - Once having acquired jurisdiction at term, a special or emergency judge, by consent, may hear the matter out of term nunc pro tunc. Shepard v. Leonard, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 110</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 445 (1943).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A judgment signed by a special judge out-of-session without the consent of the parties is void.
   
   Green ex rel. Green v. Maness, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 316 S.E.2d 911, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 621</cite>, 323 S.E.2d 922 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judicial Notice of Appointment as Special Judge.
   
   - The appellate court will take judicial notice on appeal of the appointment of a certain person as a special judge. Greene v. Stadiem, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 472</cite>, 149 S.E. 685 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        When necessary for the determination of a case on appeal, the appellate court will take judicial notice of the counties comprising a judicial district, and that a judge holding a term in one of the counties was a special judge appointed by the Governor. Reid v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 740</cite>, 155 S.E. 719 (1930).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motions in Cause Made at Term.
   
   - Civil actions pending on the civil issue docket of a county are always subject to motion in the cause. These motions may be made before the judge at term. In many instances they may be made out of term. When made at term the judge presiding, whether regular or special, has jurisdiction. To this extent this section has full constitutional sanction. Shepard v. Leonard, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 110</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 445 (1943).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Proceeding to Obtain Custody of Child.
   
   - A special judge has concurrent jurisdiction with the judge of the district to hear and determine a proceeding instituted by the mother of a child to obtain its custody, provided the proceeding can be heard and judgment rendered during the term of court the special judge is commissioned to hold. In re Cranford, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 91</cite>, 56 S.E.2d 35 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion for Alimony.
   
   - Where a special judge was authorized under commission of the Governor to hold a term of court in only one county of a district, he could not issue an order for alimony, attorneys' fees and costs in a proceeding in an action for divorce a vinculo pending in another county of the district and continued to be heard before a judge regularly holding the terms of court in that district. Public Laws 1929, c. 137, under which the special judge was commissioned, provided that writs, orders and notices should be returnable before special judges only in the county where the suit, proceeding or other cause was pending, unless such special judge was then holding the courts of that district, in which case the same might be returnable before him as before the regular judge. Reid v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 740</cite>, 155 S.E. 719 (1930).

   - Once a matter has been designated as a complex business case, the clerk of court still maintains the case file; therefore, unless and until the Appellate Rules are amended to provide otherwise, the orders of the business court, just like the orders of any other superior court, must be appealed through the filing of a notice of appeal with the applicable clerk of court in accordance with the procedures set out in N.C.

        The power to order special terms
   
   is not restricted to instances where there is accumulation of business, nor, when such fact is recited as a reason in the commission, is the power of the judge restricted to the trial of indictments found before that term.

        "Vacation" or "In Chambers" Jurisdiction Generally.
   
   - A regular judge holding the courts of the district has general jurisdiction of all "in chambers" matters arising in the district. The general "vacation" or "in chambers" jurisdiction of a regular judge arises out of his general authority. Usually it may be exercised anywhere in the district, and it is never dependent upon and does not arise out of the fact that he is at the time presiding over a designated term of court or in a particular county. As to him, it is limited, ordinarily, to the district to which he is assigned by statute. It may not be exercised even within the district of his residence except when specially authorized by statute. Baker v. Varser, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 180</cite>, 79 S.E.2d 757 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Matters and proceedings not requiring the intervention of a jury, or in which trial by jury has been waived, may be heard in vacation. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581 (1962).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Consent of Parties Required.
   
   - A judge has no power to render judgment after the expiration of the term of court without the consent of parties. Hardin v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 364</cite> (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        By consent, the superior court can grant judgment in civil cases in vacation. Coates Bros. v. Wilkes, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 174</cite> (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        After leaving the bench for a term of the superior court to expire by limitation, the judge cannot hear motions or other matters outside of the courtroom except by consent, unless they are such as are cognizable at chambers. May v. National Fire Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 795</cite>, 90 S.E. 890 (1916).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Transaction of Business Out of Term.
   
   - The courts have recognized the power and authority of the legislature to provide for the transaction of business in the superior court out of term except for the trial of issues of fact requiring a jury. Capital Outdoor Adv., Inc. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 150</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 289 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The judge holding the courts of a judicial district has authority to act in all matters
   
   within the jurisdiction of the superior court, with the consent of the parties, by signing judgments out of term and in or out of the county and out of the district. Edmundson v. Edmundson, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 181</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 576 (1942).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction Limited to District.
   
   - The jurisdiction of a superior court judge is ordinarily limited to the district in which he resides. Vance Constr. Co. v. Duane White Land Corp., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 490 S.E.2d 588 (1997).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Demurrers May Be Heard in Chambers.
   
   - A special judge has jurisdiction in the county of his residence to hear and determine in chambers a demurrer to the complaint in an action pending in the county. Parker v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 308</cite>, 79 S.E.2d 765 (1954); Scott v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 642</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 478 (1963).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Motions for Judgment of Voluntary Nonsuit.
   
   - A resident judge has jurisdiction to hear and determine in chambers a motion for judgment of voluntary nonsuit. Scott v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 642</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 478 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Actions Involving Title to Bank Accounts.
   
   - A regular judge has jurisdiction to hear and determine in chambers an action involving title to a bank account in which the answer raised no issues of fact. Scott v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 642</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 478 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Interlocutory Order.
   
   - The superior court has power to make an amendment to an interlocutory order in an ancillary proceeding out of term. Coates Bros. v. Wilkes, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 174</cite> (1886).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where resident judge issued order to defendant wife to appear outside county and outside district
   
   to show cause why temporary order awarding custody of children to husband should not be made permanent, it was held that the judge was without jurisdiction to hear the matter outside the district, and an order issued upon the hearing of the order to show cause was void ab initio.

       <p>
        Mandamus Proceedings in Another District Not Within Jurisdiction.
   
   - A regular judge of the superior court while assigned by rotation to hold the courts of the judicial district of his residence has no jurisdiction to hear a petition for mandamus in chambers in another judicial district to which he is not assigned to hold court. Baker v. Varser, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 180</cite>, 79 S.E.2d 757 (1954).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Jurisdiction to Order Payment of Expenses Out of the Recovery.
   
   - In an action by taxpayers against public officers under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.128.html#t128a01s128-10" target="_blank">G.S. 128-10</a></cite> to recover public funds unlawfully expended, plaintiffs disclaimed in their complaint any right personally to participate in the recovery. After recovery and the entry of a consent judgment dismissing appeals, and after payment of the judgment, the resident judge, on petition of one of the original taxpayer plaintiffs, was then without jurisdiction under this section to order payments, out of the recovery, of such petitioner's expenses and counsel fees. Hill v. Stanbury, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 356</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 150 (1944), commented on in 23 N.C.L. Rev. 40 (1945).

An emergency judge duly assigned to hold the courts of a county or district or set of districts as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa07s7A-41.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-41.1(a)</a></cite> has the same powers in that county and district or set of districts in open court and in chambers as a resident judge of the district or set of districts or any judge regularly assigned to hold the courts of the district or set of districts would have, but his jurisdiction in chambers extends only until the session is adjourned or the session expires by operation of law, whichever is later.

        Jurisdiction to Order Expenses and Fees Paid.
   
   - Emergency superior court judge commissioned to preside over a Special Session of County Superior Court continuing two weeks, or until the business was completed, had jurisdiction to sign order taxing deposition expenses and witness fees 6 weeks later. Hockaday v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 477 S.E.2d 82 (1996), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 178</cite>, 486 S.E.2d 204 (1997).

        Limitations on Jurisdiction.
   
   - The power and authority given to emergency judges are to be exercised only "in the courts which they are assigned to hold." The jurisdiction of an emergency judge "in chambers" terminates with the adjournment or termination of the term of court which he is assigned to hold. Lewis v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 642</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 715 (1953). But the statute places no such limitation on the "in term" jurisdiction of an emergency judge. Strickland v. Kornegay, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 758</cite>, 83 S.E.2d 903 (1954).

        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Give Notice.
   
   - Due notice must be given of motions in civil actions to be heard at a criminal term of court, and where the movant failed to give the statutory notice of his motion, and the superior court ordered a dismissal of the action, the judgment was reversed on appeal. Dawkins v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 608</cite>, 116 S.E. 723 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        The superior court has authority to hear motions in civil actions at criminal terms only after due notice to the adverse party, and therefore when it did not affirmatively appear that due notice was given of plaintiff's motion to be allowed to amend, the granting of the motion at a term of court for criminal cases only would be held to be error as being presumptively outside the authority of the court. Beck v. Lexington Coca-Cola Bottling Co., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 579</cite>, 5 S.E.2d 855 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice of Motion for Default.
   
   - Under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 7, an application for default judgment is considered a motion in a civil action; therefore, as subsection (a) of this section requires notice to be given before motions in civil actions may be heard at criminal sessions of court, and no notice was given defendant, default judgment granted plaintiff would be vacated. Miller v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 196 S.E.2d 44, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 665</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 874 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion for New Trial in Criminal Case May Not Be Determined at Civil Term.
   
   - A motion which, if allowed, would set aside a verdict and judgment in a case on the criminal docket, specifically, a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, may not be determined at a term expressly restricted by statute as a term "for the trial of civil cases only." Such a motion is for determination at a term of the court (in which the verdict and judgment to which the motion is addressed were rendered) provided for the trial of criminal cases. In re Renfrow, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 55</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 315 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Contested Divorce Action at Civil Session.
   
   - The purported trial of a contested divorce action conducted over defendant's protest and in disregard of his motion for continuance for trial at a civil session was a nullity. Branch v. Branch, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 133</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 671 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction to Hear Criminal Case.
   
   - Trial court that was assigned to hold civil court had jurisdiction to conduct a criminal trial where an order from the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court mandated that the trial court hear both civil and criminal cases. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 515, 512 S.E.2d 436 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>

        Setting and Publishing of Trial Calendar. - No less than 10 working days before cases are calendared for trial, the district attorney shall publish the trial calendar. The trial calendar shall schedule the cases in the order in which the district attorney anticipates they will be called for trial and should not contain cases that the district attorney does not reasonably expect to be called for trial. In counties in which multiple sessions of court are being held, the district attorney may publish a trial calendar for each session of court.

Deviations from the announced order require approval by the presiding judge if the defendant whose case is called for trial objects; but the defendant may not object if all the cases scheduled to be heard before the defendant's case have been disposed of or delayed with the approval of the presiding judge or by consent of the State and the defendant. A case may be continued from the trial calendar only by consent of the State and the defendant or upon order of the presiding judge or resident superior court judge for good cause shown.

       If the parties have not otherwise agreed upon a trial date, then upon the conclusion of the final administrative setting, the district attorney shall announce a proposed trial date. The court shall set that date as the tentative trial date unless, after providing the parties an opportunity to be heard, the court determines that the interests of justice require the setting of a different date. In that event, the district attorney shall set another tentative trial date during the final administrative setting. The trial shall occur no sooner than 30 days after the final administrative setting, except by agreement of the State and the defendant.

         Prosecutor Controls Calendar.
        </b>
        - Under North Carolina practice, the prosecutor controls the criminal calendar and decides when to set cases for trial. Shirley v. North Carolina, 528 F.2d 819 (4th Cir. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge May Consolidate Calendared and Non-Calendared Charges.
   
   - When read together, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIXa49s15A-926ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-926(a)</a></cite> and subsection (a) former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa07s7A-49.3" target="_self">G.S. 7A-49.3</a></cite> (now see this section) permitted a judge in a criminal trial to consolidate calendared charges with non-calendared charges that were based either on the same act or transaction, or on a series of acts of transactions connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 497 S.E.2d 126 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The ultimate authority over managing the trial calendar is retained in the court,
   
   even though this section gives the district attorney the authority to calendar cases for trial. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 511 S.E.2d 332 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the ultimate authority over managing the trial calendar is retained in the court,
   
   it could not be said that prior similar provision infringed upon the court's inherent authority or vested the district attorney with judicial powers in violation of the separation of powers clause. Simeon v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 358</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 858 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutional Application.
   
   - Where there were allegations the district attorney placed a large number of cases on the printed trial calendar knowing that all cases would not be called, thereby providing defendants virtually no notice of which cases were going to be called for trial, the allegations were sufficient to state a claim that the statutes were being applied in an unconstitutional manner in the Fourteenth Prosecutorial District. Simeon v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 358</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 858 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Filing of Calendar Six Days Before Session.
   
   - Defendant was not prejudiced by the fact that the district attorney filed the calendar of cases to be tried six days before the beginning of the session of the court rather than a full week before the session began as required by this section, particularly where he was not tried until a full week after the calendar had been filed. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 342, 256 S.E.2d 512 (1979).

         No Defense Subpoenas Until Case Calendared.

        - Until the prosecutor files his calendar, criminal defendants are unable to subpoena witnesses, for this section requires defense subpoenas to state the date of trial, a detail which, of course, cannot be known until the case is calendared.

   - A capital murder defendant's right to due process was not impaired by a lack of notice of his arraignment on a certain date as required by this section, where the defendant was fully aware of the charge against him, entered a plea of not guilty to first-degree murder at the arraignment, and was not prevented from filing pretrial motions as a result of the arraignment being held on that date. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 118</cite>, 505 S.E.2d 277 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1075, 119 S. Ct. 1475, 143 L. Ed. 2d 559 (1999).

        Although District Attorney Did Not File Adequate Trial Calendar 10 or More Days Before Trial, Defendant Did Not Establish Prejudice Resulted from Failure to Receive Sufficient Notice.
   
   - Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a continuance and his request to present a rebuttal witness because, while the district attorney did not file an adequate trial calendar 10 or more days before trial, defendant did not establish that he was prejudiced by the failure to receive sufficient notice, the trial court permitted other testimony that established the same facts defendant sought from his rebuttal witness, defendant did not show what testimony his rebuttal witness would provide that might have impacted the outcome of the trial, the trial court permitted defendant to present other rebuttal evidence, and reasonably determined that the rebuttal testimony was repetitive and of limited relevance to the issues at trial.

From the commissioned emergency district, superior, and special superior court judges, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall create two lists of active emergency judges and two lists of inactive emergency judges. For emergency superior and special superior court judges, the active list shall be limited to a combined total of 10 emergency judges; all other emergency superior and special superior court judges shall be on an inactive list.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may order any emergency district, superior, or special superior court judge on an active list who, in his opinion, is competent to perform the duties of a judge, to hold regular or special sessions of the court from which the judge retired, as needed.

      Every judge of the superior court or Administrative Officer of the Courts who has served for eight years or more on the superior court, or as Administrative Officer of the Courts, or on the superior court and as Administrative Officer of
   the Courts combined, and who while in active service becomes totally and permanently disabled so as to be unable to perform efficiently the duties of his office, and who retires by reason of such disability, shall receive for life compensation equal to two thirds of the annual salary from time to time received by the occupant of the office from which he retired. In determining whether a person meets the requirements for retirement under this section, time served as district solicitor of the superior court prior to January 1, 1971, may be included. Whenever any judge claims retirement benefits under this section on account of total and permanent disability, the Governor and Council of State, acting together, shall, after notice and an opportunity to be heard is given the applicant, by a majority vote of said body, make findings of fact from the evidence offered. Such findings of fact shall be reduced to writing and entered upon the minutes of the Council of State. The findings so made shall be conclusive as to such matters and determine the right of the applicant to retirement benefits under this section. Judges retired under the provisions of this section are not subject to recall as emergency judges.

      <p>
       The proper role of the district attorney or privately employed counsel in the prosecution of one charged with a criminal offense
   
   is the conviction of the guilty, the acquittal of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty, appropriate to the circumstances, in the interest of the future protection of society. In the discharge of his duties the prosecuting attorney is not required to be, and should not be, neutral. He is not the judge, but the advocate of the State's interest in the matter at hand.

      <p>
       However, the district attorney should not relinquish the duties of his office to privately employed counsel,
   
   but should remain in charge of and responsible for the prosecution of criminal actions, and except for the most compelling reasons, the trial judge should not permit the district attorney to abdicate his duties.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Selectivity Required in Preparation of Trial Calendar.
   
   - It is the district attorney's statutory duty to prepare the trial docket and prosecute criminal actions in the name of the State. In order to properly perform this duty, he must exercise selectivity in preparing the trial calendar. State v. Cherry, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 86</cite>, 257 S.E.2d 551 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 941, 100 S. Ct. 2165, 64 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1980).

      <p>
       Holding Delinquency Hearing in Absence of District Attorney.
   
   - A contention by a juvenile who was represented by counsel that the trial court erred in proceeding with a delinquency hearing in the absence of the district attorney in that the court was cast in the role of a prosecutor was held without merit where the record showed that someone other than the judge examined witnesses of both the petitioner and the juvenile, and that the questions asked by the court were fair and demonstrated no bias. In re Potts, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 188 S.E.2d 643, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 622</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 471 (1972).

      </p>
      <p>
       Disqualification of Prosecutor for Conflict of Interests.
   
   - A prosecutor may not be disqualified from prosecuting a criminal action in this State unless and until the trial court determines that an actual conflict of interests exists. In this context, an "actual conflict of interests" is demonstrated where a district attorney or a member of his or her staff has previously represented the defendant with regard to the charges to be prosecuted and, as a result of that former attorney-client relationship, the prosecution has obtained confidential information which may be used to the defendant's detriment at trial. Any order of disqualification ordinarily should be directed only to individual prosecutors who have been exposed to such information. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Order to Withdraw Held Improper.
   
   - The trial court exceeded its authority by ordering that in order to avoid the possibility or impression of any conflict of interest, the district attorney and his entire staff must withdraw from a capital case and have no further participation either directly or indirectly with regard to the case. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Constitutional Application.
   
   - Where there were allegations the district attorney placed a large number of cases on the printed trial calendar knowing that all cases would not be called, thereby providing defendants virtually no notice of which cases were going to be called for trial, the allegations were sufficient to state a claim that the statutes were being applied in an unconstitutional manner in the Fourteenth Prosecutorial District. Simeon v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 358</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 858 (1994).

       Knowingly authorizing or permitting an assistant district attorney to commit any act constituting grounds for removal, as defined in subdivisions (1) through (6) hereof.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A proceeding to suspend or remove a district attorney is commenced by filing with the clerk of superior court of the county where the district attorney resides a sworn affidavit charging the district attorney with one or more grounds for removal. The clerk shall immediately bring the matter to the attention of the senior regular resident superior court judge for the district or set of districts as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa07s7A-41.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-41.1(a)</a></cite> in which the county is located who shall within 30 days either review and act on the charges or refer them for review and action within 30 days to another superior court judge residing in or regularly holding the courts of that district or set of districts. If the superior court judge upon review finds that the charges if true constitute grounds for suspension, and finds probable cause for believing that the charges are true, he may enter an order suspending the district attorney from performing the duties of his office until a final determination of the charges on the merits. During the suspension the salary of the district attorney continues. If the superior court judge finds that the charges if true do not constitute grounds for suspension or finds that no probable cause exists for believing that the charges are true, he shall dismiss the proceeding.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a hearing, with or without suspension, is ordered, the district attorney should receive immediate written notice of the proceedings and a true copy of the charges, and the matter shall be set for hearing not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days thereafter. The matter shall be set for hearing before the judge who originally examined the charges or before another regular superior court judge resident in or regularly holding the courts of that district or set of districts. The hearing shall be open to the public. All testimony shall be recorded. At the hearing the superior court judge shall hear evidence and make findings of fact and conclusions of law and if he finds that grounds for removal exist, he shall enter an order permanently removing the district attorney from office, and terminating his salary. If he finds that no grounds exist, he shall terminate the suspension, if any.
     </p>
     <p>
      The district attorney may appeal from an order of removal to the Court of Appeals on the basis of error of law by the superior court judge. Pending decision of the case on appeal, the district attorney shall not perform any of the duties of his office. If, upon final determination, he is ordered reinstated either by the appellate division or by the superior court upon remand his salary shall be restored from the date of the original order of removal.

       Constitutionality.
   
   - This section does not violate the Constitution of North Carolina; thus, the superior court had jurisdiction to remove district attorney. In re Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 404</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 693 (1997).

       Purpose.
   
   - This section aims to create a procedure for the removal of district attorneys by the superior court. In re Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 404</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 693 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority of General Assembly.
   
   - The General Assembly has the authority under the State Constitution to provide by statute for a method of removal of an individual holding the constitutional office of district attorney, although the Constitution does not itself specify any method whatsoever for removal of an individual from that office. In re Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 404</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 693 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither Article IV, Section 18 nor any other provision of the Constitution of North Carolina prohibits the General Assembly from enacting a statutory method for the removal of district attorneys from office, so long as district attorneys whose removal from office is sought are accorded due process of law. In re Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 404</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 693 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Discovery Not Available.
   
   - District attorney (DA) did not have a right to discovery in a proceeding under this statute since the proceeding was not a civil or criminal proceeding and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C.

       Absolute Immunity Under Defamation Law Did Not Apply.
   
   - District attorney was not entitled to absolute immunity under defamation law for the false, malicious, direct attack on a judge since the proceeding did not seek civil damages, but was a suit to remove the DA from office, to which absolute immunity did not extend. In re Cline, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 11, 749 S.E.2d 91 (2013), review denied <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 293</cite>, 753 S.E.2d 781, 2014 N.C.

       Use of Racial Epithets Is Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice Which Brings the Office into Disrepute.
   
   - There could be no question that the use of racial epithets against a member of the public by a district attorney in an apparent attempt to provoke an affray in public was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the office into disrepute. In re Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 404</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 693 (1997).

       District attorney's abusive verbal attack on African-American man
   
   which gave rise to the inquiry removing him from office was not protected speech under the First Amendment. Instead, when taken in context, his repeated references to victim as a "nigger"presented a classic case of the use of "fighting words" tending to incite an immediate breach of the peace which are not protected by either the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of North Carolina.

       Request for Second Continuance Properly Denied.
   
   - Trial court properly refused to grant a district attorney (DA) a second continuance in a proceeding under this statute because the statute's deadline for holding a hearing was mandatory; the trial court properly postponed the hearing for a week, restricted the scope of the hearing to statements made by the DA, and did not require the DA to present evidence for four days after the start of the hearing.

       Discharge.
   
   - Since an investigatorial assistant's public statements criticizing the district attorney's discretionary decisions and the disruption of his office's working relationship with law enforcement agencies were sufficient reasons, standing alone, to terminate the investigatorial assistant's at will employment, the district attorney's decision to terminate him rested within his lawful and discretionary scope of authority; because the investigatorial assistant's termination was not injurious to the public or against the public good, there was no evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact to support a claim for wrongful discharge against the district attorney.

       Presumption of Adjournment.
   
   - Where the record recited that a regular term of a superior court was opened and held Wednesday, instead of on Monday, of the week fixed by the statutes, it was presumed that the sheriff had duly opened the court and adjourned it from day to day as provided in this section. State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 758</cite>, 10 S.E. 486 (1889).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       All Matters Carried Over.
   
   - This section by operation of law carries all matters over to the next term, in the same plight and condition. State v. Horton, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 695</cite>, 31 S.E. 218 (1898).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Newly Elected Judge.
   
   - Where a newly elected judge, as successor to one who was to have held the spring term of a court, ordered the sheriff to adjourn the court from day to day, not exceeding four days, to enable him to take the oath of office and preside, and the sheriff qualified and held the court, his acts were valid either as those of an officer de jure or as those of an officer de facto, and an exception to the validity of a trial of an action on that ground was untenable. State v. Harden, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 580</cite>, 98 S.E. 782 (1919).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty of Defendant to Attend Special Term.
   
   - A defendant bound over to answer a criminal charge at a regular term of the superior court, which term is not held in consequence of the absence of the judge, is required to attend an intervening special term subsequently appointed and held. State v. Horton, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 695</cite>, 31 S.E. 218 (1898).

       § 7A-97. Court's control of argument.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In all trials in the superior courts there shall be allowed two addresses to the jury for the State or plaintiff and two for the defendant, except in capital felonies, when there shall be no limit as to number. The judges of the superior court are authorized to limit the time of argument of counsel to the jury on the trial of actions, civil and criminal as follows: to not less than one hour on each side in misdemeanors and appeals from justices of the peace; to not less than two hours on each side in all other civil actions and in felonies less than capital; in capital felonies, the time of argument of counsel may not be limited otherwise than by consent, except that the court may limit the number of those who may address the jury to three counsel on each side. Where any greater number of addresses or any extension of time are desired, motion shall be made, and it shall be in the discretion of the judge to allow the same or not, as the interests of justice may require. In jury trials the whole case as well of law as of fact may be argued to the jury.

        Purpose of Section.
   
   - The purpose of this section was not to enlarge the number of addresses but rather to limit the number of counsel and time allowed a defendant's counsel in addressing the jury. State v. McCaskill, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 289, 267 S.E.2d 331, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 101</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 306 (1980).

       <p>
        Application to District Court Proceedings.
   
   - This section would seem to control district court proceedings, when applicable, by virtue of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa18s7A-193" target="_self">G.S. 7A-193</a></cite>, despite the fact that there is no specific reference to this section in that section. Roberson v. Roberson, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 252 S.E.2d 237 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Discretion of Court.
   
   - The trial judge has a large discretion in controlling and directing the argument of counsel, but, under this section, this does not include the right to deprive a litigant of the benefit of his counsel's argument when it is confined within proper bounds and is addressed to the material facts of the case. Puett v. Caldwell &amp; N.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 332</cite>, 53 S.E. 852 (1906); Irvin v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 5</cite>, 80 S.E. 78 (1913); In re Will of Farr, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 172 S.E.2d 78, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 86</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 578 (1970); Kennedy v. Tarlton, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 183 S.E.2d 276 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conduct of counsel in presenting their causes to the jury is left largely to the discretion of the trial judge. In re Will of Farr, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 172 S.E.2d 78, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 86</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 578 (1970); State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975); State v. Cousins, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 540</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 338 (1976); State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 598</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 256 (1977); State v. Penley, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 30</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 783 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The conduct of the arguments of counsel is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 528</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 644 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Arguments of counsel are largely in the control and discretion of the trial judge who must allow wide latitude in the argument of the law, the facts of the case, as well as to all reasonable inferences to be drawn from the facts. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 223</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 359 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial judge is allowed discretion in controlling the arguments before the jury and he may restrict comment on facts not material to the case. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 237 S.E.2d 339 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty to Interfere When Remarks Prejudicial or Unwarranted by Evidence.
   
   - While it is true that in jury trials the whole case as well as of law as of fact may be argued to the jury, and counsel's freedom of argument should not be impaired without good reason, argument is not without limitation. Thus, when the remarks of counsel are not warranted by either the evidence or the law, or are calculated to mislead or prejudice the jury, it is the duty of the judge to interfere. Watson v. White, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 498</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 268 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel's freedom of argument should not be impaired without good reason, but where both the impropriety and the prejudicial effect are clear, the court should act. Wilcox v. Glover Motors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 473</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 76 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the duty of the judge to interfere when the remarks of counsel are not warranted by the evidence and are calculated to mislead or prejudice the jury. State v. Howley, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 113</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 705 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the remarks of counsel are not warranted by either the evidence or the law, or are calculated to mislead or prejudice the jury, it is the duty of the judge to interfere. In re Will of Farr, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 86</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 578 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Because this section presents no mandatory requirement that defendant be allowed to argue his version of the law,
   
   the trial court properly exercised its discretion in preventing the defendant from showing the jury a copy of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-33.2" target="_blank">G.S. 14-33.2</a></cite>, including its effective date, to support his argument that because two of the offenses named in the indictment occurred prior to the enactment of the habitual misdemeanor assault statute, they should not have been considered in determining the issue of his guilt on this charge. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 533 S.E.2d 518 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Limits of Judge's Authority.
   
   - The only manner in which the trial judge is restrained by law with respect to the control over arguments by counsel is found in this section which applies to jury trials in the superior court. Roberson v. Roberson, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 252 S.E.2d 237 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction to Disregard Argument of Law.
   
   - It is the duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury upon the law, and he may correctly tell them to disregard the law as argued to them by counsel. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Rouse Banking Co., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 500</cite>, 132 S.E. 468 (1926).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial judge's violation of the provisions of this section is prejudicial error.
   
   State v. Eury, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 511</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 447 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to charge upon a certain point is reversible error,
   
   especially after counsel has argued the whole case "as well of law as of fact" as is permitted by this section. Nichols v. Champion Fibre Co., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 1</cite>, 128 S.E. 471 (1925).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Grounds for Review of Judge's Discretion.
   
   - Exercise of the trial judge's discretion in controlling jury arguments is not reviewed unless the impropriety of counsel's remarks is extreme and is clearly calculated to prejudice the jury in its deliberations. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 223</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 359 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well settled that the control of the jury arguments of counsel must be left largely to the discretion of the trial court and its rulings thereon will not be disturbed in the absence of gross abuse of discretion. State v. Small, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 556, 230 S.E.2d 425 (1976), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 715</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 207 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The argument of counsel must ordinarily be left to the sound discretion of the judge who tries the case and the appellate court will not review his discretion unless it is apparent that the impropriety of counsel was gross and well calculated to prejudice the jury. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 598</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 256 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In a trial without a jury, argument of counsel is a privilege, not a right,
   
   which is subject to the discretion of the presiding judge. Roberson v. Roberson, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 252 S.E.2d 237 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The implication is clear that the legislature's failure to grant counsel the statutory right to argue to the court in non-jury matters left the authority to refuse to hear arguments within the discretion of the presiding judge. Roberson v. Roberson, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 252 S.E.2d 237 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 8(a)(2) relating to professional malpractice actions
   
   was enacted to reduce the believed impact of pretrial publicity about medical malpractice cases, and for no other purpose. This provision curtails the rights that counsel in this State have long had to argue the facts in evidence and all reasonable inferences drawable therefrom. Biggs v. Cumberland County Hosp. Sys., <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 317 S.E.2d 421 (1984).

        Wide latitude is given counsel
   
   in the exercise of the right to argue to the jury the whole case, as well of law as of fact, but counsel is not entitled to travel outside of the record and argue facts not included in the evidence, and when counsel attempts to do so it is the right and duty of the court to correct the argument, either at the time or in the charge to the jury. State v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 417</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 542 (1947); State v. Graves, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 779</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 770 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel must be allowed wide latitude in the argument of hotly contested cases. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975); State v. Cousins, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 540</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 338 (1976); State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 598</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 256 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel is given wide latitude to argue the facts and all reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom, together with the relevant law, in presenting the case to the jury. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 528</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 644 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsels have a wide latitude in arguing their cases to the jury, and have the right to argue every phase of the case supported by the evidence, and to argue the law as well as the facts. Weeks v. Holsclaw, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 655</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 596, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 273</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 884 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because it is the duty of the prosecuting attorney to present the State's case with earnestness and vigor and to use every legitimate means to bring about a just conviction, in the discharge of that duty he should not be so restricted as to discourage a vigorous presentation of the State's case to the jury. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to argue the whole case has been expressly conferred by statute.
   
   In re Will of Farr, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 172 S.E.2d 78, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 86</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 578 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section counsel's right to argue law generally to the jury has been upheld or expressly recognized. In re Will of Farr, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 172 S.E.2d 78, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 86</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 578 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel May Argue Both Law and Fact.
   
   - Counsel have the right to argue the whole case as well of law as of fact. Brown v. Vestal, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 56</cite>, 55 S.E.2d 797 (1949); In re Will of Farr, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 172 S.E.2d 78, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 86</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 578 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of counsel to state in his argument to the jury what he conceives the law of the case to be has been upheld in numerous decisions. State v. Bovender, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 683</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 323 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel for both sides are entitled to argue to the jury the law and the facts in evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975); Property Shop, Inc. v. Mountain City Inv. Co., <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 290 S.E.2d 222 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel may argue the facts in evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, together with the relevant law, so as to present his case. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 598</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 256 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a basic right of a litigant to have his counsel argue his case to the jury on questions of law and of fact. Board of Transp. v. Wilder, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 105, 220 S.E.2d 183 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to argue "the whole case as well of law as of fact" to the jury arises regardless of whether the trial court's jury instructions will also relate the law on the issue. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 605</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 872 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But counsel may not argue principles of law not relevant to the case.
   
   State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law which this provision allows to be argued must of course be the law applicable to the facts of the case. The whole corpus juris is not fair game. State v. McMorris, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 286</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 553 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not authorize counsel to argue law which is not applicable to the issues, for such arguments could only lead to confusion in the minds of the jury. In re Will of Farr, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 86</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 578 (1970); Fonville v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 193 S.E.2d 406 (1972), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 672</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 152 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        It is reversible error for the trial judge not to permit attorneys to argue law to the jury
   
   and to apply in the argument the decisions of the court as provided by this section. Howard v. Western Union Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 495</cite>, 87 S.E. 313 (1915).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Language may be used consistent with the facts in evidence
   
   to present each side of the case. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel may not "travel outside the record" in his argument
   
   to the jury. State v. Cousins, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 540</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 338 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel may not travel outside the record and place before the jury an incompetent and prejudicial theory of the case grounded wholly on personal beliefs and opinions not supported by the evidence. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 699</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 283 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule is that counsel may argue all the evidence to the jury, which such inferences as may be drawn therefrom; but he may not "travel outside of the record" and inject into his argument facts of his own knowledge or other facts not included in the evidence. State v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 676, 263 S.E.2d 796 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Commenting on Testimony.
   
   - The testimony of a witness being competent, material, and relevant, there can be no doubt of the right of counsel to make proper comment upon it in his address to the jury. In re Will of Farr, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 172 S.E.2d 78, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 86</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 578 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Expression of Counsel's Personal Belief.
   
   - As a general rule, it is improper for the prosecuting attorney to express his personal opinion or belief in the guilt of the accused, unless it is apparent that such opinion is based solely on the evidence, and not on any reasons or information outside the evidence. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 528</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 644 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Incompetent and Prejudicial Matters.
   
   - Counsel may not place before the jury incompetent and prejudicial matters, and may not "travel outside the record" by injecting into his argument facts of his own knowledge or other facts not included in the evidence. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel may not by his argument place before the jury incompetent and prejudicial matter not admissible into evidence. State v. Cousins, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 540</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 338 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        A prosecuting attorney may not place before the jury incompetent and prejudicial matters not admissible in evidence or include in his argument facts not included in the evidence. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 223</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 359 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel may read or state to the jury a statute or other rule of law
   
   relevant to such case, including the statutory provision fixing the punishment for the offense charged. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 256</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 817 (1974); State v. McMorris, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 286</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 553 (1976); State v. Irick, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 480</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 833 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, counsel, in his argument to the jury, is entitled to read or state to the jury a relevant statute or other rule of law so as to present his side of the case. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 299 S.E.2d 680 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But May Not State Law Incorrectly or Read Unconstitutional Statute.
   
   - Counsel may not state the law incorrectly or read to the jury a statutory provision which has been declared unconstitutional. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 256</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 817 (1974); State v. McMorris, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 286</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 553 (1976); State v. Irick, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 480</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 833 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reading and Commenting on Reported Cases.
   
   - As counsel have the right under this section to argue "the whole case as well of law as of fact," they may read to the jury reported cases and comment thereon; but the facts contained in the cases cannot be read as evidence of their existence in another case. Horah v. Knox, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 483</cite> (1882).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section permits counsel, in his argument to the jury, to state his view of the law applicable to the case on trial and to read, in support thereof, from the published reports of decisions of the Supreme Court. It is often necessary for counsel to do so in order that the jury may understand the issue to which counsel's argument on the evidence is addressed. Wilcox v. Glover Motors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 473</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 76 (1967), commented on in 47 N.C.L. Rev. 262 State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 315</cite>, 514 S.E.2d 486 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1006, 120 S. Ct. 503, 145 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1999);.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to make meaningful a statement of a rule of law found in a reported decision, it is sometimes necessary to recount some of the facts which the court had before it when it pronounced the rule in question. For this purpose, counsel, in his argument in a subsequent case, may not only read the rule of law stated in the published opinion in the former case but may also state the facts before the court therein. Wilcox v. Glover Motors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 473</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 76 (1967), commented on in 47 N.C.L. Rev. 262.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not permissible argument for counsel to read, or otherwise state, the facts of another case, together with the decision therein, as premises leading to the conclusion that the jury should return a verdict favorable to his client in the case on trial. This is but an application of the rule that, in his argument to the jury, counsel may not go outside the record and inject into his argument facts of his own knowledge, or other facts not included in the evidence. Wilcox v. Glover Motors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 473</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 76 (1967), commented on in 47 N.C.L. Rev. 262.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ultimate test is whether the reading from the reported case "would reasonably tend to prejudice either party upon the facts" of the case on trial. Wilcox v. Glover Motors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 473</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 76 (1967), commented on in 47 N.C.L. Rev. 262.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section grants counsel the right to argue the law to the jury, which includes the authority to read and comment on reported cases and statutes. There are, however, limitations on what portions of these cases counsel may relate. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 605</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 872 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel's right to argue the law to the jury includes the authority to read and comment on reported cases and statutes. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 315</cite>, 514 S.E.2d 486 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1006, 120 S. Ct. 503, 145 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Facts of Unrelated Case.
   
   - The prosecutor was properly allowed to read the facts of another, unrelated case to the jury during closing arguments, as that portion of the prosecutor's argument not only accurately stated North Carolina law, but also concerned principles of law that were relevant to the issue of burglary in the present case. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 315</cite>, 514 S.E.2d 486 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1006, 120 S. Ct. 503, 145 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel may only read statements of the law in the case which are relevant
   
   to the issues before the jury. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 605</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 872 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reading Facts in Reported Cases.
   
   - Counsel may not read the facts contained in a published opinion together with the result to imply that the jury in his case should return a favorable verdict for his client. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 605</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 872 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reading Excerpts from Treatises in Reported Cases.
   
   - It would be an improper interpretation of this section to allow counsel to avoid the rule prohibiting counsel from reading from medical books or writings of a scientific nature to the jury except when an expert has given an opinion and cited a treatise as his authority on the basis that he read the material from an appellate reporter rather than from the magazine or book itself, especially where it was contained in an opinion that had been reversed by the Supreme Court. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 605</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 872 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reading Reported Cases Discussing Inapplicable Principles of Law.
   
   - Broad and comprehensive as the provisions of this section are, they do not permit counsel to read to the jury decisions discussing principles of law which are irrelevant to the case and have no application to the facts in evidence. State v. Crisp, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 407</cite>, 94 S.E.2d 402 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel May Not Read Mere Dictum or Irrelevant Decisions.
   
   - Although counsel may properly read statements of law and their attendant facts found in the original opinion to the jury, counsel may not read matters which are not law but rather constitute mere dictum and therefore are not within the scope of this section, nor may counsel read to the jury decisions discussing principles of law which are irrelevant to the case and have no application to the facts in evidence. State v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 276</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 641, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 916, 108 S. Ct. 267, 98 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reading Dissenting Opinion as Law of Case.
   
   - It is not permissible for counsel, in his argument to the jury, to read a dissenting opinion by a Justice of the Supreme Court as the law of the case over the defendant's objection, and where this has been done a new trial will be awarded on the defendant's exception thereto. It is the duty of the trial court, either to direct counsel not to read the dissenting opinion or to plainly and unequivocally instruct that the dissenting opinion has no legal bearing upon the case. Conn v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 157</cite>, 159 S.E. 331 (1931); State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 315</cite>, 514 S.E.2d 486 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1006, 120 S. Ct. 503, 145 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel may not read from a dissenting opinion in a reported case. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 605</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 872 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Case Law Desired to Be Read Is Excluded.
   
   - Defendant bears the burden of proving that the erroneous exclusion of case law which defense counsel sought to read to the jury was prejudicial. State v. Harrison, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 629, 369 S.E.2d 624 (1988), overruled on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 402</cite>, 432 S.E.2d 349 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Case Law Improperly Excluded at Trial.
   
   - Where the statement of law read to the jury by defense counsel specifically addressed the State's use of circumstantial evidence to obtain a conviction, had not been reversed on appeal, and was relevant to the issue of circumstantial evidence before the jury in the present case, the trial court improperly excluded the case law at trial. State v. Harrison, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 629, 369 S.E.2d 624 (1988), overruled on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 402</cite>, 432 S.E.2d 349 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Consequences of Nonunanimity.
   
   - Defense counsel is not entitled to argue that trial court will impose a life sentence if the jury cannot reach a unanimous decision; therefore, the trial court properly refused to permit counsel to argue the consequences of nonunanimity. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1990), in light of McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), death sentence vacated, remanded for new capital sentencing proceeding, State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 532</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 577 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibiting the Reading of the Fifth Amendment Held Not Reversible Error.
   
   - The trial court did not commit reversible error in prohibiting the reading to the jury of that portion of the Fifth Amendment pertinent to the defendant's election not to testify, where in his general instructions to the jury, the judge gave an accurate and complete statement of the law applicable to defendant's election not to testify. State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 753</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 398 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defense counsel was entitled to read to the jury that clause of the Fifth Amendment material to defendant's election not to testify,
   
   i.e., "No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself" and to say simply that because of this provision, the jury must not consider defendant's election not to testify adversely to him, or words to this effect. State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 753</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 398 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reading Portions of Final Pleadings.
   
   - The trial court did not commit prejudicial error by allowing counsel for plaintiff to read portions of the final pleadings upon which the case was tried in his argument to the jury. Kennedy v. Tarlton, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 183 S.E.2d 276 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defense counsel may read portions of the final pleadings in his argument to the jury at the discretion of the trial judge. Gillespie v. Draughn, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 283 S.E.2d 548 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 726</cite>, 288 S.E.2d 805 (1982).

         Racially Inflammatory Remarks.
        </b>
        - In a prosecution of three black men, the racially inflammatory remarks in the prosecutor's closing argument before an all-white jury were so prejudicial as to make a fair trial impossible. Miller v. North Carolina, 583 F.2d 701 (4th Cir. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Comment Relating to Dismissed Charge Is Not Relevant.
   
   - Where the case before the jury at the time of counsel's argument consisted of two assault indictments, and a murder charge had been dismissed, comment relating to a possible sentence under that charge was neither relevant nor material to the remaining assault charges before the jury and was not within the protection of this section. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 237 S.E.2d 339 (1977).

        It is proper to argue to jury to compensate at a certain amount per specific time period when there is evidence of continuous pain.

        In a personal injury action, where plaintiff 's evidence tended to show that during the period of time between the accident and trial he suffered pain "almost constantly" as a result of injury caused by the accident, counsel's per diem argument based on this period of time was appropriate. Weeks v. Holsclaw, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 655</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 596, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 273</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 884 (1982).

        Cautionary Instruction Where "Per Diem" Argument Used.
   
   - A "per diem" argument that the jury consider a formula by which a monetary value is assigned to a particular unit of time and this value is multiplied by the total number of such units during which the pain persisted is permissible, but when it is used the trial judge should give appropriate cautionary jury instructions. Weeks v. Holsclaw, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 655</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 596, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 273</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 884 (1982).

While <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa11s7A-97" target="_self">G.S. 7A-97</a></cite> gave counsel wide latitude to argue the facts and all reasonable inferences which might be drawn therefrom, together with the relevant law, in presenting the case to the jury, since the trial court correctly concluded that a mistake of age defense was not a valid defense to taking indecent liberties with a minor, it did not err by preventing defense counsel from arguing the defense to the jury at defendant's trial. State v. Breathette, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 690 S.E.2d 1 (2010).

        Parties May Explain Why Jury Is Being Asked to Consider Aggravating Factors And Their Effect.
   
   - Consistent with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa11s7A-97" target="_self">G.S. 7A-97</a></cite>, parties may explain to a jury the reasons why it is being asked to consider aggravating factors during sentencing and may discuss and illustrate the general effect that finding such factors may have, such as the fact that a finding of an aggravating factor may allow the court to impose a more severe sentence or that the court may find mitigating factors and impose a more lenient sentence. Although a prosecutor's argument discussing of the minimum and maximum sentences was inaccurate and misleading, the error was harmless given the overwhelming proof of the aggravating factor the jury was asked to find. State v. Lopez, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 535</cite>, 681 S.E.2d 271 (Aug. 28, 2009).

        Defendant Has Right to Inform Jury of Punishment.
   
   - This section, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, gives a defendant the right to inform the jury of the punishment that may be imposed upon conviction of the crime for which he is being tried. State v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 521, 235 S.E.2d 906 (1977), aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 311</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 628 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section secures to counsel the right to inform the jury of the punishment prescribed for the offense for which defendant is being tried. Counsel may exercise this right by reading the punishment provisions of the statute to the jury. State v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 311</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 628 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statements in the defense counsel's jury argument which informed the jury of the consequences of a conviction and stated that, in light of those consequences, the jury should give the matter close attention and its most serious consideration were in all respects proper. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 47</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 219 (1977).

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in denying defendant's request to inform the jury during the first phase of the trial that, if convicted, defendant was subject to punishment as a class C felon due to defendant's status as an habitual felon; while defendant had the right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa11s7A-97" target="_self">G.S. 7A-97</a></cite> to inform the jury of the punishment that could be imposed upon conviction of the crime for which defendant was being tried, this did not permit defendant to inform the jury of the maximum sentence as a result of an habitual felon adjudication, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia2As14-7.5" target="_blank">G.S. 14-7.5</a></cite>, providing that an habitual felon trial was to be held separate from the principal felony trial, precluded instruction on the habitual offender penalty. State v. Dammons, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err when it refused to answer the inquiry of the jury regarding the penalty for second-degree murder, as defendant did not choose the exercise the right to inform the jury of the punishment for possible verdicts and the trial court was not obligated to inform the jury of applicable punishments. State v. Hewson, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 196, 642 S.E.2d 459 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 572</cite>, 651 S.E.2d 229 (2007).

        And Is Entitled to New Trial Where Denied This Right.
   
   - A defendant deprived of the right to inform the jury of the punishment that might be imposed upon conviction of the crime for which he was being tried was entitled to a new trial. State v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 521, 235 S.E.2d 906 (1977), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 311</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 628 (1978).

       <p>
        But Not If the Error Is Harmless.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant May Not Attack Validity of Punishment.
   
   - Counsel may not argue the question of punishment in the sense of attacking the validity, constitutionality, or propriety of the prescribed punishment. Nor may counsel argue to the jury that the law ought to be otherwise, that the punishment provided thereby is too severe and, therefore, the jury should find the defendant not guilty of the offense charged but should find him guilty of a lesser offense or acquit him entirely. State v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 311</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 628 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Or Its Severity.
   
   - Where the defense counsel implied in his jury argument that identification of the defendant was based on a fleeting view and that, while such a view may be sufficient to convict in some situations, it was inadequate to convict in the immediate case because the punishment was so severe, thus asking the jury to consider the punishment as part of its substantive deliberations, the trial judge correctly excluded that portion of defendant's jury argument. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 47</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 219 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>

        This section places two restraints on a trial court's ability to limit jury arguments
   
   in capital felonies. First, the statute prohibits the trial court from limiting the number of addresses which can be made to the jury. Second, although the court may limit the number of attorneys who may address the jury to not less than three on each side, the statute prevents the trial court from imposing a limit on the length of the arguments. State v. Gladden, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 398</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 673, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 871, 107 S. Ct. 241, 93 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1986).

        Argument as to Jury's Role in Sentencing Phase of Capital Trial.
   
   - In the sentencing phase of a bifurcated trial, a reference to any statutory provision, which would have the effect of minimizing in the jurors' minds their role in recommending the sentence to be imposed, is precluded. The matters which a jury may consider in the sentencing phase of a bifurcated trial are clearly set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXVa100s15A-2000ol1e" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-2000(e)</a></cite> and (f). State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 495</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 425 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Argument as to Review by Supreme Court in Capital Cases.
   
   - During the sentencing phase of a bifurcated prosecution for murder, it was error for the district attorney to read to the jury <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXVa100s15A-2000ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-2000(d)</a></cite>, relating to the review of judgment and sentence by the Supreme Court. A reference to appellate review has no relevance with regard to the jury's task of weighing any aggravating and mitigating circumstances for the purpose of recommending a sentence. More importantly, such reference will, in all likelihood, result in the jury's reliance on the Supreme Court for the ultimate determination of sentence. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 495</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 425 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule precluding any argument which suggests to the jurors that they can depend on judicial or executive review to correct an erroneous verdict and thereby lessen the jurors' responsibility applies with equal force to a sentence recommendation in a bifurcated trial. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 495</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 425 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reference to Parole Statute.
   
   - In a prosecution for murder, during the sentencing phase of a bifurcated trial, the district attorney's reference to the parole statute was erroneous. Neither the State nor the defendant should be allowed to speculate upon the outcome of possible appeals, paroles, executive commutations or pardons. The jury's sentence recommendation should be based solely on their balancing of the aggravating and mitigating factors before them. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 495</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 425 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the word "parole" was never used, and there was no specific mention of the possibility that a life sentence could mean release in 20 years, the district attorney's arguments did not suggest the possibility of parole in so direct a manner as to amount to a gross impropriety requiring ex mero motu intervention by the trial court. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 407</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 400 (1988), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1022, 110 S. Ct. 1464, 108 L.

        In defendant's trial on charges of first-degree murder and robbery with a firearm, the trial court properly advised the jury that life imprisonment meant a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, and the state supreme court rejected the argument that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.084.html#t84a03s84-14" target="_blank">G.S. 84-14</a></cite> (recodified as this section) gave defendant the right to inform the jury of the punishment that could be imposed if defendant was convicted.

        Final Closing Argument Where Defendant Presents Evidence.
   
   - This section means that although the trial court in a capital case may limit to three the number of counsel on each side who may address the jury, those three (or however many actually argue) may argue for as long as they wish, and each may address the jury as many times as he desires. However, if defendant presents evidence, all such addresses must be made prior to the prosecution's closing argument. State v. Gladden, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 398</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 673, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 871, 107 S. Ct. 241, 93 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant in a capital case presented evidence, the State had the right to give the final closing argument pursuant to Rule 10 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts. This section did not give defendant the right to respond to the State's argument. State v. Gladden, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 398</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 673, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 871, 107 S.

        Quotations from the Bible.
   
   - District attorney's closing remarks at the penalty phase, in which he read quotations from the Bible, were not so improper as to require intervention by the trial court ex mero motu. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 407</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 400 (1988), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1022, 110 S. Ct. 1464, 108 L.

       <p>
        Evidence supported district attorney's reference to defendant as a "professional assassin"
   
   in attorney's argument at the guilt phase, and defendant failed to object to the statement; therefore, the trial court did not err in failing to intervene ex mero motu to correct this remark. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 407</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 400 (1988), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1022, 110 S. Ct. 1464, 108 L.

        Refusal to Allow Both Defense Counsel to Argue Was Prejudicial Error.
   
   - At the conclusion of the sentencing proceeding in capital murder case, the trial court erred in refusing to permit both counsel for defendant to address the jury during defendant's final argument. This deprived the defendant of a substantial right and amounted to prejudicial error. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 313</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 332 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 963, 108 S. Ct. 1230, 99 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's refusal in a capital case to permit both counsel to address the jury during defendant's final arguments constituted prejudicial error per se in both the guilt-innocence and sentencing phases, entitling defendant to a new trial. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 650</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 554 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure of trial court to permit defense counsel to make three arguments during closing arguments of the guilt phase, an opening argument by one defense attorney before the State's closing arguments and two final arguments, one by each of his attorneys, after the State's closing arguments, where defendant was being tried for multiple capital felonies and did not present evidence during the guilt-innocence phase, and where counsel made a clear request,
   constituted prejudicial error per se and entitled the defendant to a new trial as to both capital and noncapital charges. State v. Barrow, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 640</cite>, 517 S.E.2d 374 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        How Often and How Long Defense Attorneys May Address Jury.
   
   - In capital cases this section allows the trial court to limit defendant to three counsel, but at each point at which defendant has the right to present an argument to the jury those three, or however many actually argue, may argue for as long as they wish, and each may address the jury as many times as he desires. Thus, for example, if one defense attorney grows weary of arguing, he may allow another defense attorney to address the jury, and may, upon being refreshed, rise again to make another address during defendant's time for argument. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 650</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 554 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant is entitled to the final or last jury argument, during the closing arguments in a capital case, his attorneys may each address the jury as many times as they desire during the closing phase of the arguments. The only limit to this right is the provision of this section allowing the trial judge to limit to three the number of counsel on each side who may address the jury. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 650</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 554 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In cases in which a capital felony has been joined for trial with noncapital charges,
   
   the failure of the trial judge to allow both of defendant's counsel to make the closing argument is prejudicial error in the noncapital as well as the capital charges. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 650</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 554 (1988).

        Duty of Court to Censor Remarks.
   
   - The trial court has a duty, upon objection, to censor remarks not warranted by either the evidence or the law, or remarks calculated to mislead or prejudice the jury. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975); State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 699</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 283 (1975); State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 598</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 256 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court is required, upon objection, to censor remarks either not warranted by the law or facts or made only to prejudice or mislead the jury. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 528</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 644 (1977); State v. Ford, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 466</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 420 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court has a duty, upon objection, to censure remarks which are not warranted by the law or evidence or are calculated to mislead or prejudice the jury, and, if the impropriety is gross, it is proper for the trial judge, even in the absence of objection, to correct the abuse ex mero motu. Watson v. White, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 498</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 268 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If the impropriety in counsel's closing arguments is gross,
   
   it is proper for the court even in the absence of objection, to correct the abuse ex mero motu. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975); State v.

        Failure to Sustain Objection to Remark with No Basis in Law or Fact.
   
   - A trial court errs as a matter of law in failing to sustain plaintiff 's objection to the remarks of defendant's counsel, which remarks had no basis in law or fact, but rather injected extraneous considerations concerning defendants' financial situation so far as their capacity to respond to damages was concerned. Watson v. White, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 498</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 268 (1983).

        An objection to argument of counsel must be made at the time of the argument,
   
   so as to give the court an opportunity to correct the transgression, if any. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 431</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 217 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>

        Or Before Verdict.
   
   - Exception to improper remarks of counsel during argument must be taken before verdict. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 431</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 217 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, an objection to the arguments by counsel must be made before verdict, since only when the impropriety is gross is the trial court required to correct the abuse ex mero motu. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 528</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 644 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Or Else Waived.
   
   - Objection to an impropriety in counsel's argument to the jury is waived by waiting until after the verdict to enter the objection. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 431</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 217 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        After verdict, an objection to an impropriety in the argument comes too late. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 598</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 256 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Capital Case Exception.
   
   - An exception to the general rule that objections to counsel's argument to the jury must be made before verdict is recognized in capital cases where the improper argument was so prejudicial in nature that, in the opinion of the court, no instruction by the trial court could have removed it from the minds of the jury had the objection been seasonably made. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 431</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 217 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the capital case exception the first attention of the reviewing court is to consider if the challenged argument was improper and, if so, whether it was improper to the extent that doubt remains as to whether a curative instruction would remove its prejudicial effect. If a convicted defendant was so prejudiced, the failure to object is no bar and his claim may be decided on the merits. If, on the other hand, it can be said that the argument was not prejudicial or that a curative instruction would have removed any prejudice, his failure to object to the argument is treated as a bar to appellate relief. Miller v. North Carolina, 583 F.2d 701 (4th Cir. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        If argument of counsel in a capital case is so grossly improper that removal of its prejudicial effect, after a curative instruction, remains in doubt, the general rule requiring objection before verdict does not apply. Miller v. North Carolina, 583 F.2d 701 (4th Cir. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Application of the capital case exception entails an inquiry by the reviewing court into the merits of the claim; waiver is not automatic. Miller v. North Carolina, 583 F.2d 701 (4th Cir. 1978).

        The right to closing argument is a substantial legal right
   
   of which a defendant may not be deprived by the exercise of a judge's discretion. State v. Eury, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 511</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 447 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If, in a non-capital case, defendant elects to present evidence, he is entitled to open the argument
   
   to the jury before the prosecution argues, and two of his counsel may address the jury within the time limits prescribed by this section. State v. Eury, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 511</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 447 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If defendant in a non-capital case does not present evidence, he is entitled to both open and close
   
   the argument to the jury. In such case he may have one lawyer make the opening argument and one the closing, or he may waive one argument and have both lawyers address the jury during the remaining argument. State v. Eury, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 511</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 447 (1986).
   <br />

       <p>
        Where defendant by stipulation waived her opening argument,
   
   the failure of the trial judge to allow both of defendant's counsel to make the closing argument was prejudicial error in the non-capital as well as the capital charges against her. State v. Eury, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 511</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 447 (1986).

       The numbers and salaries of assistant clerks, deputy clerks, and other employees in the office of each clerk of superior court shall be determined by the Administrative Officer of the Courts after consultation with the clerk concerned. However, no office of clerk of superior court shall have fewer than five total staff positions in addition to the elected clerk of superior court. All personnel in the clerk's office are employees of the State. The clerk appoints the assistants, deputies, and other employees in the clerk's office to serve at his or her pleasure. Assistant and deputy clerks shall take the oath of office prescribed for clerks of superior court, conformed to the office of assistant or deputy clerk, as the case may be. Except as provided by subsection (c2) of this section, the job classifications and related salaries of each employee within the office of each superior court clerk shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Officer of the Courts after consultation with each clerk concerned and shall be subject to the availability of funds appropriated for that purpose by the General Assembly.

       An assistant clerk is authorized to perform all the duties and functions of the office of clerk of superior court, and any act of an assistant clerk is entitled to the same faith and credit as that of the clerk. A deputy clerk is authorized to certify the existence and correctness of any record in the clerk's office, to take the proofs and examinations of the witnesses touching the execution of a will as required by G.S. 31-17, and to perform any other ministerial act which the clerk may be authorized and empowered to do, in his own name and without reciting the name of his principal. The clerk is responsible for the acts of his assistants and deputies. With the consent of the clerk of superior court of each county and the consent of the presiding judge in any proceeding, an assistant or deputy clerk is authorized to perform all the duties and functions of the office of the clerk of superior court in another county in any proceeding in the district or superior court that has been transferred to that county from the county in which the assistant or deputy clerk is employed.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIIa12s7A-102ol1c">
       Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the Administrative Officer of the Courts shall establish an incremental salary plan for assistant clerks and for deputy clerks based on a series of salary steps corresponding to the steps contained in the Salary Plan for State Employees adopted by the Office of State Human Resources, subject to a minimum and a maximum annual salary as set forth below. On and after July 1, 1985, each assistant clerk and each deputy clerk shall be eligible for an annual step increase in his salary plan based on satisfactory job performance as determined by each clerk. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an assistant or deputy clerk's years of service in the office of superior court clerk would warrant an annual salary greater than the salary first established under this section, that assistant or deputy clerk shall be eligible on and after July 1, 1984, for an annual step increase in his salary plan. Furthermore, on and after July 1, 1985, that assistant or deputy clerk shall be eligible for an increase of two steps in his salary plan, and shall remain eligible for a two-step increase each year as recommended by each clerk until that assistant or deputy clerk's annual salary corresponds to his number of years of service. Any person covered by this subsection who would not receive a step increase in fiscal year 1995-96 because that person is at the top of the salary range as it existed for fiscal year 1994-95 shall receive a salary increase to the maximum annual salary provided by subsection (c1) of this section.

      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIIIa12s7A-102ol1-c2">
       The clerk of superior court may appoint assistant clerks, deputy clerks, and a head bookkeeper and set their salaries above the minimum rate established for the positions by subsection (c1) of this section if, in the clerk's discretion, (i) the needs of the clerk's office would be best served by an appointment above the minimum rate, (ii) the appointee's skills and experience support the higher rate, and (iii) the Administrative Office of the Courts certifies that there are sufficient funds available.

   Russ v. Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 36</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 351 (1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Such court has only such jurisdiction as is given by statute. It has no common-law or equitable jurisdiction. McCauley v. McCauley, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 288</cite>, 30 S.E. 344 (1898).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Powers of Clerk Within His Jurisdiction.
   
   - Within his jurisdiction the clerk of the superior court has the same power as courts of general jurisdiction to open, vacate, modify, set aside or enter as of a former time, decrees or orders of his court, and to fix time for hearings. Russ v. Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 36</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 351 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The clerk has the jurisdiction to correct a mistake in a partition proceeding.
   
   Wahab v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 229</cite> (1880); Little v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 84</cite>, 62 S.E. 770 (1908).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Power to Set Aside Sale.
   
   - In a proceeding to subject real estate to sale for assets, after a report of the sale is returned and confirmed, the clerk has the right to set aside the sale and order a resale by showing proper cause. Lovinier v. Pearce, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. 167</cite> (1874).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Correction of Omissions.
   
   - The power of a court upon a proper showing to correct its records and supply an inadvertent omission cannot be doubted. Philbrick v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 737</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 725 (1961).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Clerk May Correct Orders Entered Erroneously.
   
   - The broad grant of power to the clerk in this section includes the power to correct orders entered erroneously, whenever the clerk's attention is directed to the error by motion or by other means. In re Estate of English, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 359, 350 S.E.2d 379 (1986), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 403</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 711 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The clerk of the superior court is authorized to correct, nunc pro tunc, orders
   
   entered on erroneous misapprehension of the facts. In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 318 S.E.2d 544 (1984), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 330</cite>, 327 S.E.2d 900 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Removal of Administrators.
   
   - The clerk has the power, for good and sufficient cause, to remove an administrator, or for like cause, as necessarily equivalent, to permit him to resign his trust. Murrill v. Sandlin, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 54</cite> (1882); Tulburt v. Hollar, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 406</cite>, 9 S.E. 430 (1889).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appointment and Replacement of Trustees
   
   - Action filed by a trust beneficiary and a settlor's siblings, pursuant to G.S. 36A-125.4, seeking an order modifying a trust, was really an action seeking replacement of the trustee for exercising discretion in managing the trust and the trial court's judgment dismissing the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was upheld. In re Testamentary Trust of Charnock, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 35, 579 S.E.2d 887 (2003), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 523</cite>, 597 S.E.2d 706 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem.
   
   - Where the clerk, upon his own motion, sought to have the administratrix of the estate removed, and the minor heirs clearly had a vested interest and the right of appeal from the clerk's determination, the clerk took the appropriate and proper step of appointing a guardian ad litem to protect their interests and the clerk could compel the payment of the necessary expenses from the estate to which the heirs would potentially benefit, including the costs of the guardian ad litem's attorneys' fees, to the estate. In re Estate of Sturman, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 378 S.E.2d 204 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Examination of Accounts.
   
   - The jurisdiction for auditing accounts of executors, administrators, etc., conferred upon the clerk is an ex parte jurisdiction of examining the accounts and vouchers of such persons, allowing them commissions, etc., as formerly practiced, and does not conclude legatees, etc., or affect suits inter partes upon the same matters. Heilig v. Foard, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 710</cite> (1870).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Clerk Had Jurisdiction to Deny Accounting.
   
   - The clerk had jurisdiction to grant or deny plaintiffs' Motion to Compel an Accounting, because this section grants the clerk of superior court jurisdiction to audit the accounts of fiduciaries, as required by law, and by implication, to deny a request to audit such accounts as well. Wilson v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 500, 524 S.E.2d 812 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Probate of Wills.
   
   - This section confers upon the clerk of the superior court exclusive and original jurisdiction of proceedings for the probate of wills. Brissie v. Craig, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 701</cite>, 62 S.E.2d 330 (1950); Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 30</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 110 (1956).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The clerk had authority to rehear a petition to reopen an estate and to reverse her prior order
   
   that the estate be reopened. In re Estate of English, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 359, 350 S.E.2d 379 (1986), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 403</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 711 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts of Heirs Would Not Affect Clerk's Determination.
   
   - The clerk of court was not bound, in making a discretionary determination of whether "proper cause" existed for reopening an estate, by any estoppel theory based upon acts of the heirs. In re Estate of English, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 359, 350 S.E.2d 379 (1986), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 403</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 711 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal to Reopen Estate Upheld.
   
   - In light of the public policy in favor of the expedited administration of estates, as evidenced by the six-month statute of limitations and other provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 28A</a></cite>, petitioner, who alleged that the deceased had promised to devise a life estate to her, had a heavy burden of justifying her failure to bring her suit within the six-month period provided for that purpose, or at the very least, within the greater than two-year period that the estate actually remained open. There was no error in the clerk's determination that this burden was not met. In re Estate of English, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 359, 350 S.E.2d 379 (1986), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 403</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 711 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the subpoena duces tecum is to require the production of specific items
   
   patently material to the inquiry. Therefore, it must specify with as much precision as fair and feasible the particular items desired. State v. Newell, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 707, 348 S.E.2d 158 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Issuance of Subpoena Duces Tecum.
   
   - It is the long-established practice of clerks of court to issue subpoenas duces tecum as a matter of course upon the oral request of counsel. The issuance of the subpoena is treated merely as a ministerial act which initiates proceedings to have the documents or other items described in the subpoena brought before the court. At the trial, the court will pass upon the competency of the evidence unless the subpoena has been quashed prior thereto. Vaughan v. Broadfoot, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 691</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 37 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Customary Use of Subpoena Duces Tecum.
   
   - Attorneys have customarily used the subpoena duces tecum only for the purpose for which it was intended, i.e., to require the production of a specific document or items patently material to the inquiry, or as a notice to produce the original of a document. Vaughan v. Broadfoot, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 691</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 37 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Discovery is not a proper purpose for a subpoena duces tecum.
   
   State v. Newell, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 707, 348 S.E.2d 158 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Documents Are Subject to Subpoena Duces Tecum.
   
   - Documents not subject to the criminal discovery statute, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIXa48s15A-903" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-903</a></cite>, may still be subject to a subpoena duces tecum. State v. Newell, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 707, 348 S.E.2d 158 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A motion to quash a subpoena duces tecum is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge,
   
   and is not subject to review absent a showing of abuse of discretion. State v. Newell, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 707, 348 S.E.2d 158 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in quashing subpoena duces tecum
   
   which called for all files and records of children's home relating to the victim and another witness in a prosecution for taking indecent liberties with a child. State v. Newell, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 707, 348 S.E.2d 158 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A reasonable fee for legal advice and assistance in the management of a trust estate is allowable
   
   as a necessary expense of the trust estate. Tripp v. Tripp, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 64, 193 S.E.2d 366 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Partial Payment Allocated to Principal First.
   
   - When payment is made on a debt which has accumulated interest but the payment is not high enough to satisfy the principal and interest, in order to encourage debtors to pay the entire amount due and in the interest of fairness, when payments are made on a judgment debt, the clerk should first allocate the payment to the interest due, and the remainder of the payment should be allocated to the principal. Morley v. Morley, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 713, 403 S.E.2d 574 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeals.
   
   - In appeals from the clerk, in that class of cases of which he has jurisdiction in his capacity as clerk, as given under this section, it is not necessary that he should prepare and transmit to the judge any statement of the case on appeal. Ex parte Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. 271</cite> (1886).
   <br />

         If clerk or the clerk's spouse is named as executor or trustee in any testamentary or other paper, but this disqualification ceases when the will or other paper is finally admitted to probate by another clerk, or before the judge of the superior court.

       The proper practice, in a proceeding against an administrator who at the time was elected clerk,
   
   seems to be to make the summons returnable before him, and then transfer the whole proceeding before the district judge, who will make the necessary orders in the premises. Wilson v. Abrams, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. 324</cite> (1874).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Disqualification of Interested Clerk.
   
   - The clerk is disqualified, both by common-law rules and by this section, to act in any cause wherein he is interested. Gregory v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 225</cite> (1880); White v. Connelly, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 65</cite>, 11 S.E. 177 (1890); Scranton &amp; N.C. Land &amp; Lumber Co. v. Jennett, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 3</cite>, 37 S.E. 954 (1901).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       And where he is personally interested in the commissions
   
   to be allowed the executors, the clerk is excluded from jurisdiction. Barlow v. Norfleet, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 535</cite> (1875).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The probate of a deed by a clerk interested therein is a nullity.
   
   Scranton &amp; N.C. Land &amp; Lumber Co. v. Jennett, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 3</cite>, 37 S.E. 954 (1901).
      </p>
      <p>
       And when the probate of a deed is a nullity because the clerk was disqualified to act the defect is not cured by the approval of the final decree, under which it is made, by the judge of the superior court. Scranton &amp; N.C. Land &amp; Lumber Co. v. Jennett, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 3</cite>, 37 S.E. 954 (1901).
      </p>
      <p>
       The act of "admitting to probate" is a judicial act, and a clerk is prohibited from acting on a deed or deed of trust in which he is grantor or grantee. White v. Connelly, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 65</cite>, 11 S.E. 177 (1890); Freeman v. Person, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 251</cite>, 10 S.E. 1037 (1890); Piland v.

       Performance of Ministerial Acts.
   
   - The issuing of a warrant in attachment, or an order for seizure of property in claim and delivery, are ministerial acts, and can be performed by a deputy, or even by the clerk, in a case to which he is a party. Evans v. Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. 42</cite>, 1 S.E. 633 (1887); White v. Connelly, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 65</cite>, 11 S.E. 177 (1890).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Issuance of Process.
   
   - It has been the practice in this State for clerks to issue process either for or against themselves. Evans v. Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. 42</cite>, 1 S.E. 633 (1887).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A clerk cannot take proof of a deed of which he is the subscribing witness,
   
   because he cannot administer an oath to himself. Trenwith v. Smallwood, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 132</cite>, 15 S.E. 1030 (1892).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Relationship of Clerk to Party.
   
   - A clerk is prohibited from acting as such in relation to any estate or proceeding if he is so related to any person having, or claiming to have, such interest that he would by reason of such relationship be disqualified as a juror. Scranton &amp; N.C. Land &amp; Lumber Co. v. Jennett, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 3</cite>, 37 S.E. 954 (1901).
      </p>
      <p>
       But probate and private examination taken before an officer are not invalid simply because the clerk is related to the parties. McAllister v. Purcell, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 262</cite>, 32 S.E. 715 (1899).

   - Where beneficiaries' filings only requested an order removing the trustee of trusts, the trial court did not err by exercising jurisdiction or entering orders regarding the trustee's removal after the clerk recused himself from the case; the trial court provided the parties with due process, and its conclusions removing the trustee were supported by its findings of fact.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Necessity of Order and Demand on Predecessor.
   
   - A person duly elected clerk of the superior court by the people needs no order from any person or authority to demand from his predecessor the property of all kinds belonging to the office, nor is it necessary for a retiring superior court clerk to be ordered to pay over to his successor, whether elected or appointed, the funds, etc., of the officer. But where the judge places some person temporarily in charge of the office until the regular appointment is made, it is then necessary for the new clerk to have an order from the judge directing the person temporarily in charge to deliver the possession of his office to such clerk. Peebles v. Boone, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 57</cite>, 21 S.E. 187 (1895).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Ground for Right of Action.
   
   - The right of clerk of a superior court to bring an action against his predecessor on the latter's official bond to recover the records, money, etc., in his hands does not rest on any injury done to the plaintiff, but on the ground that the law requires that each successive clerk shall receive from his predecessor all the records, money and property of his office. Peebles v. Boone, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 57</cite>, 21 S.E. 187 (1895).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Two Distinct Remedies Provided.
   
   - Our statutes provide two separate and distinct remedies - one in behalf of the injured individual for a specific fund to which he is entitled or on account of a particular wrong committed against him by the clerk, as provided for in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.058.html#t58a76s58-76-5" target="_blank">G.S. 58-76-5</a></cite>, and one in behalf of the clerk against his predecessor in office to recover possession of records, books, papers, and money in the hands of the outgoing clerk by virtue or under color of his office, as provided for in this section. State ex rel. Underwood v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 437</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 144 (1943); State ex rel. Underwood v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 502</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 465 (1944).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Successor's Remedy.
   
   - When an outgoing clerk fails to deliver the property of his office, as herein provided, the successor's remedy is by attachment and suit for the penalty. O'Leary v. Harrison, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. 338</cite> (1859).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Affirmative Allegations Improperly Stricken.
   
   - In an action by the clerk of the superior court against his predecessor in office for possession of records, books and funds under this section, where defendant denied the allegations of the complaint that plaintiff was duly appointed clerk to fill a vacancy caused by the removal of defendant and qualified as such, and also made further affirmative allegations to like effect, there was error in allowing a motion to strike such affirmative allegations. State ex rel. Underwood v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 437</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 144 (1943).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Liability Ceases.
   
   - When a former clerk delivers to his successors all the proceeds, etc., of his office, his official duties, powers, and liabilities cease. Gregory v. Morisey, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. 559</cite> (1878).

       Construction.
   
   - While the Public Records Act applies generally to state government records, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa12s7A-109" target="_self">G.S. 7A-109</a></cite> is specifically limited to court records; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa12s7A-109" target="_self">G.S. 7A-109</a></cite>(d), addressing "remote electronic access" to court records, is a more specific statute that overrides applicability of the Public Records Act. LexisNexis Risk Data Mgmt. v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 180</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 651 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       While subsection (a) applies to court records in general, later-added subsection (d) focuses narrowly on court records maintained in electronic form; accordingly, the General Assembly intended that the non-exclusive contracts authorized in subsection (d) be the sole means of remote electronic access to the Automated Criminal/Infraction System. LexisNexis Risk Data Mgmt. v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 180</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 651 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Access to the public information maintained in the Automated Criminal/Infraction System remains fully available by obtaining the physical records from the appropriate clerk of court, through the "green screen" terminal maintained in the local courthouse, or by means of a contract with the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts for remote access. LexisNexis Risk Data Mgmt. v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 180</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 651 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Section Held Inapplicable to Prevent Introduction of Parole Evidence.
   
   - In an action to remove the executor of an estate, this section would not apply to prevent defendant from introducing parole evidence to prove that the court clerk gave oral approval of executor's actions and authorized commissions to be paid executor. Matthews v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 640, 373 S.E.2d 133 (1988), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 541</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 857 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of Recordkeeping.
   
   - The clerk's proceedings are summary in their nature, and should always be put in such shape as to present all that he does in the course of a proceeding, including his orders and judgments, intelligently, and so that the same may be distinctly seen and understood. To this end, the clerk is required to keep certain permanent records of proceedings before him. Edwards v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. 4</cite> (1886).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment Docket Serves as Notice.
   
   - The law prescribes what shall be recorded on the judgment docket, and everybody has notice that he may find there whatever ought to be there recorded, if indeed it exists. He is not required to look elsewhere for such matters. But he is required and bound to take notice in proper connections of what is there. The law charges him with such notice. Holman v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. 118</cite>, 9 S.E. 429 (1889); Dewey v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 328</cite>, 13 S.E. 923 (1891).

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Civil Issue Docket.
   
   - Not only issues of fact joined upon the pleadings, but also all other matters for hearing before the judge at a regular term of the court are to be put upon the civil issue docket. Brown v. Rhinehart, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 772</cite>, 16 S.E. 840 (1893). See Brittain v. Mull, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 498</cite> (1884); Walton v. Pearson, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 428</cite>, 7 S.E. 566 (1888).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Minute Docket.
   
   - The minute docket is intended to and should contain a record of all the proceedings of the court, and such other entries as the judge may direct to be therein made. Walton v. Pearson, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 428</cite>, 7 S.E. 566 (1888); Guilford v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 23</cite>, 27 S.E. 94 (1897).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Minute Docket Prevails.
   
   - While in the absence of entries on the minute docket those made on the civil issue docket should not be disregarded, yet where there is a conflict between them, nothing else appearing, those on the former must prevail. Walton v. Pearson, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 428</cite>, 7 S.E. 566 (1888).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Record of Fiats.
   
   - Clerks are required to record in general order books copies of all fiats made by them. Perry v. Bragg, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 159</cite>, 16 S.E. 10 (1892).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Record of Appointments.
   
   - The record of appointments is admissible as evidence to show a guardian's appointment. Topping v. Windley, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. 4</cite>, 5 S.E. 14 (1888).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient Notice of Lien.
   
   - A notice of a lien filed on the lien docket should go into details sufficiently so as to give reasonable notice to all persons of the character of the claim and the property upon which the lien is attached. Fulp &amp; Linville v. Kernersville Light &amp; Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 157</cite>, 72 S.E. 867 (1911). See Cook v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 68</cite>, 7 S.E. 700 (1888); Cameron v. Consolidated Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 266</cite>, 24 S.E. 7 (1896).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Former G.S. 2-42 did not require cross-indexing of liens filed in the clerk's office
   
   and was not to be confused with the requirements for registering liens, deeds, etc., in the office of the register of deeds as provided by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.161.html#t161a02s161-22" target="_blank">G.S. 161-22</a></cite>, which does require cross-indexing. Saunders v. Woodhouse, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 608</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 701 (1956).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A lien for material and labor
   
   was properly filed where the clerk after delivery attached it in its original form to specified page in a book labeled "Lien Docket," where the book without question was the book intended as the lien docket contemplated by former G.S. 2-42, though the book was also used for the filing of liens for old age assistance, since former G.S. 108-30.1 provided that such liens should be filed in the regular lien docket. Saunders v. Woodhouse, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 608</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 701 (1956).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of the clerk to comply with the statute by neglecting to record all or a part of the proceeding
   
   does not render the proceeding void. Any interested party may, by motion, require the proceeding to be recorded, and when a part of the papers has been lost without being recorded, the proceeding does not, because of that fact, lose its vitality or cease to give the protection which the complete record would afford. State Trust Co. v. Toms, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 645</cite>, 94 S.E.2d 806 (1956).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant county clerk was not required to comply
   
   with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Va11s1-116" target="_blank">G.S. 1-116</a></cite>, 1-117, and 7A-109(b)(6) where the plaintiff was not entitled to have her notice of lis pendens cross-indexed by him on the public record. George v. Administrative Office of the Courts, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 542 S.E.2d 699 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Treasurer's Report as Evidence.
   
   - The record of the county treasurer's report is competent evidence against the sureties upon the official bond of such officer, and is prima facie evidence of the correctness of statements therein made. Davenport v. McKee, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 500</cite>, 4 S.E. 545 (1887).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Recording of Verified Report Purports Verity.
   
   - Plaintiff, purchaser of the real property at execution sale of a judgment against the devisee, offered in evidence, as proof of payment and that title had vested in the devisee, a special report, duly verified, filed by the executrix, stating that the devisee had paid the estate the amount stipulated by the will. This special, verified report of the executrix was a document authorized and required to be recorded, was relevant to the issue, and was competent in evidence, its recording purporting verity, and objection to its admission on the ground of hearsay in that it contained a declaration of a person not a party to the action was untenable, the recorded, verified report being more than a mere declaration by the executrix. Braddy v. Pfaff, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 248</cite>, 186 S.E. 340 (1936).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Request of Copy of Database.
   
   - Trial court erred in concluding that requiring the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) to provide a copy of the Automated Criminal/Infraction System (ACIS) database upon request would negate the provisions of subsection (d) because a company was not seeking remote electronic access to ACIS but requested a copy of the entire database; subsection (d) is expressly permissive, rather than mandatory. LexisNexis Risk Data Mgmt. v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 754 S.E.2d 223 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals erred by concluding that the Public Records Act provided the legal basis for granting corporations' request for a copy of the Automated Criminal/Infraction System database and that <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa12s7A-109" target="_self">G.S. 7A-109</a></cite> was inapposite to an analysis of access to such records because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa12s7A-109" target="_self">G.S. 7A-109</a></cite> controlled the request for the records. LexisNexis Risk Data Mgmt. v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 180</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 651 (2015).

The numbers and boundaries of the districts are as provided by G.S. 7A-133. The district court shall sit in the county seat of each county, and at such additional places in each county as the General Assembly may authorize, except that sessions of court are not required at an additional seat of court unless the chief district judge and the Administrative Officer of the Courts concur in a finding that the facilities are adequate.

        Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, when exigent circumstances exist within a judicial district, sessions of district court may be conducted at a location outside a county seat by order of the chief district court judge of a county, with the prior approval of the location and facilities by the Administrative Officer of the Courts and after consultation with the clerk of superior court and county officials of the county. An order entered under this subsection shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county and posted at the courthouse within the county seat and notice shall be posted in other conspicuous locations.

      - Session Laws 2017-214, s. 4(a), eliminated party primary elections for candidates for Justice of the Supreme Court, Judges of the Court of Appeals, superior court judges, and district court judges, for the November 6, 2018, general election, and s. 4(b)-(k) of that act provides for notices of candidacy, requirements, a timeline, filing fees, and method of determining the winner of each race. For full text of Session Laws 2017-214, s. 4(a)-(k), see note at G.S. 163A-970.

     <p>
      Session Laws 2018-3, s. 2(a)-(d), as amended by Session Laws 2018-130, ss. 2, 3, provides: "The General Assembly finds that both chambers of the General Assembly have carefully examined judicial redistricting and the forms of judicial selection with multiple committees considering various proposals of selection and new judicial district maps. The General Assembly finds that, to allow for more time to thoughtfully consider these changes, the General Assembly enacted S.L. 2017-214, the Electoral Freedom Act of 2017, which, among other items, provided for a one-time cancellation of partisan primaries for the offices of district court judge, superior court judge, judges of the Court of Appeals, and Supreme Court justices for the 2018 election cycle. The General Assembly finds that all elections for judges in 2018 were to be treated uniformly under S.L. 2017-214, the Electoral Freedom Act of 2017, while those changes were considered.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The General Assembly notes that election to these offices will be held under a plurality election system, with candidates running under a political party label on the ballot, without having gone through a party primary. The General Assembly finds that ballot language above the sections of election ballots regarding these impacted offices setting forth that the listed party affiliation is only the self-identified party of a candidate at the time of filing will aid voters' understanding of the 2018 judicial races.

      "(1) Justices of the Supreme Court.

       Purpose of Section.
   
   - Legislative anticipation of the procedural quagmires and "judge shopping" that could result from multi-judge districts was a factor prompting the enactment of this section. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 310, 172 S.E.2d 264 (1970).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority of Judge Other Than Chief District Judge to Hear Motions and Enter Interlocutory Orders.
   
   - Under the provisions of the first portion of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa18s7A-192" target="_self">G.S. 7A-192</a></cite>, before a district court judge, other than the chief district judge, may hear motions and enter interlocutory orders at any session of district court in cases calendared for trial or hearing at such session, he must be first assigned by the chief district judge under the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section to preside at such session. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to have authority to act on any motion, a district judge, other than the chief district judge, must be properly authorized under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa18s7A-192" target="_self">G.S. 7A-192</a></cite> to hold a session of court at which the matter is properly before him or under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa18s7A-192" target="_self">G.S. 7A-192</a></cite> to hear the matter in chambers.

       District judge assigned to preside at the session in question by the chief district judge of the Thirtieth Judicial District was not without authority to hear defendant's motion to dismiss in Swain County over written objection of plaintiff who had filed his complaint in Cherokee County.

      <p>
       Authority of Administrative Office of the Courts.
   
   - Trial court properly granted a motion filed by the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) and its director (jointly, the AOC) to dismiss the magistrates' action for lack of standing because, while the magistrates' complaint was premised upon their concern that adherence to their religious beliefs in refusing to perform same-sex marriages would result in their removal and the AOC had statutory authority to establish and evaluate judicial compliance with regulations, rules, and procedures, the AOC had no statutory authority to appoint, sanction, suspend, remove, or generally supervise magistrates, its guidance memoranda notwithstanding.

      <p>
       Judgment Entered by Unauthorized Judge Is Void.
   
   - The judgment entered by a district court judge in favor of plaintiff, which directed, among other things, that defendant immediately pay to plaintiff's attorney a certain sum for legal services rendered, was interlocutory and was void, since the district court judge who entered the order had not been assigned by the chief district judge to preside over a session of court in the county where the judgment was entered, nor was he authorized by order or rule entered by the chief judge to hear motions and enter interlocutory orders on that date.

      <p>
       Administrative Order for Discovery in Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.
   
   - Trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion by applying an administrative order governing all discovery in abuse, neglect, and dependency proceedings and denying the parents' motions to continue because the gravamen of the problem fell with the inability of the attorneys to make time to review the records in accordance with the administrative order. In re J.S., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 641 S.E.2d 395 (2007).

       § 7A-147. Specialized judgeships.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t7AsIVa14s7A-147ol1a">
       Prior to January 1 of each year in which elections for district court judges are to be held, the Administrative Officer of the Courts may, with the approval of the chief district judge, designate one or more judgeships in districts having three or more judgeships, as specialized judgeships, naming in each case the specialty. Designations shall become effective when filed with the State Board of Elections. Nominees for the position or positions of specialist judge shall be made in the ensuing primary and the position or positions shall be filled at the general election thereafter. The State Board of Elections shall prepare primary and general election ballots to effectuate the purposes of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIVa14s7A-147ol1b">
       The designation of a specialized judgeship shall in no way impair the right of the chief district judge to arrange sessions for the trial of specialized cases and to assign any district judge to preside over these sessions. A judge elected to a specialized judgeship has the same powers as a regular district judge.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIVa14s7A-147ol1c">
       The policy of the State is to encourage specialization in juvenile cases by district court judges who are qualified by training and temperament to be effective in relating to youth and in the use of appropriate community resources to meet their needs. The Administrative Office of the Courts is therefore authorized to encourage judges who hear juvenile cases to secure appropriate training whether or not they were elected to a specialized judgeship as provided herein. Such training shall be provided within the funds available to the Administrative Office of the Courts for such training, and judges attending such training shall be reimbursed for travel and subsistence expenses at the same rate as is applicable to other State employees.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The Administrative Office of the Courts shall develop a plan whereby a district court judge may be better qualified to hear juvenile cases by reason of training, experience, and demonstrated ability. Any district court judge who completes the training under this plan shall receive a certificate to this effect from the Administrative Office of the Courts. In districts where there is a district court judge who has completed this training as herein provided, the chief district judge shall give due consideration in the assignment of such cases where practical and feasible.

      Re-recodification; Technical and Conforming Changes.
   
   - Session Laws 2017-6, s. 3, provides, in part: "The Revisor of Statutes shall recodify <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.120C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 120C</a></cite> of the General Statutes, as well as <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163</a></cite> of the General Statutes, as amended by this act, into a new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163A</a></cite> of the General Statutes to be entitled 'Elections and Ethics Enforcement Act,' as enacted by Section 4 of this act. The Revisor may also recodify into the new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163A</a></cite> of the General Statutes other existing statutory laws relating to elections and ethics enforcement that are located elsewhere in the General Statutes as the Revisor deems appropriate." The Revisor was further authorized to make additional technical and conforming changes to catchlines, internal citations, and other references throughout the General Statutes to effectuate this recodification. Pursuant to this authority, the Revisor of Statutes, in subsection (a), twice substituted "Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement" for
   "State Board of Elections."

     <p>
      Session Laws 2018-146, ss. 3.1(a), (b), and 6.1 repealed Session Laws 2017-6, s. 3, and authorized the Revisor of Statutes to re-recodify <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163A</a></cite> into Chapters 163, 138A, and 120C and to revert the changes made by the Revisor pursuant to Session Laws 2017-6, s. 3.

       A magistrate is an officer of the district court,
   
   and in issuing a warrant a magistrate performs a judicial act. Foust v. Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 268, 204 S.E.2d 230, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 589</cite>, 205 S.E.2d 722 (1974).

       And Is Not Subject to Civil Action for Errors in Discharge of His Duties.
   
   - A judge of a court of this State is not subject to civil action for errors committed in the discharge of his official duties. This immunity applies even when the judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly, and is not for the protection or benefit of a malicious or corrupt judge, but for the benefit of the public, whose interest it is that judges should be at liberty to exercise their functions with independence and without fear of consequences. Thus plaintiff failed to state a claim for false imprisonment against a magistrate by reason of any act of the magistrate in issuing warrants for plaintiff's arrest. Foust v. Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 268, 204 S.E.2d 230, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 589</cite>, 205 S.E.2d 722 (1974).

       - Whether or not a magistrate's alleged comments made in connection with plaintiff's arrest regarding a domestic violence matter were appropriate, they were made in connection with judicial acts within the magistrate's jurisdiction; he was, therefore, entitled to immunity, and his motion to dismiss plaintiff's 42 U.S.C.S.

       The General Assembly shall establish a minimum quota of magistrates for each county. In no county shall the minimum quota be less than one.

       Suspension from performing the duties of the office may be ordered upon filing of sworn written charges in the office of clerk of superior court for the county in which the magistrate resides.

The hearing shall be held in a county within the district or set of districts not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days after the magistrate has received a copy of the charges. The hearing shall be open to the public. All testimony offered shall be recorded. At the hearing the superior court judge shall receive evidence, and make findings of fact and conclusions of law.

      Any district judge may hear motions and enter interlocutory orders in causes regularly calendared for trial or for the disposition of motions, at any session to which the district judge has been assigned to preside. The chief district judge and any district judge designated by written order or rule of the chief district judge, may in chambers hear motions and enter interlocutory orders in all causes pending in the district courts of the district, including causes transferred from the superior court to the district court under the provisions of this Chapter. The designation is effective from the time filed in the office of the clerk of superior court of each county of the district until revoked or amended by written order of the chief district judge.

      <p>
       Limitations on Authority of Judge Other Than Chief Judge to Hear Motions and Enter Interlocutory Orders.
   
   - The authority of a district judge (other than the chief district judge) to hear motions and enter interlocutory orders in cases properly pending in the district court is a special authority which is limited by this section. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the provisions of the first portion of this section, before a district court judge, other than the chief district judge, may hear motions and enter interlocutory orders at any session of district court in cases calendared for trial or hearing at such session, he must be first assigned by the chief district judge under the provisions of subdivision (1) of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa14s7A-146" target="_self">G.S. 7A-146</a></cite> to preside at such session. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to have authority to act on any motion, a district judge, other than the chief district judge, must be properly authorized under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa14s7A-146" target="_self">G.S. 7A-146</a></cite> and this section to hold a session of court at which the matter is properly before him, or under this section to hear the matter in chambers. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority of Such Judge Must Affirmatively Appear on Record.
   
   - There is no presumption that a district judge (other than the chief district judge) has authority in chambers to hear motions and enter interlocutory orders in all cases pending in the district courts of the district; it must affirmatively appear in the record that the district judge was authorized pursuant to this section. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Written Authorization for Hearing Motions in Chambers.
   
   - A district judge other than the chief district judge may hear motions and enter interlocutory orders during any session over which he has been assigned to preside, whether the assignment be oral or written, but he may not hear motions in chambers without written authorization. Jim Walter Homes, Inc. v. Peartree, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 709, 222 S.E.2d 706 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chambers matters may be heard by the chief district judge at any time and place within the district, but other district judges have no authority to hear chambers matters out of session except upon written order or rule of the chief district judge. Bowen v. Hodge Motor Co., <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 463, 224 S.E.2d 699 (1976), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 633</cite>, 234 S.E.2d 748 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge Authorized to Hear Motion.
   
   - District judge assigned to preside at the session in question by the chief district judge of the Thirtieth Judicial District was not without authority to hear defendant's motion to dismiss in Swain County over written objection of plaintiff who had filed his complaint in Cherokee County. Scroggs v. Ramsey, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 730, 329 S.E.2d 680 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Restraining Order in Action Pending in Another County in District.
   
   - A chief judge of the district court has jurisdiction to enter, in chambers in one county, a temporary restraining order in an action pending in the district court of another county in the judicial district, to return the order for hearing before him, and to enter an order continuing the restraining order in effect in the district court of the other county until the trial of the case on its merits. Boston v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 736, 171 S.E.2d 206 (1969).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporary Restraining Order Is Interlocutory Order.
   
   - A temporary restraining order, made permanent pending trial of the cause on its merits, is an interlocutory order. Boston v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 736, 171 S.E.2d 206 (1969).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment Entered by Unauthorized Judge Is Void.
   
   - The judgment entered by district court judge in favor of plaintiff, which directed, among other things, that defendant immediately pay to plaintiff 's attorney a certain sum for legal services rendered, was interlocutory and was void, since the district court judge who entered the order had not been assigned by the chief district judge to preside over a session of court in the county where the judgment was entered, nor was he authorized by order or rule entered by the chief judge to hear motions and enter interlocutory orders on that date.

       Right to Jury Trial in Civil Cases.
   
   - The right to trial by jury in civil cases in the district court is preserved by this section, provided timely demand is made in one of the ways authorized by statute. Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 179 S.E.2d 181 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right to Jury Trial in Criminal Cases.
   
   - The constitutional right of a defendant charged with a misdemeanor to have a jury trial is not infringed by the fact that he has first to submit to trial without a jury in the district court and then appeal to superior court in order to obtain a jury trial. State v. Sherron, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 166 S.E.2d 836 (1969).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of a verdict of guilty by the district court in the trial of a misdemeanor
   
   is tantamount to a verdict of guilty returned by a jury. State v. Surles, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 284 S.E.2d 738 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 307</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 707 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial judge's authority over its nonjury verdict
   
   is no greater than the authority of the trial judge over a jury verdict. State v. Surles, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 284 S.E.2d 738 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 307</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 707 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Demand for Trial by Jury Is Timely.
   
   - The demand for trial by jury in a civil case is timely if made in writing not later than 10 days after the filing of the last pleading directed to the issues. Holcomb v. Holcomb, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 172 S.E.2d 212 (1970); Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 179 S.E.2d 181 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       One authorized method of making the demand
   
   is by endorsement on the pleading of the party. Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 179 S.E.2d 181 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Error to Deny Jury Trial Timely Demanded.
   
   - Defendants having made timely demand in a manner authorized by statute, it was error for the district judge to deny them a jury trial. Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 179 S.E.2d 181 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Waiver of Jury Trial.
   
   - The failure of a party to make a demand for jury trial within the 10-day limitation period is a waiver of the right to a jury trial. Holcomb v. Holcomb, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 172 S.E.2d 212 (1970).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Transfer of Case Without Notice Denied Defendant's Right to Jury Trial.
   
   - Defendant was denied its constitutional right to a jury trial where the action was transferred from the superior court division to the district court division without notice to defendant, so that defendant made no demand for jury trial in the district court within the 10-day time period formerly allowed by this section (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 38), and the district court subsequently denied defendant's demand for a jury trial.

       A hearing on a motion for alimony pendente lite is not a civil trial
   
   within the meaning of this section. Howell v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 198 S.E.2d 462 (1973).

       Ex Parte Domestic Violence Protection Order Hearing.
   
   - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa18s7A-198ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7A-198(e)</a></cite> requires that an ex parte domestic violence protection order hearing be recorded. Stancill v. Stancill, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 773 S.E.2d 890 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Motion for Services of Reporter May Be Refused.
   
   - If the case is one in which a court reporter's services can be dispensed with without prejudice, and no reporter can be found, it is not error to refuse a motion for the services of a reporter. McAlister v. McAlister, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 187 S.E.2d 449, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 315</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 898 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Request for Recordation in District Court.
   
   - In district court, where there are no official court reporters, a party seeking recordation of a hearing or trial must request a reporter or mechanical recordation; failure to make such a request prevents the issue from being raised on appeal. Holterman v. Holterman, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 109, 488 S.E.2d 265 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not error for the trial judge to fail to appoint a stenographer where no stenographer is available
   
   and where the defendant made no motion that any other means be employed when his motion for a court reporter was denied. McAlister v. McAlister, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 187 S.E.2d 449, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 315</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 898 (1972).
   <br />

      <p>
       The absence of stenographic notes is not always fatal,
   
   even when oral testimony is introduced, if no prejudice is shown to result. McAlister v. McAlister, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 187 S.E.2d 449, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 315</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 898 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of Court to Record Hearing.
   
   - Court's violation of this section, by not preserving or recording hearing on modification of child custody order, did not relieve appellant of her burden of complying with N.C.R.A.P., Rule 9(a)(1)(v) and showing prejudicial error. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 374 S.E.2d 467 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where respondent argued that he must receive a new hearing because children's testimony, which was taken in chambers with all counsel present, was not recorded, respondent did not argue any error in the unrecorded testimony itself and failed to show prejudice. In re Nolen, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 453 S.E.2d 220 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ex parte domestic violence protection order hearing did not err because an erroneous failure to record the hearing did not prejudice defendant husband. Stancill v. Stancill, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 773 S.E.2d 890 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of Tape Device.
   
   - Absent contemporaneous objection to the use of tape devices, in order to show prejudicial error on account of a tape device not working, an appellant must at least indicate the import of some specific testimony or other proceeding that has been lost. Simply conjecturing that there may have been objections to critical testimony, without showing why any such testimony ought to have been excluded, will not support reversal, particularly when trial counsel assists in reconstructing the record. In re Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 330 S.E.2d 513 (1985).

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Transcript of Juvenile Proceedings Held Necessary.
   
   - Where lower court ordered preparation of the transcript of juvenile proceedings for appeal purposes, and the record disclosed no adequate alternative devices that would have fulfilled the same functions as the transcript, the transcript was necessary for appellant to prepare her appeal and was "required" under subsection (c) of this section. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Reimbursement of Juvenile's Attorney for Preparation of Transcript.
   
   - As juvenile appellant was entitled to transcript at state expense, her attorney was entitled to be reimbursed for his reasonable expenses in having the transcript prepared. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

       In any jury civil action regularly assigned for a hearing or trial before a district judge at a seat of the district court in a municipality the corporate limits of which extend into two or more contiguous counties, venue is properly laid for such jury trial if by statute or common law it is properly laid in any of the contiguous counties; provided, however, any such action shall be instituted in the county of proper venue, and the jurors summoned shall be from the county where such action was instituted. Notwithstanding the fact that the place of trial within such municipality is in a different county from the county where such action was commenced, the sheriff of the county where such action was commenced is authorized to summon the jurors to appear at such place of trial. Such jurors shall be subject to the same challenge as other jurors, except challenges for nonresidence in the county of trial.

       A district court judge sitting at a seat of court described in this section may, in criminal cases, conduct preliminary hearings and try misdemeanors arising within the corporate limits of the municipality plus the territory embraced within a distance of one mile in all directions therefrom.

     </ol>
     <p>
      If the corporate limits of the municipality extend into two or more counties, each of which is in a separate district court district, a district court judge assigned to sit at the seat of court has the same authority over criminal cases arising in the municipality and the territory embraced within a distance of one mile in all directions that he would have if the corporate limits of the municipality were solely located in a single district court district. Judges assigned to sit in such a municipality shall be assigned by the chief district court judge serving the district in which a majority of the voters of the municipality reside, but offenses arising in a portion of the municipality in which a minority of the voters reside shall not be disposed of in the municipality unless the chief district court judge for that district consents in writing to the disposition of criminal cases in the municipality. However, for charges brought by municipal law enforcement officers only, if the corporate limits of the municipality extend into four or more counties, each of which is in a separate district court district, offenses arising in a portion of the municipality in which a minority of the voters reside shall be disposed of in the portion of the municipality in which a majority of the voters reside without obtaining the consent of the chief district court judge for the district in which the offense occurred.

       § 7A-210. Small claim action defined.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For purposes of this Article a small claim action is a civil action wherein:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t7AsIVa19s7A-210ol11">
       The amount in controversy, computed in accordance with G.S. 7A-243, does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000); and
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIVa19s7A-210ol12">
       The only principal relief prayed is monetary, or the recovery of specific personal property, or summary ejectment, or any combination of the foregoing in properly joined claims; and
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIVa19s7A-210ol13">
       The plaintiff has requested assignment to a magistrate in the manner provided in this Article.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The seeking of the ancillary remedy of claim and delivery or an order from the clerk of superior court for the relinquishment of property subject to a lien pursuant to G.S 44A-4(a) does not prevent an action otherwise qualifying as a small claim under this Article from so qualifying.

   - Where the amount in controversy for plaintiff's claims was in excess of the dollar requirement for a small claim action, but less than the $ 10,000 requirement for an action in the superior court, the claim was within the jurisdiction of the district court, and the district court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear these claims.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The plaintiff files his complaint in a small claim action in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county wherein the defendant, or one of the defendants resides. The designation "Small Claim" on the face of the complaint is a request for assignment. If, pursuant to order or rule, the action is assigned to a magistrate, the clerk issues a magistrate summons substantially in the form prescribed in this Article as soon as practicable after the assignment is made. The issuance of a magistrate summons commences the action. After service of the magistrate summons on the defendant, the clerk gives written notice of the assignment to the plaintiff. The notice of assignment identifies the action, designates the magistrate to whom assignment is made, and specifies the time, date and place of trial. By any convenient means the clerk notifies the magistrate of the assignment and the setting.

      Failure of the chief district judge to assign a claim within five days after filing of a complaint requesting its assignment constitutes nonassignment. The chief district judge may sooner order nonassignment. Upon nonassignment, the clerk immediately issues summons in the manner and form provided for commencement of civil actions generally, whereupon process is served, return made, and pleadings are required to be filed in the manner provided for civil actions generally. Upon issuing civil summons, the clerk gives written notice of nonassignment to the plaintiff. The plaintiff within five days after notice of nonassignment, and the defendant before or with the filing of his answer, may request a jury trial. Failure within the times so limited to request a jury trial constitutes a waiver of the right thereto. Upon the joining of issue, the clerk places the action upon the civil issue docket for trial in the district court division.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When by order or rule a small claim action is assigned to a magistrate, the court may obtain jurisdiction over the person of the defendant by the following methods:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t7AsIVa19s7A-217ol11">
       By delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the defendant or by leaving copies thereof at the defendant's dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein. When the defendant is under any legal disability, the defendant may be subjected to personal jurisdiction only by personal service of process in the manner provided by G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(j)(2).
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIVa19s7A-217ol12">
       When the defendant is not under any legal disability, the defendant may be served by registered or certified mail, signature confirmation, or designated delivery service as provided in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(j). Proof of service is as provided in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(j2).
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIVa19s7A-217ol13">
       When the defendant is under no legal disability, the defendant may be subjected to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant by written acceptance of service or by voluntary appearance.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIVa19s7A-217ol14">
       In summary ejectment cases only, service as provided in G.S. 42-29 is also authorized.

       Counterclaim in Ejectment Action Not Allowed.
   
   - Where a tenant sought damages in excess of $10,000 on improper summary ejectment claim, the tenant could not plead the claim as a compulsory counterclaim to the ejectment action while it was before a magistrate.

       District court properly dismissed a tenant's appeal and its accompanying counterclaims, which were brought for the first time on appeal, because, while the tenant was not an "aggrieved party" inasmuch as the small claims court denied the landlord's request for summary ejectment, she was still free to seek appropriate redress for her claims against the landlord by bringing a separate action "notwithstanding" the fact that the counterclaims were compulsive.

       Failure to Assert Counterclaim on Appeal Resulted in Res Judicata.
   
   - The plaintiffs' claims for retaliatory eviction were a compulsory counterclaim which should have been asserted in the appeal from the magistrate's judgment in the prior summary ejectment proceeding - the amount in controversy would have prevented it from being asserted before the magistrate - and the plaintiffs were, therefore, precluded by the doctrine of res judicata from asserting their claims in a second action; the determinative question in both actions was whether the plaintiffs breached their respective lease agreements, making defendants' termination of the lease agreements valid.

       § 7A-221. Objections to venue and jurisdiction over person.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      By motion prior to filing answer, or in the answer, the defendant may object that the venue is improper, or move for change of venue, or object to the jurisdiction of the court over his person. These motions or objections are heard on notice by the chief district judge or a district judge designated by order or rule of the chief district judge. Assignment to the magistrate is suspended pending determination of the objection, and the clerk gives notice of the suspension by any convenient means to the magistrate to whom the action has been assigned. All these objections are waived if not made prior to the date set for trial. If venue is determined to be improper, or is ordered changed, the action is transferred to the district court of the new venue, and is not thereafter assigned to a magistrate, but proceeds as in the case of civil actions generally.

       Trial of a small claim action before a magistrate is without a jury. The rules of evidence applicable in the trial of civil actions generally are observed. At the conclusion of plaintiff's evidence the magistrate may render judgment of dismissal if plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case. If a judgment of dismissal is not rendered the defendant may introduce evidence. At the conclusion of all the evidence the magistrate may render judgment or may in his discretion reserve judgment for a period not in excess of 10 days, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIVa19s7A-222ol1b">
       In a small claim action for summary ejectment, the magistrate shall render judgment on the same day on which the conclusion of all the evidence and submission of legal authorities occurs, unless the parties concur on an extension of additional time for entering the judgment and except for more complex summary ejectment cases, in which event the magistrate shall render judgment within five business days of the hearing. Complex summary ejectment cases include cases brought for criminal activity, breaches other than nonpayment of rent, evictions involving SECTION 8 of the Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. § 1437f) or public housing tenants, and cases with counterclaims.

       In any small claim action demanding summary ejectment or past due rent, or both, the complaint may be signed by an agent acting for the plaintiff who has actual knowledge of the facts alleged in the complaint. If a small claim action demanding summary ejectment is assigned to a magistrate, the practice and procedure prescribed for commencement, form and service of process, assignment, pleadings, and trial in small claim actions generally are observed, except that if the defendant by written answer denies the title of the plaintiff, the action is placed on the civil issue docket of the district court division for trial before a district judge. In such event, the clerk withdraws assignment of the action from the magistrate and immediately gives written notice of withdrawal, by any convenient means, to the plaintiff and the magistrate to whom the action has been assigned. The plaintiff, within five days after receipt of the notice, and the defendant, in his answer, may request trial by jury. Failure to request jury trial within the time limited is a waiver of the right to trial by jury.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIVa19s7A-223ol1b">
       If either party in a small claim action for summary ejectment moves for a continuance, the magistrate shall render a decision on the motion in accordance with Rule 40(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. The magistrate shall not continue a matter for more than five days or until the next session of small claims court, whichever is longer, without the consent of both parties.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsIVa19s7A-223ol1-b1">
       In any small claim action demanding summary ejectment and monetary damages, and where service of process has been achieved solely by first-class mail and affixing the summons and complaint to the premises pursuant to G.S. 42-29, the plaintiff, or an agent pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, may request that the claim for summary ejectment be severed from the claim for monetary damages. Upon a finding that personal service was not achieved for one or more defendants, the magistrate shall sever the claim for monetary damages and proceed with the claim for summary ejectment. If the magistrate severs the claim for monetary damages, the plaintiff may extend the action in accordance with G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(d). The judgment of the magistrate in the severed claim for summary ejectment shall not prejudice the claims or defenses of any party in the severed claim for monetary damages.

       The chief district court judge may authorize magistrates to hear motions to set aside an order or judgment pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 60(b)(1) and order a new trial before a magistrate. The exercise of the authority of the chief district court judge in allowing magistrates to hear Rule 60(b)(1) motions shall not be construed to limit the authority of the district court to hear motions pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) through (6) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for relief from a judgment or order entered by a magistrate and, if granted, to order a new trial before a magistrate. After final disposition before the magistrate, the sole remedy for an aggrieved party is appeal for trial de novo before a district court judge or a jury. Notice of appeal may be given orally in open court upon announcement or after entry of judgment. If not announced in open court, written notice of appeal must be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court within 10 days after entry of judgment. The appeal must be perfected in the manner set out in subsection (b). Upon announcement of the appeal in open court or upon receipt of the written notice of appeal, the appeal shall be noted upon the judgment. If the judgment was mailed to the parties, then the time computations for appeal of such judgment shall be pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 6.

       The appeal shall be perfected by (1) oral announcement of appeal in open court; or (2) by filing notice of appeal in the office of the clerk of superior court within 10 days after entry of judgment pursuant to subsection (a), and by serving a copy of the notice of appeal on all parties pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 5. Failure to pay the costs of court to appeal within 10 days after entry of judgment in a summary ejectment action, and within 20 days after entry of judgment in all other actions, shall result in the automatic dismissal of the appeal. Notwithstanding the foregoing deadlines, if an appealing party petitions to qualify as an indigent for the appeal and is denied, that party shall have an additional five days to perfect the appeal by paying the court costs. The failure to demand a trial by jury in district court by the appealing party before the time to perfect the appeal has expired is a waiver of the right thereto.

       A person desiring to appeal as an indigent shall, within 10 days of entry of judgment by the magistrate, file an affidavit that he or she is unable by reason of poverty to pay the costs of appeal.

The clerk of superior court shall authorize a person to appeal as an indigent if the person files the required affidavit and meets one or more of the criteria listed in G.S. 1-110. A superior or district court judge, a magistrate, or the clerk of the superior court may authorize a person who does not meet any of the criteria listed in G.S. 1-110 to appeal as an indigent if the person cannot pay the costs of appeal.

The defendant may defeat the motion to dismiss by responding within 10 days of receipt of the motion by doing any of the following acts: (i) filing a responsive motion, answer, or counterclaim and serving the plaintiff with a copy thereof or (ii) paying the amount due under the bond to stay execution, if any amount is owed by the defendant. If the defendant is not required by law to make any payment under the bond to stay execution, the court shall not use the failure to make a payment as a basis to dismiss the appeal. The court shall review the file, determine whether the motion satisfies the requirements of this subsection, determine whether the defendant has made a sufficient response to defeat the motion, and shall enter an order resolving the matter without a hearing.

   Under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 58, where the magistrate "rendered" his judgment in open court and the evidence was clear that he announced the judgment in open court, both dismissing plaintiff 's action and awarding defendants a sum certain on their counterclaim, entry of the magistrate's judgment was deemed to occur at the time of rendition.

       District Court Could Decide Trial De Novo on Appeal on the Basis of Just the Pleadings.
   
   - In a trial de novo on appeal to the district court from a small claims money judgment, the district court had the statutory authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa19s7A-229" target="_self">G.S. 7A-229</a></cite> to decide the case on the pleadings and, since the informal procedures of the small claims court carried over to the appeal, the district court was not required to give the separate, detailed legal conclusions that were required by N.C. R. Civ. P. 52. Jones v. Ratley, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 126, 607 S.E.2d 38 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a landlord successfully sued a tenant for summary ejectment in small claims court, and the tenant obtained a trial de novo in district court, the tenant did not waive its affirmative defense of estoppel by not pleading it in district court because, in small claims court, the only pleading was the complaint, and on appeal to district court, the district court judge could elect to try the case on the pleadings filed, so the tenant did not waive its affirmative defense.

      <p>
       Except for the original jurisdiction in respect of claims against the State which is vested in the Supreme Court, original general jurisdiction of all justiciable matters of a civil nature cognizable in the General Court of Justice is vested in the aggregate in the superior court division and the district court division as the trial divisions of the General Court of Justice. Except in respect of proceedings in probate and the administration of decedents' estates, the original civil jurisdiction so vested in the trial divisions is vested concurrently in each division.

         Judicial Immunity.
        </b>
        - Judges of courts of general jurisdiction are fully clothed by both logic and precedent with the shield of judicial immunity. Fowler v. Alexander, 340 F. Supp. 168 (M.D.N.C. 1972), aff'd, 478 F.2d 694 (4th Cir. 1973).

        Jurisdiction over Member of Eastern Band of Cherokee in Tort Claim.
   
   - The courts of this State have jurisdiction over a member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in a tort claim by a non-Indian arising from an occurrence on land within the Qualla Boundary. Sasser v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 253 S.E.2d 577, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 300</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 915 (1979).

       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction over All Justiciable Matters Not Placed Elsewhere.
   
   - Except for areas specifically placing jurisdiction elsewhere (such as claims under the Workers' Compensation Act), the trial courts of North Carolina have subject matter jurisdiction over "all justiciable matters of a civil nature." Harris v. Pembaur, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 666, 353 S.E.2d 673 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless jurisdiction is specifically placed elsewhere, both the superior court division and the district court division have subject matter jurisdiction over all "justiciable" civil claims. State ex rel. Thornburg v. Lot &amp; Bldgs. at 800 Waughtown St., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 421 S.E.2d 374, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 170</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 915 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to either North Carolina or Utah law, North Carolina had subject matter and personal jurisdiction over plaintiff's case and defendant because defendant was a citizen and resident of North Carolina,and he purposefully availed himself of the benefits of conducting business there as an unincorporated entity; the contract dispute was a justiciable matter that was cognizable in the North Carolina trial courts, which was not prohibited by law or otherwise excepted by statute or Constitution. Federated Fin. Corp. of Am. v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 330, 719 S.E.2d 48 (2011).

Intersal, Inc. v. Hamilton, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 89</cite>, 834 S.E.2d 404 (2019).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Contract dispute between the parties constituted a "justiciable matter"
   
   that is "cognizable" in North Carolina trial courts; therefore, trial judge's determination that there was no subject matter jurisdiction was in error. Harris v. Pembaur, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 666, 353 S.E.2d 673 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Challenge to Statutes Regarding Trial Calendar.
   
   - Plaintiffs' pending criminal prosecutions did not deprive the superior court of jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs' constitutional challenge to the statutes which authorize the district attorney to set the criminal trial calendar. Simeon v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 358</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 858 (1994).

   - Where executor of decedent's estate filed its petition for hearing requesting instructions from the clerk of superior court as to whether surviving spouse was entitled to participate in the administration, settlement and distribution of decedent's estate, the claims at issue were claims of misrepresentation, undue influence and inadequate disclosure of assets or liabilities, clearly justiciable matters of a civil nature, original general jurisdiction over which is vested in the trial division; the superior court judge properly found that the clerk lacked jurisdiction in this matter and properly voided the clerk's order. In re Estate of Wright, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 659, 442 S.E.2d 540, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 516</cite>, 453 S.E.2d 174 (1994).

        Concurrent Jurisdiction to Hear Application for Restraining Order Pending Trial on the Merits.
   
   - An application for a restraining order pending trial on the merits is a justiciable matter of a civil nature which is cognizable in the General Court of Justice, and the original general jurisdiction to hear the application and issue such order is vested concurrently in the superior court division and the district court division.

        Jurisdiction over Action to Recover for Breach of Duties, Negligence, and Fraud in Administration of Estate.
   
   - In action to recover for breach of fiduciary duties, negligence, and fraud arising from administration of estate of plaintiff's husband and a trust created under his will, dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the claims alleged should have been brought initially before the clerk was improper, since the claims were "justiciable matters of a civil nature," original general jurisdiction over which was vested in the trial division, and their resolution was not part of the administration, settlement, or distribution of an estate so as to make jurisdiction properly exercisable initially by the clerk; moreover, inclusion by plaintiff in her complaint of matters which should have been brought initially before the clerk did not require dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction of the entire action.

        Superior Court Jurisdiction in Summary Ejectment Actions.
   
   - When the legislature created the district court division and gave it concurrent original jurisdiction over all matters except probate and matters of decedents' estates, it did not thereby divest the superior court division of any of its original jurisdiction; hence, the superior court division has original jurisdiction over summary ejectment actions.

        Superior Court Jurisdiction in Child Custody Actions.
   
   - The legislature has enunciated a public policy that every child should have a permanent plan of care. Because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent plan of care, and because the superior court has jurisdiction over adoptions, that court's jurisdiction supersedes that of the district court with regard to the custody of a child who is the subject of a simultaneous adoption and custody proceeding.

       <p>
        Upon the entry of an interlocutory order of adoption by the superior court, the jurisdiction of the district court with regard to the custody of the child who is the subject of the interlocutory order is in abeyance until such time as the interlocutory decree is vacated, the adoption petition is dismissed, or a final decree of adoption is entered.

        Superior Court Jurisdiction Over Action to Collect on Promissory Notes.
   
   - In a case in which the guarantor of two promissory notes argued on appeal that a North Carolina superior court lacked jurisdiction over an action to collect on the promissory note because the case involved a note and guaranty prepared, executed, delivered, and to be performed in Georgia, between two parties, who both, at execution and now, resided in Georgia, that argument failed. The promissory notes were guaranteed in order to secure funds for the development of real estate in North Carolina, the notes were each in excess of $10,000.00, and the individual's action was a civil matter for the collection of a debt that was not otherwise delegated to the district court division; therefore, under the rationale of the Schall decision, the superior court had jurisdiction to hear and decide the case.

   - After a judge entered his order transferring a case from the superior court division of the General Court of Justice to the district court division, the latter being the proper division in which to try the case, nothing else appearing, disposition of the case thereafter in the superior court was irregular and contrary to the course and practice in the General Court of Justice.

        Dispute Over Settlement Agreement.
   
   - When petitioner on appeal from an order of the clerk of superior court attacked a prior court decision, there was no merit to her claim that the prior decision was void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; the trial court had not been addressing an estate matter under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa02s28A-2-1" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-2-1</a></cite> but determining whether there were issues of fact about the terms of a settlement agreement following a mediation; it had jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va20s7A-240" target="_self">G.S. 7A-240</a></cite> to do this, as it later had jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement reached by the parties.

        Institution of Action in Improper Trial Division.
   
   - It is fairly common practice for an attorney to institute an action in district court, although not the proper division, in order to schedule an earlier trial date than would be available on the superior court calendar. This practice is allowed since original civil jurisdiction is vested concurrently in both divisions and since a judgment is not void or voidable solely because it was rendered in the improper trial division.

   - Under this section, the clerk of superior court, "as ex officio judge of probate," continues to exercise probate jurisdiction "according to the practice and procedure provided by law"; and in doing so, he continues to act as "a judicial officer of the superior court division, and not as a separate court" pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa07s7A-40" target="_self">G.S. 7A-40</a></cite>.

        This section reemphasizes the fact that the district courts have no jurisdiction of probate matters,

        Derivative Probate Jurisdiction of Judge.
   
   - In most instances a superior court judge's probate jurisdiction is, in effect, that of an appellate court, because his jurisdiction is derivative and not concurrent. In re Estate of Longest, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 328 S.E.2d 804, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 330</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 488 (1985).

       <p>
        Allocation of Jurisdiction Between Clerk and Judge.
   
   - This section does not say that concurrent jurisdiction in probate matters is vested in the clerk and the judge of the superior court. It says that probate jurisdiction is vested in the superior court division to be exercised by the superior court and the clerk according to the practice and procedure provided by law. The law, that is, the statutes specifying this practice and procedure, has allocated the jurisdiction between the clerk and the judge. By <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa02s28A-2-1" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-2-1</a></cite> the clerk is given exclusive original jurisdiction of "the administration, settlement and distribution of estates of decedents" except in cases where the clerk is disqualified to act under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa02s28A-2-3" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-2-3</a></cite>. When the clerk is disqualified to exercise his jurisdiction the judge has equal authority to perform the clerk's probate duties and, in that sense, he exercises concurrent jurisdiction of probate matters. In all other instances, however, the judge's probate jurisdiction is, in effect, that of an appellate court pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va20s7A-251" target="_self">G.S. 7A-251</a></cite>.

        Although this section provides that exclusive original jurisdiction in probate matters is vested in the "superior court division," <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa02s28A-2-1" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-2-1</a></cite> specifies that the clerk is given exclusive original jurisdiction in the administration of decedents' estates except in cases where the clerk is disqualified to act.

        Submission of Issue Involving Probate and Nonprobate Matters.
   
   - The judge of superior court in the exercise of his inherent powers upon appeal from the clerk's finding had the right to submit to the jury the one issue that would resolve both the right to qualify as administratrix, a probate matter, and the right to share in the decedent's estate, which was not a probate matter.

        Superior court properly dismissed a former wife's claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, constructive fraud, and constructive trust for lack of jurisdiction because she could not recover her unpaid distributive award from the proceeds of the decedent's estate inasmuch as she already owned her distributive award and had to attempt to enforce her rights through the underlying equitable distribution action in the district court, which had jurisdiction.

        Strict Construction of Appeal Procedure from Clerk Conflicts with Section.

But this strict construction would ignore the "according to the practice and procedure provided by law" mandate of this section. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C.

        Procedure in Superior Court on Appeal from Clerk.
   
   - In an appeal from an order of the clerk in a probate matter, the superior court is not required to conduct a de novo hearing. Rather, when a finding of fact by the clerk of court is properly challenged by specific exception, the superior court judge will review those findings, and either affirm, reverse, or modify them. If he deems it advisable, he may submit the issue to a jury, which course he could not follow without hearing evidence. In re Estate of Longest, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 328 S.E.2d 804, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 330</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 488 (1985).

        § 7A-242. Concurrently held original jurisdiction allocated between trial divisions.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       For the efficient administration of justice in respect of civil matters as to which the trial divisions have concurrent original jurisdiction, the respective divisions are constituted proper or improper for the trial and determination of specific actions and proceedings in accordance with the allocations provided in this Article. But no judgment rendered by any court of the trial divisions in any civil action or proceeding as to which the trial divisions have concurrent original jurisdiction is void or voidable for the sole reason that it was rendered by the court of a trial division which by such allocation is improper for the trial and determination of the civil action or proceeding.

        Administrative allocations of case loads between the divisions are not jurisdictional,
   
   since a judgment is not void or voidable for the reason that it was rendered by a court of the trial division which by the statutory allocation was the improper division for hearing and determining the matter. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 448</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 30 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The superior court division or the district court division, or both, are designated as "proper" divisions in which to bring a given civil action, and no order of the district court may be overturned merely because it was not the proper division to enter the order.

        Institution of Action in Improper Trial Division.
   
   - It is fairly common practice for an attorney to institute an action in district court, although not the proper division, in order to schedule an earlier trial date than would be available on the superior court calendar. This practice is allowed since original civil jurisdiction is vested concurrently in both divisions and since a judgment is not void or voidable solely because it was rendered in the improper trial division.

        § 7A-243. Proper division for trial of civil actions generally determined by amount in controversy.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the district court division is the proper division for the trial of all civil actions in which the amount in controversy is twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) or less; and the superior court division is the proper division for the trial of all civil actions in which the amount in controversy exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of determining the amount in controversy, the following rules apply whether the relief prayed is monetary or nonmonetary, or both, and with respect to claims asserted by complaint, counterclaim, cross-complaint or third-party complaint:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t7As0Va20s7A-243ol11">
        The amount in controversy is computed without regard to interest and costs.
       </li>
       <li id="t7As0Va20s7A-243ol12">
        Where monetary relief is prayed, the amount prayed for is in controversy unless the pleading in question shows to a legal certainty that the amount claimed cannot be recovered under the applicable measure of damages. The value of any property seized in attachment, claim and delivery, or other ancillary proceeding, is not in controversy and is not considered in determining the amount in controversy.
       </li>
       <li id="t7As0Va20s7A-243ol13">
        Where no monetary relief is sought, but the relief sought would establish, enforce, or avoid an obligation, right or title, the value of the obligation, right, or title is in controversy. Where the owner or legal possessor of property seeks recovery of property on which a lien is asserted pursuant to G.S. 44A-4(a) the amount in controversy is that portion of the asserted lien which is disputed. The judge may require by rule or order that parties make a good faith estimate of the value of any nonmonetary relief sought.
       </li>
       <li id="t7As0Va20s7A-243ol14">

      (4) a. Except as provided in subparagraph c of this subdivision, where a single party asserts two or more properly joined claims, the claims are aggregated in computing the amount in controversy.
         </li>

          Except as provided in subparagraph c, where there are two or more parties properly joined in an action and their interests are aligned, their claims are aggregated in computing the amount in controversy.

          No claims are aggregated which are mutually exclusive and in the alternative, or which are successive, in the sense that satisfaction of one claim will bar recovery upon the other.

          Where there are two or more claims not subject to aggregation the highest claim is the amount in controversy.

       <li id="t7As0Va20s7A-243ol15">

The promissory notes were guaranteed in order to secure funds for the development of real estate in North Carolina, the notes were each in excess of $10,000.00, and the individual's action was a civil matter for the collection of a debt that was not otherwise delegated to the district court division; therefore, under the rationale of the Schall decision, the superior court had jurisdiction to hear and decide the case.

        This section is merely an administrative allocation of annulment, divorce, alimony, child support and child custody actions

        Jurisdiction of District Court.
   
   - The district court is, under the provisions of this section, a court of general jurisdiction for the trial of civil actions and proceedings for annulment, divorce, alimony, child support, and child custody. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420 (1971); Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 812, 290 S.E.2d 390 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly exercised jurisdiction over the subject matter of the parties' divorce action as in the State of North Carolina, subject matter jurisdiction for divorce involves not only bringing the matter in the correct court, but also the court's finding residence by one of the parties for the requisite length of time and verification of the pleadings. In the case at issue, the plaintiff husband sufficiently alleged that he was a citizen and resident of North Carolina for more than six months next preceding the institution of the action and had lived separate and apart from the wife for more than one year next preceding the institution of the action without resuming the marital relationship, with those district court findings being supported by the husband's verified complaint, which was treated as an affidavit. Wilson v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 789, 666 S.E.2d 653 (2008).

       <p>
        Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va20s7A-244" target="_self">G.S. 7A-244</a></cite>, the district court had exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over a former husband's motion for an order requiring his former wife to show cause why she was not in contempt of a child support order requiring that monies in a fund be used solely to satisfy the husband's child support obligation and the unreimbursed medical expenses of the parties' children. That the district court referred to the fund as a constructive trust did not place the administration and accounting of the fund under the superior court's jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.036C.html#t36Ca02s36C-2-203" target="_blank">G.S. 36C-2-203</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the spouses were Florida residents for years, a district court would have lacked jurisdiction over any potential divorce or equitable distribution claim that one of the spouses could have potentially brought. Ward v. Fogel, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 768 S.E.2d 292 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court properly dismissed a former wife's claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, constructive fraud, and constructive trust for lack of jurisdiction because she could not recover her unpaid distributive award from the proceeds of the decedent's estate inasmuch as she already owned her distributive award and had to attempt to enforce her rights through the underlying equitable distribution action in the district court, which had jurisdiction. Watson v. Joyner-Watson, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 823 S.E.2d 122 (2018).

       <p>
        Plaintiff, a resident of North Carolina and a party to the separation agreement and property settlement, sought enforcement for breach of an asserted prior mutually agreed-upon division, which the statute conferred jurisdiction in the district court of North Carolina. Furthermore, defendant consented in the agreement to in personam jurisdiction and thus the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the agreement, personal jurisdiction over the parties, and was a proper forum to adjudicate the parties' disputed claims. Poindexter v. Everhart, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 844 (2020).

        Alimony Jurisdiction.
   
   - The district court has jurisdiction over alimony proceedings and, indeed, the legislature has decreed that it is the only "proper" division for such a proceeding. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 174 S.E.2d 2 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Divorce Property Settlement Agreement Disputes.
   
   - Transfer of a matter regarding a settlement of a divorce property agreement dispute to the district court was proper as there was no support for a husband's claim that a consent order was set aside only because it was entered in the improper division; the district court was the proper division for litigating the matter under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va20s7A-244" target="_self">G.S. 7A-244</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Child Custody Jurisdiction.
   
   - The district courts of this State possess general subject matter jurisdiction over child custody disputes. Such matters are in no wise reserved by the Constitution or laws of North Carolina to the exclusive consideration of another tribunal. Therefore, the real question under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act is whether jurisdiction is properly exercised according to the statutory requirements in a particular case. Sloop v. Friberg, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 690, 320 S.E.2d 921 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of petition filed, signed and verified by the county division of social services, which alleged that the child had been placed with DSS by its mother; that the putative father was unknown; that North Carolina was the home state of the child and no other state had jurisdiction over the child; and that the best interest of the child would be served if the court assumed jurisdiction over him. In re Scearce, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 345 S.E.2d 404, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 415</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 589 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature has enunciated a public policy that every child should have a permanent plan of care. Because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent plan of care, and because the superior court has jurisdiction over adoptions, that court's jurisdiction supersedes that of the district court with regard to the custody of a child who is the subject of a simultaneous adoption and custody proceeding. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the entry of an interlocutory order of adoption by the superior court, the jurisdiction of the district court with regard to the custody of the child who is the subject of the interlocutory order is in abeyance until such time as the interlocutory decree is vacated, the adoption petition is dismissed, or a final decree of adoption is entered. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an adoption proceeding was filed before the child's father filed an action for custody, In order to avoid unresolvable conflicts, the trial court had to decline to exercise its jurisdiction in the custody action while the adoption proceeding was pending by holding the custody action in abeyance. Johns v. Welker, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 177, 744 S.E.2d 486 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in dismissing a father's action for custody of his son, as it did not lack subject matter jurisdiction due to a prior pending adoption proceeding involving the son; the "prior pending action" doctrine did not apply, as the parties were not the same in both actions and they did not request the same relief. Johns v. Welker, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 177, 744 S.E.2d 486 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Continuing Jurisdiction in Child Custody Matters.
   
   - Once jurisdiction of the court attaches to a child custody matter, it exists for all time until the cause is fully and completely determined. In re Scearce, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 345 S.E.2d 404, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 415</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 589 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any point in a proceeding under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act
   
   (G.S. 50A-1, et seq.), and that such jurisdiction cannot be conferred by waiver, estoppel or consent. Sloop v. Friberg, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 690, 320 S.E.2d 921 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Venue in Custody and Support Modification Action.
   
   - Waiver of venue occurs when a custody and support modification request is filed with the district court in an improper county and there is no timely demand that the trial be conducted in the proper county. In such event, the district court in the improper county appropriately adjudicates the modification request. Brooks v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 418 S.E.2d 534 (1992).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Proceedings Pursuant to Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act.
   
   - The district court had exclusive original jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding pursuant to the former Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (G.S. 52A-1, et seq.). Cline v. Cline, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 170 S.E.2d 645 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Same - Determination of Paternity.
   
   - Since the district court has exclusive original jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding under the former Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (G.S. 52A-1, et seq.), it is clear that the district court has jurisdiction to determine the issue of paternity in such a case. Amaker v. Amaker, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 558, 221 S.E.2d 917 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Authority to Enforce Judgments.
   
   - It is manifest that the court which has been given the duty to supervise domestic relations matters, including alimony judgments and orders pursuant thereto, must have the authority to enforce those judgments and orders. This is true whether the judgment was entered in the superior court or the district court. It would be anomalous to assume that when the legislature changed the statutory framework to make the district court division the proper agency in which to bring actions for alimony or actions to enforce alimony judgments, it meant to leave supervision of prior alimony judgments to the superior court. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 174 S.E.2d 2 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Enforcement of Judgment Entered in Superior Court Before Establishment of District Court.
   
   - The district court has the power to enforce by a civil contempt proceeding a confession of judgment entered in the superior court before the establishment of the district court allowing alimony to an appellee. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 174 S.E.2d 2 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Transfer of Action for Absolute Divorce Which Has Ended in Mistrial.
   
   - The superior court has authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va21s7A-259" target="_self">G.S. 7A-259</a></cite> to transfer to the district court an action for absolute divorce which has twice ended in mistrial in the superior court and this section gives the district court jurisdiction to try the action. Pence v. Pence, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 174 S.E.2d 860 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An order for the payment of alimony is not a final judgment,
   
   since it may be modified upon application of either party; thus, an action for alimony would continue to be "pending" in the court of proper jurisdiction, which is now the district court. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 174 S.E.2d 2 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court had no authority to partition marital property pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.046.html#t46a01s46-1" target="_blank">G.S. 46-1</a></cite>, et seq., where
   
   the jurisdiction of the district court had been properly invoked to equitably distribute such marital property. Garrison v. Garrison, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 369 S.E.2d 628 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the parties invoked the jurisdiction of the district court to equitably distribute their marital property in the action for absolute divorce and equitable distribution of their marital property, the district court did not lose jurisdiction to equitably distribute the marital property because of its failure to enter a judgment in the equitable distribution case before the special proceeding seeking partition of the marital property was filed in the office of the clerk of superior court. Garrison v. Garrison, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 369 S.E.2d 628 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an action dealing with marital property distribution had been previously filed in district court and another action relating to the same subject matter was then filed in superior court, the district court's jurisdiction over the subject matter had already been invoked, and the superior court did not have jurisdiction in the subsequently filed action. Hudson Int'l, Inc. v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. App.</cite> 631, 550 S.E.2d 571 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A hearing on a motion in the cause requesting a modification of a child support order is a "trial"
   
   within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa18s7A-198" target="_self">G.S. 7A-198</a></cite>. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 374 S.E.2d 467 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of Certiorari.
   
   - Given the necessity for the court of appeals to address the "prior pending action" issue on the merits and given the interrelated nature of the twin challenges to the trial court's order denying the motion of a former wife, trustee, and family trust to dismiss a former husband's action based on the exclusive jurisdiction provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va20s7A-244" target="_self">G.S. 7A-244</a></cite>, the court of appeals exercised its authority to treat the record on appeal and briefs as a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari with respect to the exclusive jurisdiction issue and issue the writ on its own motion pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIa05s7A-32ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7A-32(c)</a></cite> and N.C. R. App. P. 21 in order to reach the merits of both of the challenges to the trial court's order; as a result, the court of appeals addressed the claims of the wife, trustee, and trust on the merits. Jessee v. Jessee, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 713 S.E.2d 28 (2011).

        Motion To Dismiss Based On Exclusive Jurisdiction Properly Denied.
   
   - Trial court correctly denied a motion to dismiss a Forsyth County action based on the exclusive jurisdiction provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va20s7A-244" target="_self">G.S. 7A-244</a></cite> because a former husband was not barred from asserting compensatory and punitive damage claims against his former wife, a trustee, and a family trust relating to converted Social Security checks and debts separately and apart from an Alamance County domestic case since the claims asserted in the Forsyth County action related to property allegedly accumulated and debts allegedly incurred after the date the husband and wife separated; the extent to which the wife and trustee utilized impermissibly obtained funds to obtain clear title to and then fraudulently transferred the unencumbered former marital residence to the trust had little, if anything, to do with claims between the husband and wife as to the value of that asset and the extent to which and manner in which it was subject to distribution between the parties pursuant to the Equitable Distribution Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-20" target="_blank">G.S. 50-20</a></cite> Jessee v.

       <p>
        Jurisdiction of injunctive relief generally is vested concurrently in the superior court division and the district court division,
   
   because even the four types of injunctive relief which the legislature suggested should be heard in the superior court division are not confined jurisdictionally to that division; the statute merely specifies that the superior court division is the proper division for the trial of such actions. Boston v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 736, 171 S.E.2d 206 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (b) of this section a prayer for injunctive relief of any of the types enumerated in subsection (a) is not even grounds for transfer to the superior court division unless such injunctive relief is prayed for by a party plaintiff. So it is abundantly clear that the district court division has jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief in cases docketed in that division. Boston v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 736, 171 S.E.2d 206 (1969).

        Injunction Not Warranted.
   
   - The plaintiff, who sued when he was reinstated as Internal Auditor II, rather than Chief of the Internal Audit Section for DOT, was not entitled to an injunction where the DOT showed that it would be harmed if the position of Chief Internal Auditor could not be filled with anyone other than plaintiff because the section's operations would be disrupted, and the DOT would be unfairly restricted in management of its own operations; additionally, the plaintiff, reinstated in a similar position at same pay grade, was unable to show financial loss or irreparable injury.

        Jurisdiction.
   
   - Where an adoption proceeding was filed before the child's father filed an action for custody, In order to avoid unresolvable conflicts, the trial court had to decline to exercise its jurisdiction in the custody action while the adoption proceeding was pending by holding the custody action in abeyance. Johns v. Welker, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 177, 744 S.E.2d 486 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in dismissing a father's action for custody of his son, as it did not lack subject matter jurisdiction due to a prior pending adoption proceeding involving the son; the "prior pending action" doctrine did not apply, as the parties were not the same in both actions and they did not request the same relief.

But this strict construction would ignore the "according to the practice and procedure provided by law" mandate of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va20s7A-241" target="_self">G.S. 7A-241</a></cite>. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 229, 221 S.E.2d 370, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541 (1976).

       <p>
        Allocation of Jurisdiction Between Clerk and Judge.
   
   - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va20s7A-241" target="_self">G.S. 7A-241</a></cite> does not say that concurrent jurisdiction in probate matters is vested in the clerk and the judge of the superior court. It says that probate jurisdiction is vested in the superior court division to be exercised by the superior court and the clerk according to the practice and procedure provided by law. The law, that is, the statutes specifying this practice and procedure, has allocated the jurisdiction between the clerk and the judge. By <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa02s28A-2-1" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-2-1</a></cite> the clerk is given exclusive original jurisdiction of "the administration, settlement and distribution of estates of decedents" except in cases where the clerk is disqualified to act under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa02s28A-2-3" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-2-3</a></cite>. When the clerk is disqualified to exercise his jurisdiction the judge has equal authority to perform the clerk's probate duties and, in that sense, he exercises concurrent jurisdiction of probate matters. In all other instances, however, the judge's probate jurisdiction is, in effect, that of an appellate court pursuant to this section. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Entry of Order Necessary to Vest Judge With Jurisdiction.
   
   - Entry of the clerk's order was necessary to vest a judge with jurisdiction to hear the appeal in superior court, and no entry of final judgment on the merits of prior motions occurred such that the issues before another judge were barred by res judicata. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 754 S.E.2d 168 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Submission of Issue Involving Probate and Nonprobate Matters.
   
   - The judge of superior court in the exercise of his inherent powers upon appeal from the clerk's finding had the right to submit to the jury the one issue that would resolve both the right to qualify as administratrix, which was a probate matter, and the right to share in the decedent's estate, which was not a probate matter. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 229, 221 S.E.2d 370, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Request for Appointed Counsel.
   
   - Contemnor's appeal of an order affirming a clerk's denial of a request for appointed counsel was not considered because the contemnor did not (1) appear at the contempt hearing, (2) seek a ruling on the contemnor's motion for counsel, or (3) move to continue the hearing. Tyll v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 758 S.E.2d 411 (2014).

     <p>
      All civil actions and proceedings in the General Court of Justice are instituted in, and the original records thereof are maintained in, the office of the clerk of superior court, without regard to the trial divisions in which the cause is pending from time to time. When the commencement of an action or proceeding requires issuance of summons, the clerk of superior court issues the summons, and such summons runs and is valid as general process of the State without regard to the trial division in which the action or proceeding may be pending from time to time.

      "(3) Identify any potential issues that may arise in the development of the system and plans for mitigating those issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Address the potential for incorporating any currently existing resources into the e-Courts system.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) The Administrative Office of the Courts shall report quarterly beginning November 1, 2015, to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Justice and Public Safety and the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Information Technology on the development, implementation, and specific costs of the strategic plan required by subsection (a) of this section and on any changes in the projected costs for implementing the e-Courts system or the schedule for implementation. The report shall also provide an accounting of the use of funds appropriated in this act for development of the e-Courts initiative.

      "(e) As a precursor to the implementation of its e-Courts initiative, the Administrative Office of the Courts shall establish a pilot program in New Hanover County for the online collection and payment of court costs, fines, and related fees, with the potential of expanding the program statewide at the conclusion of a successful pilot. The costs incurred by the programs established pursuant to this section shall be borne by vendors selected by the Administrative Office of the Courts. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall report by March 1, 2016, to the chairs of the Joint Legislative Committee on Justice and Public Safety and the chairs of the House of Representatives and Senate Appropriations Committees on Justice and Public Safety on the pilot program established pursuant to this section and its plans to expand the program statewide."

       Any party, including the plaintiff, may move on notice to all parties to transfer the civil action or special proceeding to the proper division when the division in which the case is pending is improper under the rules stated in this Subchapter. A motion to transfer to another division may also be made if all parties to the action or proceeding consent thereto, and if the judge deems the transfer will facilitate the efficient administration of justice.

       A motion to transfer is filed in the action or proceeding sought to be transferred, but it is heard and determined by a judge of the superior court division whether the case is pending in that division or not. A superior court judge who has jurisdiction under G.S. 7A-47.1 or G.S. 7A-48 in the district or set of districts as defined in G.S. 7A-41.1(a) in which the county is located, may hear and determine such motion. The motion is heard and determined in a county within that district or set of districts, except by consent of the parties.

       A motion to transfer by any party other than the plaintiff must be filed within 30 days after the moving party is served with a copy of the pleading which justifies transfer. A motion to transfer by the plaintiff, if based upon the pleading of any other party, must be filed within 20 days after the pleading has been filed. A motion to transfer by any party, based upon an amendment to his own pleading must be made not later than 10 days after such amendment is filed. In no event is a motion to transfer made or determined after the case has been called for trial. Failure to move for transfer within the required time is a waiver of any objection to the division in which the case is pending, except in matters of probate of wills or administration of decedents' estates.
      </li>

         A statement by an attorney for the moving party, or if the party is not represented by counsel, a statement by the party that the motion is made in the good faith belief that it may be properly granted and that he intends no amendment which would affect propriety of transfer.

       Objection to the jurisdiction of the court over person or property is waived when a motion to transfer is filed unless such objection is raised at the time of filing or before. In no other case does the filing of a motion to transfer waive any rights under other motions or pleadings, nor does it prevent the filing of other motions or pleadings, except as provided in Rule 12 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.

       Transfer is effected when an order of transfer is filed. When transfer is ordered, the clerk makes appropriate entries on the dockets of each division and transfers the file of the case to the new division. No further proceedings are taken in the division from which the case is transferred. Papers filed after a transfer are properly filed notwithstanding any erroneous reference to the division from which the case is transferred. All orders made prior to transfer including restraining orders, remain effective after transfer, as if no transfer had been made, until modified or set aside in the division to which the case is transferred.

      When a change of venue is ordered by consent while a motion to transfer is pending, the motion to transfer is determined in the new venue.

      </h4>
      <p>
       There is no such thing as an oral motion to transfer.
   
   East Carolina Farm Credit v. Salter, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 439 S.E.2d 610 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Party May Move for Transfer of Case as Matter of Right.
   
   - Although the case allocations of this Chapter are merely administrative directives, a party may move, as a matter of right, for transfer of a case in accordance with the proper statutory allocation. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 448</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 30 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Except Where Case Has Reached Trial Stage.
   
   - The General Assembly did not intend that cases called for trial or cases already tried and reduced to judgment be transferred under this section as a matter of right. Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 448</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 30 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Because this section clearly applies only to cases in the pleading stage.
   
   Stanback v. Stanback, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 448</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 30 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       But where a matter is properly in the district court, a party is not entitled to move for a transfer to superior court.
   
   Thus, the prohibition contained in subdivision (f)(1) of this section against involuntary dismissal of an action in which a motion to transfer is pending would not apply. Brooks v. Gooden, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 318 S.E.2d 348 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to transfer may be waived by consent or by failure to move for transfer
   
   within the prescribed time limits. Amey v. Amey, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 321 S.E.2d 458 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an action was improperly brought in the district court, the parties could have moved pursuant to this section to transfer the case to the proper division while the case was pending in the improper division; however, the parties waived this right after the case had been called for trial, and the defect was not jurisdictional. Parslow v. Parslow, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 266 S.E.2d 746 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Pending Motion to Transfer.
   
   - Under subsection (f) of this section, the filing of a motion to transfer does not stay further proceedings in the case, except that: (1) Involuntary dismissal is not ordered while a motion to transfer is pending; and (2) Assignment to a magistrate is not ordered while a motion to transfer is pending. Amey v. Amey, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 321 S.E.2d 458 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether to proceed in an action pending a motion to transfer rests within the sound discretion of the court.
   
   Langley v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 307 S.E.2d 817 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly denied a corporation's motion to dismiss claims against it, including negligence and breach of express and implied warranties, because N.C. R. Civ. P. 12 and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va21s7A-258ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7A-258(f)</a></cite> established that the corporation, by filing a motion to transfer two months prior to its Rule 12(b)(2) motion, waived defenses under Rule 12(b)(2). State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Durapro, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 713 S.E.2d 1 (2011).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Grant of Subsequent Motions While Motion to Transfer Was Pending Held Error.
   
   - By striking the answer and dismissing counterclaims under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 12(b)(6), the district court in effect entered two "involuntary dismissals." Therefore, the district court erred, as it considered plaintiff's substantive, and subsequently filed, motions, before ruling on defendant's earlier filed motion to transfer. Amey v. Amey, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 321 S.E.2d 458 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Action Instituted in Superior Court Prior to Establishment of District Court.
   
   - Where an action was instituted in the superior court prior to the establishment of the district court in the county, and where no order was ever entered transferring the action from the superior court to the district court, a district court judge was without jurisdiction to enter an order in the action. Hodge v. Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 176 S.E.2d 795 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The district court had no authority to modify a child-custody order entered in the superior court where the cause was pending in the superior court when district courts were established in the county, and where no order had been entered in the superior court transferring the cause to the district court pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va21s7A-259" target="_self">G.S. 7A-259</a></cite>, nor had a motion to transfer been made pursuant to this section.

       If no party has moved for transfer within the time allowed to parties, any superior court judge who may hear and determine motions to transfer may order a transfer upon his own motion for the purpose of efficient administration of the trial divisions at any time before the case is calendared for trial. Transfer is not made on the judge's own motion unless the pleadings clearly show that the case is pending in an improper division. No hearing is held on such transfers, but the parties are given prompt notice when transfer is effected. Nothing in this section affects the power of the clerk to transfer matters and proceedings pending before him when an issue of fact is raised.

       When a district court is established in a district, any superior court judge authorized to hear and determine motions to transfer may, on his own motion, subject to the requirements of subsection (a), transfer to the district court cases pending in the superior court.

       Jurisdiction of District Court.
   
   - Under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-271" target="_self">G.S. 7A-271</a></cite>, the district court has original jurisdiction for the trial of all criminal actions below the grade of felony, that is, of all prosecutions for misdemeanors; and the district court has exclusive original jurisdiction of all misdemeanors except in the four specific instances defined in subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4) of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-271" target="_self">G.S. 7A-271</a></cite>.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction of General Court of Justice.
   
   - Trial court did not err in denying an insurer's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because an employee's claims for malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and unfair and deceptive trade practices did not fall within the scope of the Workers' Compensation Act; the employee's tort claims concerned the initiation and continued pursuit of a criminal prosecution, not a workers' compensation claim, and thus, they were properly before the general court of justice. Seguro-Suarez v. Key Risk Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 200, 819 S.E.2d 741 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       When, after the Workers' Compensation Commission awards an injured worker benefits, an employer's insurance company knowingly provides false information to police to frame him or her for insurance fraud, resulting in his or her arrest, incarceration, and indictment on felony charges, the worker's claims for malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and unfair and deceptive trade practices exceed the scope of the Workers' Compensation Act and are properly before the General Court of Justice. Seguro-Suarez v. Key Risk Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 200, 819 S.E.2d 741 (2018).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       State Has Burden to Show Jurisdiction.
   
   - When jurisdiction is challenged in a criminal case, the State must carry the burden and show beyond a reasonable doubt that North Carolina has jurisdiction to try the accused. Former cases holding that a challenge to the jurisdiction is an affirmative defense with the burden of persuasion on the accused are no longer authoritative. State v. Batdorf, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 486</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 497 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of jurisdiction of the courts in this State in a criminal case is not an independent, distinct, substantive matter of exemption, immunity or defense and ought not to be regarded as an affirmative defense on which the defendant must bear the burden of proof. Rather, jurisdiction is a matter which, when contested, should be proven by the prosecution as a prerequisite to the authority of the court to enter judgment. State v. Batdorf, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 486</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 497 (1977).

       § 7A-271. Jurisdiction of superior court.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1a">
       The superior court has exclusive, original jurisdiction over all criminal actions not assigned to the district court division by this Article, except that the superior court has jurisdiction to try a misdemeanor:
       <ol>
        <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1a1">
         Which is a lesser included offense of a felony on which an indictment has been returned, or a felony information as to which an indictment has been properly waived; or
        </li>
        <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1a2">
         When the charge is initiated by presentment; or
        </li>
        <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1a3">
         Which may be properly consolidated for trial with a felony under G.S. 15A-926;
        </li>
        <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1a4">
         To which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is tendered in lieu of a felony charge; or
        </li>
        <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1a5">
         When a misdemeanor conviction is appealed to the superior court for trial de novo, to accept a guilty plea to a lesser included or related charge.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1b">
       Appeals by the State or the defendant from the district court are to the superior court. The jurisdiction of the superior court over misdemeanors appealed from the district court to the superior court for trial de novo is the same as the district court had in the first instance, and when that conviction resulted from a plea arrangement between the defendant and the State pursuant to which misdemeanor charges were dismissed, reduced, or modified, to try those charges in the form and to the extent that they subsisted in the district court immediately prior to entry of the defendant and the State of the plea arrangement.
      </li>
      <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1c">
       When a district court is established in a district, any superior court judge presiding over a criminal session of court shall order transferred to the district court any pending misdemeanor which does not fall within the provisions of subsection (a), and which is not pending in the superior court on appeal from a lower court.
      </li>
      <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1d">
       The criminal jurisdiction of the superior court includes the jurisdiction to dispose of infractions only in the following circumstances:
       <ol>
        <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1d1">
         If the infraction is a lesser-included violation of a criminal action properly before the court, the court must submit the infraction for the jury's consideration in factually appropriate cases.
        </li>
        <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1d2">
         If the infraction is a lesser-included violation of a criminal action properly before the court, or if it is a related charge, the court may accept admissions of responsibility for the infraction. A proper pleading for the criminal action is sufficient to support a finding of responsibility for the lesser-included infraction.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1e">
       The superior court has exclusive jurisdiction over all hearings held pursuant to G.S. 15A-1345(e) where the district court had accepted a defendant's plea of guilty or no contest to a felony under the provisions of G.S. 7A-272(c), except that the district court shall have jurisdiction to hear these matters with the consent of the State and the defendant.
      </li>
      <li id="t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1f">
       The superior court has exclusive jurisdiction over all hearings to revoke probation pursuant to G.S. 15A-1345(e) where the district court is supervising a drug treatment court or therapeutic court probation judgment under G.S. 7A-272(e), except that the district court has jurisdiction to conduct the revocation proceedings when the chief district court judge and the senior resident superior court judge agree that it is in the interest of justice that the proceedings be conducted by the district court. If the district court exercises jurisdiction under this subsection to revoke probation, appeal of an order revoking probation is to the appellate division.

         I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Appeals in Civil Causes Distinguished from Appeals in Criminal Causes.
   
   - The constitutional and statutory structure of the General Court of Justice provides that, generally, appeals from the district court in civil causes go to the Court of Appeals, while appeals in criminal causes must first go to the superior court. State v. Killian, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 212 S.E.2d 419 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction Based on Plea Agreement.
   
   - This section sets forth an express exception where the conviction appealed from is the product of a plea agreement. State v. Monroe, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 597, 292 S.E.2d 21 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        State Has Burden to Show Jurisdiction.
   
   - When jurisdiction is challenged in a criminal case, the State must carry the burden and show beyond a reasonable doubt that North Carolina has jurisdiction to try the accused. Former cases holding that a challenge to the jurisdiction is an affirmative defense with the burden of persuasion on the accused are no longer authoritative. State v. Batdorf, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 486</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 497 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of jurisdiction of the courts in this State in a criminal case is not an independent, distinct, substantive matter of exemption, immunity or defense and ought not to be regarded as an affirmative defense on which the defendant must bear the burden of proof. Rather, jurisdiction is a matter which, when contested, should be proven by the prosecution as a prerequisite to the authority of the court to enter judgment. State v. Batdorf, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 486</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 497 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When the record shows a lack of jurisdiction in the lower court,
   
   the appropriate action on the part of the appellate court is to arrest judgment or vacate any order entered without authority. State v. Felmet, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 173</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 708 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Presumption of Regular Procedure.
   
   - On appeal to the superior court from a conviction in the district court, a presumption of regular procedure in the district court can be inferred. State v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 361, 235 S.E.2d 107 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The entire record may be considered on appeal
   
   to the superior court from a conviction in the district court in searching for evidence that proper procedure was followed. State v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 361, 235 S.E.2d 107 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The imposition of a greater sentence after a conviction by a jury in the superior court,
   
   upon appeal from a district court, does not violate a defendant's constitutional rights. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 192 S.E.2d 596 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The offense of habitual impaired driving
   
   constitutes a separate substantive felony offense which is properly within the original exclusive jurisdiction of the superior court. State v. Priddy, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 445 S.E.2d 610, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 805</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 751 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because felonious habitual impaired driving is a substantive felony offense, the Superior Court has jurisdiction pursuant to this section. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 713, 453 S.E.2d 193 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal of District Court's Judgment Revoking Probation
   
   - Defendant was required to appeal the district court's judgment revoking his probation to the superior court before he was allowed to appeal that judgment to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals dismissed defendant's appeal from the district court's judgment because he had not appealed that judgment to the superior court. State v. Harless, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 584 S.E.2d 339 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a district court revokes a defendant's probation, that defendant's appeal is to the superior court rather than the Court of Appeals of North Carolina; thus, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIIa82s15A-1347" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1347</a></cite>, rather than <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-272ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-272(d)</a></cite>, governed defendant's appeal of a probation revocation and the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. State v. Hooper, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 122</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 514 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence Contrary to Law Still Binding and Not Void Ab Initio.
   
   - Since the superior court had exclusive, original jurisdiction over defendant's motion for appropriate relief and had ordered that defendant's sentences on guilty pleas to armed robbery be served concurrently and not consecutively, the Department of Corrections could not refuse to obey an order to change defendant's records to reflect concurrent sentencing because, even though the sentencing order was contrary to law, the order was voidable, not void ab initio, and the order was binding on the Department until vacated or corrected; by refusing to honor the order, the Department was usurping the judiciary's exclusive power and was violating the separation of powers doctrine under N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   6. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 276, 605 S.E.2d 168 (2004), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 200</cite>, 639 S.E.2d 425 (2007) (remanded to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        District Court Jurisdiction.
   
   - While the State implicitly abandons its prosecution in district court when it proceeds to trial in superior court and acknowledges its intent on the record not to proceed in district court, that rule does not apply where the superior court failed to even exercise jurisdiction. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 822 S.E.2d 902 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        District Court Lacked Jurisdiction.
   
   - County district court lacked the jurisdiction to accept defendant's pleas and enter the underlying probationary judgments in the county felony cases where <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-272ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7A-272(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Xa58As15A-1029.1" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1029.1</a></cite>, which authorized the acceptance of guilty or no contest pleas to felony offenses in the district court division, either assumed or required the return of a bill of indictment or the filing of an information, but an indictment was never returned and an information was never filed in the subject cases. State v. McCulloch, - N.C. App.
   - , 756 S.E.2d 361 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior Courts Have Subject Matter Jurisdiction To Determine Eligibility For Satellite-Based Monitoring.
   
   - Trial court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa27As14-208.40" target="_blank">G.S. 14-208.40</a></cite>A and followed the proper hearing procedures in assessing defendant's eligibility for satellite-based monitoring because the trial court determined that defendant was convicted of a reportable offense, statutory sex offense of a person at least six years younger than defendant pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa7As14-27.7" target="_blank">G.S. 14-27.7</a></cite>A(a), considered the assessment prepared by the North Carolina Department of Correction and the testimony of the witnesses; the General Assembly devised a separate procedure for determining eligibility for satellite-based monitoring and clearly granted the superior courts subject matter jurisdiction to conduct these determinations pursuant to specific statutory procedures. State v. Jarvis, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 715 S.E.2d 252 (2011).

         Petition for Writ of Mandamus.
        </b>
        - From a final judgment entered in Wake County District Court, appeal of right was to Wake County Superior Court; thus, a petition for writ of mandamus would be properly have been with the Superior Court, not with the North Carolina Court of Appeals. State v. Diaz-Tomas, - N.C. App.

        Jurisdiction of Superior Court over Misdemeanors.
   
   - The superior court may try a misdemeanor when the conviction is appealed from the district court to the superior court for trial de novo, but has no jurisdiction to try a defendant upon warrants charging misdemeanors, where defendant has not first been tried upon the warrants in the district court and appealed to the superior court. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 544, 174 S.E.2d 872 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a prosecution was instituted under statutes which created misdemeanors, for which the district court has exclusive, original jurisdiction, until defendants were tried and convicted in the district court and appealed to the superior court for a trial de novo that court had no jurisdiction of the case. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 407</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 854 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The superior court has no jurisdiction to try an accused for a specific misdemeanor on the warrant of an inferior court unless he is first tried and convicted for such misdemeanor in the inferior court and appeals to the superior court from the sentence pronounced against him by the inferior court on his conviction for such misdemeanor. State v. Craig, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 51, 203 S.E.2d 401 (1974); State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 253 S.E.2d 311 (1979); State v. Felmet, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 173</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 708 (1981); State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 387 S.E.2d 211 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Superior Courts of North Carolina have exclusive original jurisdiction over all criminal actions not assigned to the district court division except that the superior courts have jurisdiction to try a misdemeanor offense where (1) it is a lesser included offense of a felony properly before the court by indictment or information, (2) the charge is initiated by presentment, (3) the misdemeanor is properly consolidated for trial with a felony, (4) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is tendered in lieu of a felony charge, or (5) a misdemeanor conviction is appealed for trial de novo, to accept a guilty plea to a lesser included or related charge. State v. Petersilie, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 414 S.E.2d 41 (1992), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 169</cite>, 432 S.E.2d 832 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because misdemeanor charges were not included in an indictment, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIXa49s15A-922ol1g" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-922(g)</a></cite>, a superior court did not have jurisdiction to try them under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-271" target="_self">G.S. 7A-271</a></cite>. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 611 S.E.2d 891 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's challenge to the trial court's jurisdiction was without merit because the citation issued to defendant on July 27, 2013, sufficiently identified the crime charged - transporting an open container of fortified wine or spirituous liquor while operating a motor vehicle - and put defendant on notice of the charge; and because defendant was tried on the citation at issue without objection in the district court, and by a jury in the superior court on a trial de novo; and, once jurisdiction was established and defendant was tried in the district court, defendant was no longer in a position to assert his statutory right to object to a trial on a citation. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 783 S.E.2d 799 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Derivative Jurisdiction.
   
   - Jurisdiction of the superior court on appeal from a conviction in district court is derivative. State v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 361, 235 S.E.2d 107 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jurisdiction of the superior court for the trial of a misdemeanor, unless a circumstance enumerated in subsection (a) of this section arises, is derivative and arises only upon appeal from a conviction of the misdemeanor in district court. State v. Felmet, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 173</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 708 (1981); State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 387 S.E.2d 211 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Dismissal of Appeal for Failure to Show Jurisdiction.
   
   - The Court of Appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to amend the record to show derivative jurisdiction of a misdemeanor in the superior court through appeal of a district court conviction and then dismissing defendant's appeal for failure of the record to show jurisdiction. State v. Felmet, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 173</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 708 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Court of Appeals orders that a new trial be held in a misdemeanor prosecution
   
   originally tried in a municipal court and then tried de novo in the superior court, the case on retrial maintains its status as a case pending in the superior court on appeal from a lower court, and defendant's motion to quash the indictment on the ground that the district court has jurisdiction of the case is properly denied. State v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 164, 167 S.E.2d 821 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Issuing Second Warrant Charging Same Offense.
   
   - Where defendant was tried and convicted in district court, appealed to superior court, and subsequently moved to dismiss the charge pursuant to the former Speedy Trial Act, former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsVIIa35s15A-701" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-701</a></cite> through 15A-704, the court allowed defendant's motion and ordered dismissal of the case without prejudice; on that same day the magistrate issued a new warrant charging the same offense; and the trial judge, later during the same session, reopened the matter, heard additional evidence and arguments, and dismissed the case without prejudice to the State, the superior court was not divested of jurisdiction by the magistrate's issuing the second warrant, nor did the State, by securing the second warrant, waive whatever rights to appellate review it might have had. State v. Morehead, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 264 S.E.2d 400, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 201</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 615 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Presentment And Indictment Invalid.
   
   - Superior court properly ruled that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear defendant's case because the presentment and indictment were invalid; because the prosecutor submitted the presentment and the indictment to the grand jury simultaneously, and they were returned by the grand jury simultaneously, each was rendered invalid as a matter of law. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 822 S.E.2d 902 (2018).

       <p>
        Error for Superior Court to Instruct on Specific Misdemeanor Not Tried in District Court.
   
   - The trial judge, on trial de novo in the superior court, erred in instructing the jury on reckless driving under subsection (a) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-140" target="_blank">G.S. 20-140</a></cite> and should have instructed on former subsection (c) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-140" target="_blank">G.S. 20-140</a></cite>, where the defendant had been charged in the district court with drunken driving under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-138" target="_blank">G.S. 20-138</a></cite> (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-138.1" target="_blank">G.S. 20-138.1</a></cite>) but was convicted of the lesser included offense under former subsection (c) of G.S. 20-140.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Case Remanded for Order Transferring Case.
   
   - Because the superior court was without jurisdiction, the case was remanded to the superior court to enter an order transferring the case to the district court; the superior court failed to attain jurisdiction over defendant, and the prosecutor made clear that the district court case was never dismissed. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 822 S.E.2d 902 (2018).

       <p>
        "Presentment" Defined.
   
   - In this jurisdiction, the accepted definition of the word "presentment" is as follows: "A presentment is an accusation of crime made by a grand jury on its own motion upon its own knowledge or observation, or upon information from others without any bill of indictment, but, since the enactment of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html#t15a14s15-137" target="_blank">G.S. 15-137</a></cite> (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsVIa32s15A-641" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-641</a></cite>), trials upon presentments have been abolished and a presentment amounts to nothing more than an instruction by the grand jury to the public prosecuting attorney to frame a bill of indictment." State v. Wall, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 675</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 363 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Initiated" Construed.
   
   - The term "initiated" refers to how the criminal process in superior court began, not to what the first criminal process of any kind in any court was. State v. Gunter, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 621, 433 S.E.2d 191, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 561</cite>, 439 S.E.2d 154 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Language of Presentment and Indictment May Differ.
   
   - Where the language of the presentment and that contained in the bills of indictment, while not identical, dealt with the same subject matter and the charges contained in the bills were in fact initiated by the presentment, the superior court had original jurisdiction under this section. State v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 304</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 355 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Initiation Not Shown.
   
   - A prosecution for violation of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-105" target="_blank">G.S. 20-105</a></cite> governing unauthorized use of a conveyance was not "initiated by presentment" within the meaning of subdivision (a)(2). Although the prerequisites to conviction for the felony charged in the warrant and the misdemeanor charged in the indictment were different, the prosecution for the alleged criminal conduct of defendant in respect of the alleged unlawful taking of a car was initiated by warrant issued by the district court. It was not initiated in the superior court by presentment or otherwise. State v. Wall, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 675</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 363 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The superior court had neither exclusive original jurisdiction of the misdemeanors under subdivisions (a)(1)-(5) of this section, nor derivative jurisdiction under subsection (b) where the record indicated that defendant's arrest sprang from indictments issued by the grand jury which originated in the superior court, and there was no indication in the record that a presentment preceded the indictments. State v. Petersilie, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 414 S.E.2d 41 (1992), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 169</cite>, 432 S.E.2d 832 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction in Superior Court Shown.
   
   - This section grants jurisdiction to the superior court in any action already properly pending in the district court if the grand jury issues a presentment and that presentment is the first accusation of the offense within superior court. Therefore, defendant's driving while impaired (DWI) action was properly under the jurisdiction of the district court and not the superior court when the citation was issued, but as soon as the grand jury issued the presentment, the superior court acquired jurisdiction. State v. Gunter, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 621, 433 S.E.2d 191, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 561</cite>, 439 S.E.2d 154 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The amended record contained a certified copy of the presentment issued by the grand jury and filed with the superior court. Thus, because the misdemeanor stalking charge against defendant was properly initiated by a presentment, the superior court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the case. State v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 60, 819 S.E.2d 397 (2018), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 793</cite>, 821 S.E.2d 173, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 1082 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction because it acquired jurisdiction over the offense after the indictment issued since the charge was initiated by presentment; the State had abandoned its prosecution in district court to the exclusion of its superior court prosecution, which effectively served as the functional equivalent of a dismissal of the district court charge, rendering it no longer valid and pending. State v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 466, 822 S.E.2d 456 (2018).

        A "driving under the influence" misdemeanor charge and a manslaughter felony charge were based on the same transaction
   
   within the meaning of subdivision (a)(3). And therefore the superior court had jurisdiction of both charges and had the right to proceed to the trial on the misdemeanor charge under the joinder exception of this section, the "original jurisdiction" of the district court having been lost after nolle prosequi was entered as to the misdemeanor in that court. State v. Karbas, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 221 S.E.2d 98, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 618</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 394 (1976).

        Death by Vehicle and Failure to Stop at Scene of Accident.
   
   - In a prosecution on separate bills of indictment for failing to stop an automobile at the scene of an accident in which an individual was killed (G.S. 20-166(a)) and death by vehicle (G.S. 20-141.4), where the two offenses were based on the same act or transaction, the superior court had jurisdiction of the misdemeanor offense of death by vehicle.

        Larceny charge arising out of the theft of a license plate from a car parked next to a video store was properly joined with a felony breaking and entering charge arising out of defendant's theft of the contents of a safe in the video store as part of the same transaction, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIXa49s15A-926ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-926(a)</a></cite>, and the superior court had jurisdiction over both charges under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-271(a)</a></cite>.

        Dismissal of Felony Following Consolidation.
   
   - Superior court did not properly have subject matter jurisdiction because, while the State properly joined a felony, a misdemeanor, and an infraction for trial, when the State dismissed the felony charge, the misdemeanor and the infraction fell under none of the statutory exceptions, and the superior court should have transferred the two remaining charges to the district court.

   - The warrant on which defendant was arrested and bound over to superior court charged a felony, to wit, the larceny of an automobile valued at more than $200.00, and the indictment charged a misdemeanor, to wit, a violation of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-105" target="_blank">G.S. 20-105</a></cite>, the "temporary larceny" statute. Since defendant, in the superior court, was not tried for or charged with any felony, subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section did not apply to the criminal prosecution for the violation of former G.S. 20-105.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        State Has Burden to Show Jurisdiction.
   
   - The question of jurisdiction of the courts in this State in a criminal case is not an independent, distinct, substantive matter of exemption, immunity or defense and ought not to be regarded as an affirmative defense on which the defendant must bear the burden of proof. Rather, jurisdiction is a matter which, when contested, should be proven by the prosecution as a prerequisite to the authority of the court to enter judgment. State v. Batdorf, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 486</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 497 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        When jurisdiction is challenged, in a criminal case, the State must carry the burden and show beyond a reasonable doubt that North Carolina has jurisdiction to try the accused. Former cases holding that a challenge to the jurisdiction is an affirmative defense with the burden of persuasion on the accused are no longer authoritative. State v. Batdorf, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 486</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 497 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>

State v. Hooper, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 654, 582 S.E.2d 331 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction over a District Court's Revocation of Probation.
   
   - When a district court revokes a defendant's probation, that defendant's appeal is to the superior court rather than the Court of Appeals of North Carolina; thus, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIIa82s15A-1347" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1347</a></cite>, rather than <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-272ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-272(d)</a></cite>, governed defendant's appeal of a probation revocation and the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. State v. Hooper, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 122</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 514 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        County district court lacked the jurisdiction to accept defendant's pleas and enter the underlying probationary judgments in the county felony cases where <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-272ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7A-272(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Xa58As15A-1029.1" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1029.1</a></cite>, which authorized the acceptance of guilty or no contest pleas to felony offenses in the district court division, either assumed or required the return of a bill of indictment or the filing of an information, but an indictment was never returned and an information was never filed in the subject cases. State v. McCulloch, - N.C. App.
   - , 756 S.E.2d 361 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate Jurisdiction.
   
   - Superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review a district court judgment on a misdemeanor driving while impaired (DWI) charge against defendant; once defendant appealed, the superior court obtained jurisdiction over the DWI charge and was required to treat the case like other misdemeanor appeals. State v. Petty, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 711 S.E.2d 509 (2011).

         II. JURISDICTION OVER MISDEMEANORS.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The district court has exclusive original jurisdiction of misdemeanors,
   
   including actions to determine liability of persons for the support of dependents in any criminal proceeding. Cline v. Cline, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 170 S.E.2d 645 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a prosecution was instituted under statutes which created misdemeanors, for which the district court had exclusive, original jurisdiction, until defendants were tried and convicted in the district court and appealed to the superior court for a trial de novo that court had no jurisdiction of the case. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 407</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 854 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is fundamental that the district courts of this state have exclusive original jurisdiction of misdemeanors, and the jurisdiction of the superior court is derivative and arises only upon an appeal from a conviction of the misdemeanor in the district court. State v. McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 261 S.E.2d 226, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 546</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 405 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Court Is Without Jurisdiction to Impose Sentence for Felony.
   
   - District courts are without jurisdiction to impose sentences in felony cases. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 75, 187 S.E.2d 470 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        What Jurisdictional Issues May Arise.
   
   - Because the General Assembly has given the District Court Division statewide jurisdiction to hear misdemeanors, jurisdictional issues should arise only to determine: (1) whether North Carolina courts can hear the case, and (2) which division of the General Court of Justice must first try the matter. State v. Bolt, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 344 S.E.2d 51 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court had jurisdiction to try defendant for operating a motor vehicle with an open container of alcohol while alcohol remained in defendant's system because the citation issued to defendant identified the crime and stated defendant had an open container of alcohol after drinking, (2) defendant filed no motion objecting to the sufficiency of the offense charged in the citation, and (3) any failure to allege facts supporting every element of the offense was not a jurisdictional defect, as the North Carolina Constitution required no grand jury to make a probable cause determination for misdemeanors tried in district court as a jurisdictional prerequisite. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 805 S.E.2d 701 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 548</cite>, 819 S.E.2d 340, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 911 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Derivative Jurisdiction of Superior Court over Misdemeanors.
   
   - The jurisdiction of the superior court over a misdemeanor, unless a circumstance enumerated in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-271(a)</a></cite> arises, is a derivative and arises only upon appeal from a conviction of the misdemeanor in district court. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 387 S.E.2d 211 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, the superior court has no jurisdiction to try a defendant on a misdemeanor charge unless he was first tried, convicted and sentenced in district court and then appeals the judgment for a trial de novo in superior court. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 387 S.E.2d 211 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional right of a defendant charged with a misdemeanor to have a jury trial
   
   is not infringed by the fact that he has first to submit to trial without a jury in the district court and then appeal to superior court in order to obtain a jury trial. State v. Sherron, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 166 S.E.2d 836 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand for Jury Trial Not Ground for Removal.
   
   - Where, upon defendant's demand for a jury trial on a charge of driving without an operator's license, the district court ordered defendant to appear at the next session of superior court, the district judge apparently being of opinion that the defendant by moving for a jury trial could avoid trial in the district court and have his case transferred forthwith for trial in the superior court, the district court acted under a misapprehension of the law and erred by failing to proceed to trial of defendant for this criminal offense in accordance with the accusation contained in the warrant. State v. Wall, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 675</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 363 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Court of Appeals orders that a new trial be held in a misdemeanor prosecution
   
   originally tried in a municipal court and then tried de novo in the superior court, the case on retrial maintains its status as a case pending in the superior court on appeal from a lower court, and defendant's motion to quash the indictment on the ground that the district court has jurisdiction of the case is properly denied. State v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 164, 167 S.E.2d 821 (1969).

   - It was error to affirm a decision upholding an order granting defendant's motion to dismiss because a citation issued for driving while subject to an impairing substance tolled the statute of limitations, and the citation was a constitutionally and statutorily proper criminal pleading that conveyed jurisdiction to the district court to try defendant; because a citation could serve as the charging document for misdemeanors, the purpose of the statute of limitations was satisfied by its issuance. State v. Curtis, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 355</cite>, 817 S.E.2d 187 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Issuing Second Warrant Charging Same Offense.
   
   - Where defendant was tried and convicted in district court, appealed to superior court, and subsequently moved to dismiss the charge pursuant to the former Speedy Trial Act, former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsVIIa35s15A-701" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-701</a></cite> through 15A-704; the court allowed defendant's motion and ordered dismissal of the case without prejudice; on that same day the magistrate issued a new warrant charging the same offense; and the trial judge, later during the same session, reopened the matter, heard additional evidence and arguments and dismissed the case without prejudice to the State, the superior court was not divested of jurisdiction by the magistrate's issuing the second warrant, nor did the State, by securing the second warrant, waive whatever rights to appellate review it might have had. State v. Morehead, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 264 S.E.2d 400, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 201</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 615 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Driving Under the Influence.
   
   - This section grants jurisdiction to the superior court in any action already properly pending in the district court if the grand jury issues a presentment and that presentment is the first accusation of the offense within superior court. Therefore, defendant's driving while impaired (DWI) action was properly under the jurisdiction of the district court and not the superior court when the citation was issued, but as soon as the grand jury issued the presentment, the superior court acquired jurisdiction. State v. Gunter, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 621, 433 S.E.2d 191, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 561</cite>, 439 S.E.2d 154 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A "driving under the influence" misdemeanor charge and a manslaughter felony charge
   
   were based on the same transaction within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-271" target="_self">G.S. 7A-271</a></cite>(a)(3), and therefore the superior court had jurisdiction of both charges and had the right to proceed to the trial on the misdemeanor charge under the joinder exception of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-271" target="_self">G.S. 7A-271</a></cite>, the "original jurisdiction" of the district court having been lost after nolle prosequi was entered as to the misdemeanor in that court. State v. Karbas, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 221 S.E.2d 98, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 618</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 394 (1976).

   - The district court had jurisdiction to try defendant on a warrant charging operation of an automobile without an operator's license in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a02s20-7ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 20-7(a)</a></cite>.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Presentment and Indictment Invalid.
   
   - Superior court properly ruled that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear defendant's case because the presentment and indictment were invalid; because the prosecutor submitted the presentment and the indictment to the grand jury simultaneously, and they were returned by the grand jury simultaneously, each was rendered invalid as a matter of law. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 822 S.E.2d 902 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion to Dismiss Properly Denied.
   
   - Superior court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction because it acquired jurisdiction over the offense after the indictment issued since the charge was initiated by presentment; the State had abandoned its prosecution in district court to the exclusion of its superior court prosecution, which effectively served as the functional equivalent of a dismissal of the district court charge, rendering it no longer valid and pending. State v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 466, 822 S.E.2d 456 (2018).

        A preliminary hearing is not a trial,
   
   but is simply an inquiry into whether the accused should be discharged or whether, on the other hand, there is probable cause to submit the State's evidence to the grand jury and seek a bill of indictment to the end that the accused may be placed upon trial. State v. Cradle, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 499 (1972); State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 227</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 509 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Preliminary Hearing Not Required.
   
   - A preliminary hearing is not a necessary step in the prosecution of a person accused of crime, and an accused person is not entitled to a preliminary hearing as a matter of substantive right. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 227</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 509 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        A preliminary hearing is not an essential prerequisite to the finding of a bill of indictment and it is proper to try the accused upon a bill of indictment without a preliminary hearing. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 227</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 509 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When performing his duties under subsection (b) of this section, the district judge sits only as an examining magistrate
   
   in all felony cases, because the trial of felonies is beyond the jurisdiction of the district court. State v. Bass, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 435</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 384 (1972); State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 227</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 509 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In his capacity as examining magistrate, the district judge is concerned only with determining
   
   (1) whether a felonious offense has been committed, and (2) whether there is probable cause to charge the prisoner therewith. State v. Bass, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 435</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 384 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district judge, in his capacity as committing magistrate, passes only on the narrow question of whether probable cause exists and, if so, the fixing of bail if the offense is bailable. State v. Cradle, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 499 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        District Judge Does Not Render a Verdict.
   
   - The district judge, when sitting as a committing magistrate as authorized by subsection (b) of this section, does not render a verdict; and a discharge of the accused is not an acquittal and does not bar a later indictment. State v. Cradle, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 499 (1972); State v.

       <p>
        Or Have Authority to Dismiss First-Degree Murder Charge.
   
   - A district judge sitting as a committing magistrate in a preliminary hearing has no authority to dismiss a first-degree murder charge. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 227</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 509 (1973).

       State Has Burden to Show Jurisdiction.
   
   - When jurisdiction is challenged, in a criminal case, the State must carry the burden and show beyond a reasonable doubt that North Carolina has jurisdiction to try the accused. Former cases holding that a challenge to the jurisdiction is an affirmative defense with the burden of persuasion on the accused are no longer authoritative. State v. Batdorf, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 486</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 497 (1977).

      <p>
       The question of jurisdiction of the court in a criminal case is not an independent, distinct, substantive matter of exemption, immunity or defense
   
   and ought not to be regarded as an affirmative defense on which the defendant must bear the burden of proof. Rather, jurisdiction is a matter which, when contested, should be proven by the prosecution as a prerequisite to the authority of the court to enter judgment. State v. Batdorf, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 486</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 497 (1977).

        Validity of Trial Without Jury in Lower Court.
   
   - The fact that a right of appeal was given where the defendant was convicted in the lower court without the intervention of a jury has generally been regarded as a sufficient reason, in support of the validity of such trials without a jury in the inferior tribunal, as by appealing the defendant secures his right to a jury trial in the superior court, and therefore cannot justly complain that he has been deprived of his constitutional right. State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 535</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 765 (1970); State v. Coats, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 194 S.E.2d 366 (1973).

         II. APPEAL TO SUPERIOR COURT.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial de novo in the superior court is a new trial from beginning to end,
   
   on both law and facts, disregarding completely the plea, trial, verdict and judgment below; and the superior court judgment entered upon conviction there is wholly independent of any judgment which was entered in the inferior court. State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 535</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 765 (1970); State v. Coats, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 194 S.E.2d 366 (1973); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 254 S.E.2d 649, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 699</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Lower Court Judgment Is Annulled.
   
   - When an appeal of right is taken to the superior court, in contemplation of law it is as if the case had been brought there originally and there had been no previous trial. The judgment appealed from is completely annulled and is not thereafter available for any purpose. State v. Sparrow, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 499</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 897 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 940, 91 S. Ct. 2258, 29 L. Ed. 2d 719 (1971); State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 423, 181 S.E.2d 211 (1971); State v. Coats, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 194 S.E.2d 366 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And May Be Ignored Even Where Defendant Was Denied Constitutional Rights.
   
   - The superior court division, as the trial court upon appeal and trial de novo, is generally justified in disregarding completely the plea, trial, verdict and judgment below, even in those situations in which the inferior court has not granted the defendant his constitutional rights. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 254 S.E.2d 649, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 699</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendants are entitled to a trial de novo
   
   in the superior court even though their trials in the inferior court were free from error. State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 535</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 765 (1970); State v. Coats, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 194 S.E.2d 366 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Even After Guilty Plea.
   
   - An appeal from a conviction in an inferior court entitles the defendant to a trial de novo in the superior court as a matter of right, and this is true even when an accused pleads guilty in the inferior court. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 423, 181 S.E.2d 211 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        An accused in a criminal case is entitled to a trial de novo as a matter of right on appeal to the superior court from an inferior court, even when the accused entered a guilty plea in the inferior court. State v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 239 S.E.2d 471 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But State Not Bound by Plea Bargain After Defendant Appeals.
   
   - Where a defendant originally charged with felonies entered guilty pleas to misdemeanors in the district court pursuant to a plea bargain with the State, but then appealed to the superior court for a trial de novo, the State was not bound by the agreement and could try the defendant upon the felony charges or any lesser included offenses. State v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 239 S.E.2d 471 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Right of Appeal.
   
   - By acquiescing in the terms of the judgment of the district court by paying a fine and costs, defendant waived his statutory right of appeal to the superior court. State v. Vestal, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 239 S.E.2d 275 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Transcript of District Court Proceedings Not Required.
   
   - State's de novo procedure has no requirement that a defendant purchase and provide the superior court with a transcript of the district court proceedings in order to secure full appellate review. State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 392</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 111 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no merit in the argument that a transcript of the district court proceedings is needed for an effective appeal for trial de novo in superior court. State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 392</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 111 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Is Indigent Entitled to Free Transcript.
   
   - There are no constitutional infirmities in the denial of a free transcript of the district court proceedings to an indigent defendant. State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 392</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 111 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Correction of Clerical Error Is Not New Judgment.
   
   - Defendant's purported appeal was untimely because it was not made within 10 days of the original judgment in which the defendant was found guilty of attempted simple assault, simple assault and communicating threats; the district court's intervening correction of various errors on the sentencing form did not constitute a new judgment from which to start counting the ten days. State v. Linemann, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 522 S.E.2d 781 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inquiry as to Failure to Testify Below.
   
   - In a superior court trial for driving under the influence, the State, by inquiring into defendant's failure to testify in district court, did more than attempt to impeach defendant with his prior silence, considering his allegedly belated attempt to establish a defense, but also adversely implicated defendant's right not to testify in district court. State v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 330 S.E.2d 225, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 333</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 492 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence in Superior Court May Be Lighter or Heavier Than That Imposed by District Court.
   
   - Inasmuch as the trial in the superior court is without regard to the proceedings in the district court, the judge of the superior court is necessarily required to enter his own independent judgment. His sentence may be lighter or heavier than that imposed by the inferior court, provided, of course, it does not exceed the maximum punishment which the inferior court could have imposed. State v. Sparrow, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 499</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 897 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 940, 91 S. Ct. 2258, 29 L. Ed. 2d 719 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the sound discretion of the superior court judge, the defendant's sentence may be lighter or heavier than that imposed in the district court provided that it does not exceed the statutory maximum. State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 535</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 765 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And Heavier Sentence Does Not Violate Constitutional or Statutory Rights.
   
   - The fact that a defendant received a greater sentence in the superior court than he received in a recorder's court is no violation of his constitutional or statutory rights. State v. Sparrow, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 499</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 897 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 940, 91 S. Ct. 2258, 29 L. Ed. 2d 719 (1971); State v. Coats, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 194 S.E.2d 366 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that defendants received a greater sentence in the superior court than they received in the district court is no violation of their constitutional rights. State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 535</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 765 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Reasons for Imposing Heavier Sentence Must Affirmatively Appear.
   
   - Whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding. And the factual data upon which the increased sentence is based must be made part of the record, so that the constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be fully reviewed on appeal. State v. Sparrow, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 499</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 897 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 940, 91 S. Ct. 2258, 29 L. Ed. 2d 719 (1971).

       </p>
       <p>
        Remand to District Court.
   
   - Where the appeal has been docketed in the superior court, the judge presiding, at term, has the authority, upon satisfactory cause shown and with the consent of the defendant, to remand the case to the inferior court for clarifying judgment or other proceedings. This would reinstate the case and revest the inferior court with jurisdiction. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 423, 181 S.E.2d 211 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Same - Cause or Consent of Defendant Required.
   
   - Where a defendant has appealed for trial de novo in superior court, a judge of that court has no authority, absent satisfactory cause shown or without the consent of the defendant, to dismiss the appeal and remand the case for compliance with the judgment of the district court. State v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 239 S.E.2d 471 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Appear in Court or Consent to Dismissal.
   
   - Where the defendant neither appears in court when his case is called nor consents to dismissal of his appeal, the trial judge is without authority to dismiss the appeal and remand the case to the district court for compliance with the judgment of that court. The defendant is entitled to a trial as if the case originated in the superior court. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 423, 181 S.E.2d 211 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial Court Erred Where Defendant Entitled to Arraignment in Superior Court.
   
   - By immediately proceeding to trial without defendant's consent on an appeal de novo from a district court, a superior court violated <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIXa51s15A-943ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-943(b)</a></cite>, which defendant adequately invoked; as the superior court was not the court of original jurisdiction, the prosecutor never submitted a bill of indictment for defendant nor was defendant indicted, so there was no 21-day period from which defendant needed to file a written request for an arraignment. A trial de novo in the superior court was a new trial from the beginning to the end, disregarding completely the plea below, and, therefore, since defendant's plea from the district court was completely disregarded, defendant was entitled to an arraignment in superior court. State v. Vereen, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 628 S.E.2d 408 (2006).

     <p>
      A magistrate assigned to an incorporated municipality, the boundaries of which lie in more than one county of a district court district, may, in criminal matters, exercise the powers granted by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7As0Va22s7A-273" target="_self">G.S. 7A-273</a></cite> as if the corporate limits plus the territory embraced within a distance of one mile in all directions therefrom were located wholly within the magistrate's county of residence. Appeals from a magistrate exercising the authority granted by this section shall be taken in the district court in the county in which the offense was committed. A magistrate exercising the special authority granted by this section shall transmit all records, reports, and monies collected to the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the offense was committed. In addition, if a magistrate is assigned to an incorporated municipality, the boundaries of which lie in two or more district court districts, the magistrate may exercise the powers described in this section as if the counties were in the same district court district, if the clerks of superior court and the chief district court judges serving the districts in which the municipality is located agree in writing that the exercise of this special authority would promote the administration of justice in the municipality and in the districts. However, if a magistrate is assigned to an incorporated municipality, the boundaries of which lie in four or more counties, each of which is in a separate district court district, the magistrate may exercise the powers described in this section as if all the counties were in the same district court district, without the necessity of such an agreement between the clerks and judges of the affected counties, and the records, reports, and monies collected in connection with the exercise of that authority shall be transmitted to the clerk of the superior court district for the county in which the offense was committed.

        County was not estopped from challenging the validity of a zoning ordinance in order to avoid the parking condition in a site plan approval because enforcing the doctrine of estoppel would have impaired the county's mandated government function, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa27s7A-302" target="_self">G.S. 7A-302</a></cite>, of providing courtrooms and other amenities.

        Public Duty Doctrine Not Applicable.
   
   - In providing courtrooms, office space, and related judicial facilities, a county is not acting to provide police protection to the general public, and thus, the public duty doctrine is not applicable.

   - County was not subjected to tort liability for claims arising from third-party criminal conduct when a state employee was sexually assaulted in a county courthouse, particularly since the county undertook security measures to protect the public from harm in the courthouse; further the county did not waive its protection under the public duty doctrine.

        Order to Inquire into Adequacy of Facilities Held Flawed.
   
   - A hearing ordered by a superior court judge to inquire into the adequacy of the Alamance County court facilities probes the scope of the court's inherent power to direct county commissioners to ameliorate such facilities and the proper means of effecting that end. Such power exists, but the order invoking it was procedurally and substantively flawed where the commissioners against whom the order was directed were not made parties to the action, the order was ex parte, and the order intruded on discretion that properly belonged to the commissioners.

No costs may be assessed when a case is dismissed.

No court may waive or remit all or part of any court fines or costs without providing notice and opportunity to be heard by all government entities directly affected. The court shall provide notice to the government entities directly affected of (i) the date and time of the hearing and (ii) the right to be heard and make an objection to the remission or waiver of all or part of the order of court costs at least 15 days prior to hearing. Notice shall be made to the government entities affected by first-class mail to the address provided for receipt of court costs paid pursuant to the order.

       "Facilities Fee".

       Trial judges are authorized to tax court costs,

       Court Has Discretion to Waive Costs.
   
   - Trial court erred by failing to exercise its discretion when ordering defendant to pay court costs on a conviction of failure to report his change of address as a sex offender because the imposition of court costs was not mandated by the amended version of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-304ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-304(a)</a></cite>, which applied in this case; the statute included a limited exception under which the trial court was permitted to waive court costs upon a finding of just cause and the trial court's statement to defendant suggested that it was unaware of the possibility of a just cause waiver of costs.

       Costs of Transcript of Prior Trial.
   
   - Trial court did not err by ordering that as a condition of post-release supervision, defendant was required to reimburse the State for its costs of providing him with a transcript of the prior trial and any future transcripts. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 371, 679 S.E.2d 464 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 585</cite>, 683 S.E.2d 211 (2009).

       Restitution Improperly Ordered.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Costs in Cases of Multiple Judgments in Single Case.
   
   - Because defendant's two criminal judgments were part of a single "criminal case" for purposes of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-304" target="_self">G.S. 7A-304</a></cite>, the trial court was only permitted to assess the statutory court costs once across those two judgments. State v. Rieger, - N.C. App.
   - , 833 S.E.2d 699 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       When criminal charges are separately adjudicated, court costs can be assessed in the judgment for each charge, even if the charges all stem from the same underlying event or transaction. This is so because adjudicating those charges independently creates separate costs and burdens on the justice system. When multiple criminal charges arise from the same underlying event or transaction and are adjudicated together in the same hearing or trial, those charges are part of a single "criminal case." State v. Rieger, - N.C. App.
   - , 833 S.E.2d 699 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's assessment of costs in each of the four judgments against defendant violated this section because the State's motion to join all of defendant's charges for trial was granted by the trial court and all of the charges were heard in a single three-day trial. State v. Alexander, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 20, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Imposition of Costs Proper.
   
   - Considering statutory requirements that, absent a waiver, court costs had to be assessed when an active sentence was imposed, the trial court's order that court costs be assessed following the pronouncement that defendant would serve an active sentence satisfied the requirements that defendant be provided notice and an opportunity to be heard on the imposition of those costs. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 416, 742 S.E.2d 338 (2013), review denied <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 287</cite>, 753 S.E.2d 671, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 57 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in assessing defendant lab costs for fingerprint analysis. State v. Velazquez-Perez, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 756 S.E.2d 869 (2014), review dismissed, as moot, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 464 (2014), dismissed and review denied 758 S.E.2d 881, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 469 (N.C. 2014), review denied 2014 N.C. LEXIS 512 (N.C. 2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Fees Erroneous.
   
   - It was error to order defendant to pay more than $10 in jail fees because (1) such fees could only be ordered as a condition of probation, and (2) defendant received an active sentence. State v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 752 S.E.2d 223 (2013).

      <p>
       Authority to Tax Costs Under G.S.
   
   6-20. - Under this section, which specifies in subsection (d) the costs recoverable in civil actions, and also provides in subsection (e) that nothing in this section shall affect the liability of the respective parties for costs as provided by law, the authority of trial courts to tax deposition expenses as costs pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite> remains undisturbed, regardless of the language of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-320" target="_self">G.S. 7A-320</a></cite>. Alsup v. Pitman, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 390 S.E.2d 750 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the trial court's costs ruling was governed by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite>, and thus could be allowed at the discretion of the court, and the doctors had not alleged, and there appeared to the appellate court to be no abuse of discretion in the denial of their request to be reimbursed for the expert witness fees where the verdict was in their favor, the judgment was affirmed. Smith v. Cregan, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 632 S.E.2d 206 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       While deposition costs were not specifically enumerated in the applicable (pre-2007) version of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305</a></cite>, they were common law costs that could be awarded under the previous version of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite> (prior to its amendment by Session Laws 2007-212, s. 2).

      </p>
      <p>
       In a condemnation action, the trial court correctly found that it had no authority to grant a landowner's motion to tax appraisal fees, map costs, and trial exhibit costs against a non-prevailing condemning authority, since under North Carolina Supreme Court precedent, only costs specifically allowed by statute could be taxed against the authority, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)</a></cite>, which delineated generally recoverable costs, did not mention these costs. DOT v. Charlotte Area Manufactured Hous., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 461, 586 S.E.2d 780 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Costs Not Enumerated Were Allowed.
   
   - The trial court rightly exercised its discretion and allowed costs for trial exhibits to be taxed to the appellant patient where the appellee doctor did not receive notice of his voluntary dismissal until the day of trial; the costs were reasonable and necessary pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite> although trial exhibit costs are not enumerated in subsection (d) of this section. Lewis v. Setty, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 536, 537 S.E.2d 505 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Expenses Not Enumerated or Otherwise Provided by Law.
   
   - The expenses incurred in a fraud action for assembling records and court appearances were not assessable costs enumerated under this section or otherwise provided by law. Sara Lee Corp. v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 500 S.E.2d 732 (1998), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 27</cite>, 519 S.E.2d 308 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a condemnation action, the prevailing landowner's map expenses were not taxable as costs against the opposing condemning authority because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)</a></cite> did not mention maps, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite> did not, on its face, make map expenses taxable. DOT v. Charlotte Area Manufactured Hous., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 461, 586 S.E.2d 780 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Costs recoverable following a voluntary dismissal under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 41, are the costs enumerated in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)</a></cite>; therefore, since a defendant requested costs not enumerated in that statute, a motion for costs following plaintiff's voluntary dismissal was properly denied. PharmaResearch Corp. v. Mash, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 419, 594 S.E.2d 148 (2004), cert. denied and dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 733</cite>, 601 S.E.2d 858 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a negligence case, a trial court improperly awarded the cost of trial exhibits because they were not either set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305</a></cite> or recoverable under common law; moreover, the cost of obtaining medical records was not recoverable for the same reason. Morgan v. Steiner, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 577, 619 S.E.2d 516 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Costs and attorney fees were awarded to a property owner in error as <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d3" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(3)</a></cite> did not specifically grant the courts the authority to award attorney fees. Watts v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 641 S.E.2d 811, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 704</cite>, 653 S.E.2d 878 (2007), aff'd in part, modified in part, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 487</cite>, 666 S.E.2d 752 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though about $170,000 was requested, a partial award of $1,726.25 for expert witness costs was not an abuse of discretion under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite> as expert witness fees were discretionary, "common law" costs that were not provided for in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)</a></cite>; the trial judge, who presided over 20 days of trial, was in the best position to assess whether the costs were justified under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) of this section clearly permits suits in forma pauperis on appeal.
   
   To construe the statute otherwise would be constitutionally suspect, thwart the intent of the legislature, and render an injustice to the people of this State, who frequently utilize the services of the district court division for the resolution of disputes. Atlantic Ins. &amp; Realty Co. v. Davidson, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 159</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 668 (1987).

       It is not required that a litigant deprive himself of the daily necessities of life to qualify to appear in forma pauperis.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant Entitled to Appear in Forma Pauperis.
   
   - Trial judge erred in entering order denying petition to appear in forma pauperis of defendant who owned a home valued at $27,150 and other unencumbered personal property, in view of abundant evidence as to defendant's age, health, income, living expenses, inability to work or borrow, indebtedness, and the unreasonableness of selling her house. Atlantic Ins. &amp; Realty Co. v. Davidson, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 159</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 668 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appealing Party Not Prejudiced by Failure of Clerk to Collect Costs.
   
   - Under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, it is clear that the duty of collecting the additional costs at the time of the filing of the papers initiating an appeal is imposed upon the clerk. But a failure of the clerk to perform his duty in this respect should not operate to prejudice the appealing party. Porter v. Cahill, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 162 S.E.2d 128 (1968).

       When, in a builder's suit against a homeowner to enforce a lien, the homeowner was granted summary judgment, the homeowner was not awarded appellate attorneys' fees because no transcripts or evidence allowed the appellate court to decipher how statutorily confidential mediation information was admitted into evidence, or what other evidence the trial court considered.

       Deposition Expenses.
   
   - The expenses for taking depositions, traveling for depositions, videotaping depositions, obtaining copies of depositions from a reporting service, and court reporting services for taking depositions are included within the scope of "deposition expenses."

       Appellate court erred in finding that the defendants were statutorily required to subpoena the expert witnesses in question as a prerequisite for obtaining expert witness fees as costs because the enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d11" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(11)</a></cite> in 2007 allowed for the taxing of reasonable and necessary fees of expert witnesses solely for actual time spent providing testimony at trial, deposition, or other proceedings without requiring the party seeking to obtain the taxing of such costs to demonstrate that the expert witnesses in question testified subject to a subpoena.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the following costs to plaintiffs, including costs for court reporting, videography bills, and trial experts; while defendant pointed out that three experts did not testify against the party against whom plaintiff prevailed, defendant failed to establish that ordering payment of these expert fees was an abuse of discretion.

       Mediation Costs.

       Arbitration Fee.
   
   - Costs were properly allowed to a successful driver even though the driver's insurer paid all of his costs, as: (1) the judgment was entered for the driver and the costs award did not violate <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a01s6-1" target="_blank">G.S. 6-1</a></cite>; (2) the driver incurred the expenses; (3) the award of an arbitration fee was specifically allowed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d7" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(7)</a></cite>; (4) it was not an abuse of discretion under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite> to award the deposition fee; and (5) the preparation time fees of a driver's reconstruct expert were properly allowed.

       Cost of an Independent Appraiser's Valuation Report.
   
   - The trial court acted within its discretion when it taxed the entire cost of an independent appraiser's valuation report to the defendants/majority stockholders of a closely-held corporation and ignored or effectually amended the court's pre-trial case management order, in which the court stated that appraisal costs would be shared by both parties.

       Costs in Personal Injury Action.
   
   - Trial court erred in awarding numerous costs not authorized for medical reports, deposition costs, filing fees, travel costs, trial exhibits, color copies, and photocopies; there was statutory authority, however, for the following awards: mediation fees pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d7" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(7)</a></cite>; expert witness fees pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(1)</a></cite>; and service of process fees pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d6" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(6)</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's decision to award deposition-related expenses was supported by the common law, attorney's affidavit, and numerous invoices and receipts, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)</a></cite> by taxing the accident victim for an expert's deposition fee when the expert was under a subpoena; however, the trial court abused its discretion in awarding costs for traveling to a mediation.

       Costs in Condemnation Action.
   
   - As the property owners' billing documents were competent evidence to support awarding attorney's fees in the amounts listed in the affidavits, and the town's contention that it had no opportunity to object to the admission of the billing documents was unfounded, the award of attorney's fees under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.040A.html#t40Aa01s40A-8ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 40A-8(b)</a></cite>, G.S. 1.209.1, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)</a></cite> were affirmed.

       Fees of Guardian Ad Litem.
   
   - Having properly appointed guardian ad litem, the trial court was within its discretion to assess as an item of costs the fees of the guardian ad litem and to tax those fees to either party or apportion them between the parties.

       Photographs, Photocopies, Telephone Calls, Trial Diagrams and Exhibits, and Medical Reports and Records.
   
   - Although the trial court did not err when it awarded over $32,000 in attorneys' fees to a pedestrian who was awarded $7,000 in damages after he was struck by a truck, it did err when it granted the pedestrian's request for reimbursement of costs he incurred to make photocopies, telephone calls, photographs, trial diagrams and exhibits, and to obtain medical reports and records, because those expenses were not recoverable as costs, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305</a></cite>.

   - Costs associated with trial exhibits were not recoverable under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)</a></cite>, and the refusal to award such costs in a medical malpractice action did not constitute error.

      <p>
       Travel Expenses Denied.
   
   - Trial court lacked the authority to assess the travel expenses of plaintiff and her non-subpoenaed witnesses as reimbursed costs to be paid by defendant, and the trial court erred in awarding these expenses to plaintiff as allowable costs.

       Award of Costs Mandatory.
   
   - As a trial court was required, pursuant to controlling precedents, to award certain costs to prevailing defendants under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)</a></cite> without exercising discretion under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite>, a determination as to the reasonableness and necessity of expenses for experts and deposition assistance under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d10" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(10)</a></cite>, (11), and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-314" target="_self">G.S. 7A-314</a></cite> was mandated.

      <p>
       Abuse of Discretion to Reduce Attorneys' Fees Based on Punitive Damages Award.
   
   - Trial court abused its discretion to the extent that it reduced the amount of attorneys' fees that it would have otherwise awarded to beneficiaries based solely on the fact that the beneficiaries received a large punitive damages award because the fact that they received a large punitive damages award was not relevant to a proper attorneys' fee calculation. Lacey v. Kirk, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 767 S.E.2d 632 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of the different purposes sought to be achieved by punitive damages and attorneys' fee awards, a decision to reduce an attorneys' fee award based on the fact that a party received a large punitive damages award would necessarily serve to thwart the purposes sought to be achieved by allowing the recovery of punitive damages without serving any purpose sought to be achieved by an award of attorneys' fees. Lacey v. Kirk, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 767 S.E.2d 632 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although attorneys' fee jurisprudence gives trial judges substantial discretion in determining what amount of attorneys' fees to award in any particular case, the use of a substantial punitive damages award as the sole reason for reducing an otherwise reasonable attorneys' fee award involves reliance upon a factor that has no reasonable bearing on the making of a proper attorneys' fee award and, for that reason, constitutes an abuse of the trial court's discretion. Lacey v. Kirk, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 767 S.E.2d 632 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Mathematical Miscalculation Required Remand.
   
   - In a former employee's action, arising from disputed benefits under his severance agreement, an award of costs to the employer, as the prevailing party, was within the trial court's discretion, but a mathematical error in the calculations thereof warranted a remand. McKinnon v. CV Indus., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 745 S.E.2d 343 (2013).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Costs Were Held Allowable Under Statute.
   
   - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in its award of costs, as the total award of $ 175,547.59 corresponded to the costs itemized in the patient's motion for the stenographic and videographic costs of taking depositions and the expert fees incurred to provide trial testimony, both categories of costs allowable under the statute.

      <p>
       Fees of Guardian in Defense of Petition for Advancement.
   
   - Where petitioner entered a voluntary dismissal of a special proceeding to obtain an advancement from the estate of her incompetent father, the trial court had no authority to order that legal fees incurred by the incompetent's guardian in defending the petition for advancement be charged as part of the costs of the proceeding to be paid by petitioner. In re North Carolina Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 278 S.E.2d 330, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 544</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 393 (1981).

      <p>
       Guardian's Fees Where Clerk Attempted to Remove Administratrix.
   
   - Where the clerk, upon his own motion, sought to have administratrix of estate removed, minor heirs clearly had a vested interest and the right of appeal from the clerk's determination. Thus, clerk took the appropriate and proper step of appointing a guardian ad litem to protect their interests, and the clerk could compel the payment of the necessary expenses from the estate to which the heirs would potentially benefit, including the costs of the guardian ad litem's attorneys' fees.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Costs in Trust and Estate Proceedings Initiated Prior to August 1, 1983.
   
   - The legislature intended that the word "action," in the directive of Session Laws 1983, c. 713, s. 109 stating that the amendment to subdivision (a)(2) of this section "shall become effective August 1, 1983, and shall apply to all actions initiated on and after that date," include estate proceedings in this limited instance. In re King, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 139, 339 S.E.2d 87 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceedings regarding estate administration were "initiated" prior to August 1, 1983, where estate was opened for probate on October 23, 1980. In re King, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 139, 339 S.E.2d 87 (1986), holding that costs to be assessed against estate were governed by subdivision (a)(2) of this section as it existed prior to amendment by Session Laws 1983, c. 713.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any action or proceeding relating to trusts was "initiated" prior to August 1, 1983, where letters of trusteeship for each of the trusts were issued on July 23, 1981. In re King, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 139, 339 S.E.2d 87 (1986), holding that costs to be assessed against estate and trusts were governed by subdivision (a)(2) of this section as it existed prior to amendment by Session Laws 1983, c. 713.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceeds recovered for the wrongful death of a decedent are not subject to the assessment of costs
   
   in the administration of estates of decedents provided for under subdivision (a)(2) of this section, since the proceeds recovered under the wrongful death statute are not a part of the decedent's estate. In re Below, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 184 S.E.2d 378 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian's Fees Where Clerk Attempted to Remove Administratrix.
   
   - Where clerk, upon his own motion, sought to have administratrix of estate removed, minor heirs clearly had a vested interest and the right of appeal from the clerk's determination. Thus, clerk took the appropriate and proper step of appointing a guardian ad litem to protect their interests, and the clerk could compel the payment of the necessary expenses from the estate to which the heirs would potentially benefit, including the costs of the guardian ad litem's attorneys' fees. In re Estate of Sturman, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 378 S.E.2d 204 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney Fees Taxed as Costs.
   
   - In a law firm's suit to recover legal fees due from a decedent's estate, the trial court properly categorized the fees as costs, which were specifically excepted from the interest provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.024.html#t24a01s24-5ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 24-5(b)</a></cite>. Moreover, taken together, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-307ol1c2" target="_self">G.S. 7A-307(c)(2)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa23s28A-23-4" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-23-4</a></cite> clearly supported the concept underpinning the trial court's ruling, which was that the superior court can tax as costs attorney fees incurred when the attorney is the representative of the estate administering its distribution. Nexsen Pruet, PLLC v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 680, 713 S.E.2d 130 (2011).

      - Session Laws 1997-443, s. 18.22(a), added subsection (c). Initially, Session Laws 1997-443, s. 18.22(d) provided that s. 18.22(a) would apply to Columbus, Durham and Rockingham Counties only, and s. 18.22(e) provided that the act would become effective October 1, 1997, and would expire June 30, 1998. Session Laws 1998-23, s. 11(a) amended Session Laws 1997-443, s. 18.22(e) to provide that s. 18.22 would expire when the 1998 Appropriations Act became law; however, this provision was repealed by Session Laws 1998-212, s. 16.3(d). Section 16.3(a) of Session Laws 1998-212 provided that Session Laws 1997-443, s. 18.22 would expire June 30, 1999, and s. 16.3(d) of that act added Wake to the list of counties to which Session Laws 1997-443, s. 18.22 was applicable. Session Laws 1999-237, s. 17.7(a) deleted the sunset for Session Laws 1997-443, s. 18.22, as amended, and added Brunswick, Bladen, New Hanover, and Pender to the list of counties. Session Laws 2000-67, s. 15.3A, added Cumberland, Edgecombe, Nash, Onslow, and Wilson to the list of counties. The provisions of Session Laws 1997-443, s. 18.22(a) have been codified as subsection (c) of this section at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes.

       <b>
        Assessment of Subdivision (a)(1) Tax Held Not to Violate Permanent Injunction Against Collection Against United States or Its Agencies.
       </b>
       - Where power of sale clauses enforced were not in deeds of trust of United States or even of its agencies but were in deeds of trust of lending institutions, terms of consent permanent injunction against collection of tax provided in subdivision (1)(a) of this section (entered into in United States of America v. State of North Carolina, No. 83-1576-CIV-5) did not apply. Whitley v. Griffin, 737 F. Supp. 345 (E.D.N.C. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where at foreclosure sale the lender was the highest bidder and purchaser; a federal agency was named in the foreclosure deed only through assignment of lender's bid; and trustee was required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.045.html#t45a2As45-21.31ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 45-21.31(a)</a></cite> to pay foreclosure tax (which is simply an obligation of trustee that must be paid from proceeds of foreclosure sale), ultimate burden of paying tax did not fall upon United States or its agencies.
   Thus the tax was collectible. Whitley v. Griffin, 737 F. Supp. 345 (E.D.N.C. 1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Assessing Subdivision (a)(1) Tax Held Not to Violate Supremacy Clause of U.S. Constitution.
       </b>
       - Foreclosure tax of subdivision (a)(1) of this section is a nondiscriminatory tax; all trustees who sell real property under power of sale provisions of a deed of trust must pay the tax from sale proceeds. The only exception arises from the terms of the Consent Permanent Injunction entered into in United States of America v. State of North Carolina No. 83-1576-CIV-5; the tax is not unconstitutionally imposed upon proceeds of foreclosure sale but is indiscriminately imposed upon every trustee who sells under power of sale provisions of a deed of trust. The fact that lender is entitled to reimbursement from HUD for two-thirds of
   foreclosure costs does not alter conclusion that ultimate burden of paying tax is not on federal agency; a portion of the tax is not reimbursed and to allow trustee to avoid the tax on entire purchase price simply because federal agency has a contractual obligation to repay tax would deprive state of collecting one-third of revenues. Whitley v. Griffin, 737 F. Supp. 345 (E.D.N.C. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since foreclosure tax provided for in subdivision (a)(1) of this section is not imposed upon seller (lender), purchaser (borrower) or purchaser's assignee (federal agency) but is levied upon proceeds held by trustee and must be paid by the trustee the fact that the federal government sets forth many requirements and reimburses lender for part of foreclosure costs does not make the foreclosure sale a governmental activity. Therefore, state is not constitutionally prohibited from collecting the tax. Whitley v. Griffin, 737 F. Supp. 345 (E.D.N.C. 1990).

       Fees Erroneous
   
   - It was error to order defendant to pay more than $10 in jail fees because (1) such fees could only be ordered as a condition of probation, and (2) defendant received an active sentence. State v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 752 S.E.2d 223 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in calculating the amount of jail fees assessed against defendant because the daily rate of $10 provided in the revised version of the statute at issue was inapplicable to defendant where it did not become effective until after he had completed his pretrial confinement, the trial court acted contrary to the statutory mandate in calculating the jail fees defendant was prejudiced by having to pay twice the amount of jail fees authorized by the statute, and defendant was not barred by res judicata from seeking review of the jail fees issue where he was granted a new sentencing hearing on another point and the appellate court did not previously address the jail fees issue.

      <p>
       Award of Costs Mandatory.
   
   - As a trial court was required, pursuant to controlling precedents, to award certain costs to prevailing defendants under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)</a></cite> without exercising discretion under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite>, a determination as to the reasonableness and necessity of expenses for experts and deposition assistance under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d10" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(10)</a></cite>, (11), and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-314" target="_self">G.S. 7A-314</a></cite> was mandated. Khomyak v. Meek, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 54, 715 S.E.2d 218 (2011), review denied, 720 S.E.2d 392, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 31 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Experts Must Be Subpoenaed.
   
   - Where one expert was not served with a subpoena and another was unsure as to what a subpoena was, the trial court did not have the authority to order defendants to pay expert witness expenses as costs. Rogers v. Sportsworld of Rocky Mount, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 709, 518 S.E.2d 551 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is error for a trial court to tax an expert witness fee as part of the costs when the expert has not testified pursuant to a subpoena. Craven v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 287 S.E.2d 905 (1982), overruled on other grounds, Johnson v. Ruark Ob. &amp; Gyn. Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 283</cite>, 395 S.E.2d 85 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly allowed expert witness fees under subsection (d) since defendant deposed the experts pursuant to a subpoena. Town of Chapel Hill v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 463 S.E.2d 421 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in awarding expert witness fees under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.113A.html#t113Aa04s113A-66ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 113A-66(c)</a></cite> of the North Carolina Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.113A.html#t113Aa04s113A-50" target="_blank">G.S. 113A-50</a></cite> et seq., where there was no showing that the expert witnesses appeared under subpoena. Whiteside Estates, Inc. v. Highlands Cove, L.L.C., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 553 S.E.2d 431 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred by granting a pedestrian's request for reimbursement of payments he made to expert witnesses without finding that the pedestrian's expert witnesses were subpoenaed. Overton v. Purvis, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 591 S.E.2d 18 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a medical malpractice case, a trial court did not err by refusing to award expert witness fees because none of the witnesses were under subpoena. Miller v. Forsyth Mem'l Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 385, 618 S.E.2d 838 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in awarding costs for expert witnesses because the witnesses were not under subpoena. Stark v. Ford Motor Co., <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 739 S.E.2d 172 (2013).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Experts Did Not Have to Be Subpoenaed.
   
   - Appellate court erred in finding that the defendants were statutorily required to subpoena the expert witnesses in question as a prerequisite for obtaining expert witness fees as costs because the enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d11" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(11)</a></cite> in 2007 allowed for the taxing of reasonable and necessary fees of expert witnesses solely for actual time spent providing testimony at trial, deposition, or other proceedings without requiring the party seeking to obtain the taxing of such costs to demonstrate that the expert witnesses in question testified subject to a subpoena. Lassiter v. N.C. Baptist Hosps., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 367</cite>, 778 S.E.2d 68 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent that Jarrell v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 698 S.E.2d 190 (2010) and its progeny suggest that the subpoena requirement established in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-314" target="_self">G.S. 7A-314</a></cite> applies to expert witness fees taxed as costs pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d11" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(11)</a></cite>, those decisions are overruled. Lassiter v. N.C. Baptist Hosps., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 367</cite>, 778 S.E.2d 68 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Witness Must Be Subpoenaed.
   
   - While the trial court may award or decline to award witness fees as an exercise of discretion, it may not decline to exercise its discretion by making this determination as a matter of law; this rule does not apply where the witness was not subpoenaed. Holtman v. Reese, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 460 S.E.2d 338 (1995).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial Court's Discretion Supersedes Even the Issuance of Subpoenas.
   
   - But trial court's denial of plaintiff's request for expert witness fees, even if subpoenas were issued, was not an abuse of its discretion. Blackmon v. Bumgardner, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 519 S.E.2d 335 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the trial court's costs ruling was governed by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite>, and thus could be allowed at the discretion of the court, and the doctors had not alleged, and there appeared to the appellate court to be no abuse of discretion in the denial of their request to be reimbursed for the expert witness fees where the verdict was in their favor, the judgment was affirmed. Smith v. Cregan, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 632 S.E.2d 206 (2006).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where witnesses did not testify in obedience to a subpoena,
   
   the trial court was without authority to allow them expert fees or to tax the losing party with the costs of their attendance. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 1</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 641 (1972); Couch v. Couch, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 108, 196 S.E.2d 64 (1973); Brandenburg Land Co. v. Champion Int'l Corp., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 418 S.E.2d 526 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Third witness fees denied.
   
   - In a negligence case, the expert witness fees of two witnesses were taxable under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-314" target="_self">G.S. 7A-314</a></cite>, but fees associated with a third witness testifying on the same issue were not recoverable; in addition, the cost of reviewing records and consulting was not recoverable. Morgan v. Steiner, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 577, 619 S.E.2d 516 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of Witness Fees Was Proper.
   
   - As plaintiffs, the prevailing parties did not ask for the mandatory witness fees outlined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-314ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-314(a)</a></cite> and (b), and apparently did not certify the uniform witness fees to the court clerk as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-314ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-314(a)</a></cite>, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by not awarding the plaintiffs uniform witness fees and travel expenses under G.S. 7A-314(a) and (b). Priest v. Safety-Kleen Sys., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 663 S.E.2d 351 (2008).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction of Trial Court to Award.
   
   - Pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-294" target="_blank">G.S. 1-294</a></cite>, a trial court did not have jurisdiction to decide the issue of attorney fees after a county and its board of commissioners had filed their notice of appeal from the judgment in favor of a chairman of a county airport authority who had been improperly removed from his position; an exception did not apply, as the award of attorney fees under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a01s6-1" target="_blank">G.S. 6-1</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-20" target="_blank">G.S. 6-20</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-19.1" target="_blank">G.S. 6-19.1</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-314" target="_self">G.S. 7A-314</a></cite>, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html#t143a33Cs143-318.16" target="_blank">G.S. 143-318.16</a></cite>B was based upon the chairman being the prevailing party.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Segregate Mandatory From Discretionary Costs.
   
   - Trial court's failure to segregate statutorily required costs from discretionary costs was not a failure to exercise the court's discretion. Priest v. Safety-Kleen Sys., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 663 S.E.2d 351 (2008).

       Instructions on Remand.
   
   - Trial court erred in awarding expert witness fees under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-314" target="_self">G.S. 7A-314</a></cite> for time spent by expert in attending court but not actually testifying because instructions on remand were to assess costs under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-305ol1d11" target="_self">G.S. 7A-305(d)(11)</a></cite> for time actually spent testifying.

   - Judicial Standards Commission's recommended public reprimand was appropriate because a judge's conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice; the judge cooperated with the Commission throughout the proceedings, and she expressed remorse and was willing to seek assistance from the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism to improve her professional reputation and repair her relationship with the chief judge.

       The Judicial Standards Commission shall consist of the following residents of North Carolina: one Court of Appeals judge, two superior court judges, and two district court judges, each appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court; four members of the State Bar who have actively practiced in the courts of the State for at least 10 years, elected by the State Bar Council; and four citizens who are not judges, active or retired, nor members of the State Bar, two appointed by the Governor, and two appointed by the General Assembly in accordance with G.S. 120-121, one upon recommendation of the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and one upon recommendation of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Court of Appeals judge shall act as chair of the Commission.

       The Court of Appeals judge shall serve at the pleasure of the Chief Justice. Terms of other Commission members shall be for six years. No member who has served a full six-year term is eligible for reappointment. If a member ceases to have the qualifications required for the member's appointment, that person ceases to be a member. Vacancies of members, other than those appointed by the General Assembly, are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, for the remainder of the term. Vacancies of members appointed by the General Assembly are filled as provided under G.S. 120-122. Members who are not judges are entitled to per diem and all members are entitled to reimbursement for travel and subsistence expenses at the rate applicable to members of State boards and commissions generally, for each day engaged in official business.

The alternate member shall be from the same division of the General Court of Justice as the judge whose place the alternate member takes. If a member of the Commission who is not a judge becomes disabled, the Governor, if he appointed the disabled member, shall appoint, or the State Bar Council, if it elected the disabled member, shall elect, an alternate member to serve during the period of disability. If a member of the Commission who is not a judge and who was appointed by the General Assembly becomes disabled, an alternate member shall be appointed to serve during the period of disability in the same manner as if there were a vacancy to be filled under G.S. 120-122. In a particular case, if a member becomes disqualified, or is successfully challenged for cause, the member's seat for that case shall be filled by an alternate member selected as provided in this subsection.

Such participation shall not prevent the successor from taking office, but the successor may not participate in the proceeding for which the predecessor's term was extended. This subsection shall apply also to any judicial member whose membership on the Commission is automatically terminated by retirement or resignation from judicial office, or expiration of the term of judicial office.

In addition, with the approval of the Chief Justice, for specific cases, the chair or executive director also may call upon the Director of the State Bureau of Investigation to furnish an investigator who shall serve under the supervision of the executive director. While performing duties for the Commission, the executive director, counsel, and investigator have authority throughout the State to serve subpoenas or other process issued by the Commission in the same manner and with the same effect as an officer authorized to serve process of the General Court of Justice.

       Intent of Article.
   
   - By enacting this Article it was the intent of the General Assembly to provide the machinery and prescribe the procedure for the censure and removal of justices and judges for willful misconduct in office or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).

      <p>
       Function of Commission.
   
   - The Judicial Standards Commission's function is to investigate complaints against sitting judges and candidates for judicial office and to recommend to the Supreme Court what, if any, disciplinary action should be taken. In re Renfer, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 632</cite>, 482 S.E.2d 540 (1997).

      <p>
       Combination of Investigative and Judicial Functions Within Commission Comports with Due Process.
   
   - The combination of investigative and judicial functions within the Commission does not violate a respondent's due process rights. An agency which has only the power to recommend penalties is not required to establish an independent investigatory and adjudicatory staff. In re Kivett, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 635</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 442 (1983).

       Powers of Commission.
   
   - The Judicial Standards Commission is empowered by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-377" target="_self">G.S. 7A-377</a></cite> to investigate complaints, compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence, conduct hearings which afford due process of law, and make recommendations to the Supreme Court about what disciplinary action, if any, should be taken. In re Renfer, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 632</cite>, 482 S.E.2d 540 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceedings before the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission to discipline a sitting judge were dismissed because only the North Carolina Supreme Court or the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission had jurisdiction to discipline sitting judges for conduct in office. N.C. State Bar v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 264</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 743 (2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission can neither censure nor remove.
   
   It functions as an arm of the court to conduct hearings for the purpose of aiding the Supreme Court in determining whether a judge is unfit or unsuitable. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The recommendations of the Commission are not binding upon the Supreme Court,
   
   which will consider the evidence on both sides and exercise its independent judgment as to whether it should censure, remove, or decline to do either. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).

       § 7A-376. Grounds for discipline by Commission; public reprimand, censure, suspension, or removal by the Supreme Court.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t7AsVIIa30s7A-376ol1a">
       The Commission, upon a determination that any judge has engaged in conduct that violates the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct as adopted by the Supreme Court but that is not of such a nature as would warrant a recommendation of public reprimand, censure, suspension, or removal, may issue to the judge a private letter of caution.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsVIIa30s7A-376ol1b">
       Upon recommendation of the Commission, the Supreme Court may issue a public reprimand, censure, suspend, or remove any judge for willful misconduct in office, willful and persistent failure to perform the judge's duties, habitual intemperance, conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. A judge who is suspended for any of the foregoing reasons shall receive no compensation during the period of that suspension. A judge who is removed for any of the foregoing reasons shall receive no retirement compensation and is disqualified from holding further judicial office.
      </li>
      <li id="t7AsVIIa30s7A-376ol1c">
       Upon recommendation of the Commission, the Supreme Court may suspend, for a period of time the Supreme Court deems necessary, any judge for temporary physical or mental incapacity interfering with the performance of the judge's duties, and may remove any judge for physical or mental incapacity interfering with the performance of the judge's duties which is, or is likely to become, permanent. A judge who is suspended for temporary incapacity shall continue to receive compensation during the period of the suspension. A judge removed for mental or physical incapacity is entitled to retirement compensation if the judge has accumulated the years of creditable service required for incapacity or disability retirement under any provision of State law, but he shall not sit as an emergency justice or judge.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction.
   
   - Proceedings before the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission to discipline a sitting judge were dismissed because only the North Carolina Supreme Court or the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission had jurisdiction to discipline sitting judges for conduct in office. N.C. State Bar v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 264</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 743 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Terms Not Vague or Overbroad.
   
   - The phrases "willful misconduct in office" and "conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute" are not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. In re Edens, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 299</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 5 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIIIa09s7A-66" target="_self">G.S. 7A-66</a></cite> was not unconstitutionally vague since the state's highest court had rejected a vagueness challenge to this section, which contained similar language. In re Cline, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 11, 749 S.E.2d 91 (2013), review denied <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 293</cite>, 753 S.E.2d 781, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 51 (2014), cert. denied 135 S. Ct. 132, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 6681, 190 L. Ed. 2d 100 (U.S. 2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Too Nebulous or Subjective.
   
   - The phrases, "willful misconduct in office" and "conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute" are no more nebulous or less objective than the reasonable and prudent man test which has been a part of State negligence law for centuries. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Due Process Requirements Are Met Under This Section.
   
   - An adjudication of guilt under this section meets the requirements of due process since the judge's misconduct must be proved by "clear and convincing evidence." In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This Section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-377" target="_self">G.S. 7A-377</a></cite> Are in Pari Materia.
   
   - The provisions of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-377" target="_self">G.S. 7A-377</a></cite> are parts of the same enactment, relate to the same class of persons and are aimed at suppression of the same evil. The statutes are therefore in pari materia and must be construed accordingly. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        When this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-377" target="_self">G.S. 7A-377</a></cite> are read together properly, they provide that upon recommendation of the Judicial Standards Commission the Supreme Court may censure or remove any justice or judge, may approve or reject the recommendation of the Commission, or may remand the matter for further proceedings. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa16s7A-173" target="_self">G.S. 7A-173</a></cite> are not irreconcilably in conflict with G.S.
   
   14-230. State v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 515</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 774 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        And the legislature did not intend to exempt magistrates from indictment and criminal prosecution under G.S.
   
   14-230 when it included magistrates under the sanctions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa16s7A-173" target="_self">G.S. 7A-173</a></cite> and this section. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIIa31s14-230" target="_blank">G.S. 14-230</a></cite> applies to misconduct in office unless another statute provides for the "indictment" of the officer, but neither <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIVa16s7A-173" target="_self">G.S. 7A-173</a></cite> nor this section provide for criminal charges to be brought against a magistrate who is guilty of misconduct in office. State v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 515</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 774 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Proceeding Neither Civil Nor Criminal.
   
   - A proceeding instituted by the Judicial Standards Commission, like a removal proceeding under N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   4, is neither civil nor criminal in nature. A judge removed by impeachment or by the Supreme Court pursuant to the recommendation of the Commission may still be prosecuted in a criminal court. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court Sits as Court of Original Jurisdiction.
   
   - In proceedings authorized by this section, the Supreme Court sits not as an appellate court but rather as a court of original jurisdiction. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceedings pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite>, regarding censure or removal of a judge, the North Carolina Supreme Court acts as a court of original jurisdiction, rather than in its usual capacity as an appellate court. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge (Brown), <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 278</cite>, 570 S.E.2d 102 (2002).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Powers of Supreme Court.
   
   - Because the Supreme Court of North Carolina's adjudication in a proceeding against a judge was unfettered by the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission's recommendations, the court could remove the judge even if the Commission had suggested a lesser sanction, such as censure. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 202</cite>, 657 S.E.2d 346 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Code of Judicial Conduct Is Guide.
   
   - The General Assembly intended the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct to be a guide to the meaning of this section. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Distinction Between Removal for Misconduct and for Mental or Physical Incapacity.
   
   - The sections of the North Carolina Constitution providing for the removal of judges by impeachment or joint resolution make a careful distinction between judges removed for misconduct and those removed for "mental or physical incapacity." In following the constitutional mandate to "prescribe a procedure in addition to impeachment and address," the legislature made the same distinction in this section. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Resignation of Judge.
   
   - The resignation of a district judge following the filing of a complaint against him by the Commission and service upon him of the verified complaint neither divested the Commission of jurisdiction over him nor rendered the question of his removal from office moot. It was immaterial that the judge, by reason of his resignation, was no longer a district court judge at the time the Commission filed its findings of fact and recommendation that he be removed from office. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assuming that a judge's resignation has been or will be accepted by the Governor, but its effective date has not yet arrived, it does not deprive the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction over a proceeding for the removal of a judge for misconduct and conduct prejudicial to administration of justice. When a resignation specifies the time at which it will take effect, the resignation is not complete until that date arrives. Nor is the case rendered moot by the resignation. In re Kivett, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 635</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 442 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Remedies Not Mooted by Resignation.
   
   - If this section limited the sanctions for willful misconduct in office to censure or removal, the resignation of a judge would render the proceedings moot. The statute, however, envisions not one but three remedies against a judge who engages in serious misconduct justifying his removal: loss of present office, disqualification from future judicial office, and loss of retirement benefits. Only the first of these is rendered moot by resignation. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Not every intemperate outburst of a judge,
   
   especially when it is an isolated, single event, occurring in the privacy of the judge's office and brought on by what the judge might reasonably have perceived to be some provocation, amounts to conduct deserving of discipline. In re Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 320</cite>, 377 S.E.2d 743 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Resignation Did Not Deprive Judicial Standards Committee of Jurisdiction over Question of Misconduct.
   
   - Fact that judge who had entered a plea of guilty to charge of felony possession of cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia and marijuana tendered his resignation from his judicial office did not deprive the Judicial Standards Commission or Supreme Court of jurisdiction over question of whether his conduct was in violation of this section, where prior to the tender of his resignation, the Commission had notified him that formal proceedings had been instituted against him, and he had been served personally with that notice and a copy of the verified complaint specifying the charges against him; the issues raised in this disciplinary proceeding did not become moot by reason of the tender of his resignation. In re Sherrill, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 719</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 255 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Grounds for suspension or removal of a magistrate are the same as for a judge of the General Court of Justice.

        Willful Misconduct Defined.
   
   - Willful misconduct in office is improper and wrong conduct of a judge acting in his official capacity done intentionally, knowingly, and generally in bad faith. It is more than a mere error of judgment or an act of negligence. While the term would encompass conduct involving moral turpitude, dishonesty or corruption, these elements need not necessarily be present. In re Edens, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 299</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 5 (1976); In re Stuhl, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 379</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 562 (1977).

       <p>
        Willful misconduct in office is the improper or wrongful use of the power of his office by a judge acting intentionally, or with gross unconcern for his conduct, and generally in bad faith. It involves more than an error of judgment or a mere lack of diligence. Necessarily, the term would encompass conduct involving moral turpitude, dishonesty or corruption, and also any knowing misuse of the office, whatever the motive. However, these elements are not necessary to a finding of bad faith. A specific intent to use the powers of the judicial office to accomplish a purpose which the judge knew or should have known was beyond the legitimate exercise of his authority constitutes bad faith. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).

       <p>
        Willful Misconduct Not Limited to Time in Court.
   
   - Willful misconduct in office is not limited to the hours of the day when a judge is actually presiding over court, and thus a judicial official's duty to conduct himself in a manner befitting his professional office does not end at the courthouse door.

        Conduct Prejudicial to Administration of Justice That Brings Judicial Office into Disrepute Defined.
   
   - Conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute has been defined as conduct which a judge undertakes in good faith but which nevertheless would appear to an objective observer to be not only unjudicial conduct but conduct prejudicial to public esteem for the judicial office. In re Edens, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 299</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 5 (1976); In re Stuhl, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 379</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 562 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Willful misconduct in office of necessity is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. However, a judge may also, through negligence or ignorance not amounting to bad faith, behave in a manner prejudicial to the administration of justice so as to bring the judicial office into disrepute. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conduct Rather Than Motives Is Determinative.
   
   - Whether the conduct of a judge may be characterized as prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute depends not so much upon the judge's motives but more on the conduct itself, the results thereof and the impact such conduct might reasonably have upon knowledgeable observers. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975); In re Edens, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 299</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 5 (1976); In re Stuhl, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 379</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 562 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a judge receives any personal benefit from his conduct is wholly irrelevant
   
   to an inquiry into his conduct. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975); In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a judge received no personal benefit, financial or otherwise, from his conduct does not preclude his conduct from being conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975); In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a judge receives no personal benefit, financial or otherwise, from his improper handling of a case does not preclude his conduct from being prejudicial to the administration of justice. The determinative factors, aside from the conduct itself, are the results of the conduct and the impact it might reasonably have upon knowledgeable observers. In re Kivett, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 635</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 442 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior Recusal Not Prejudicial.
   
   - Where judge had previously recused himself from a case and on rehearing denied oral motion to recuse himself, the conduct associated with the rulings and the manner in which they were conducted were not such that they would be, to an objective observer, prejudicial to the public esteem of the judicial office. In re Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 586</cite>, 444 S.E.2d 174 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inexperience or Lack of Training No Excuse.
   
   - A trial judge cannot rely on his inexperience or lack of training to excuse acts which tend to bring the judicial office into disrepute. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Private Indiscretions.
   
   - A judge may commit indiscretions, or worse, in his private life which bring the judicial office into disrepute. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Disposition of cases for reasons other than an honest appraisal of facts and law,
   
   as disclosed by the evidence presented, will amount to conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975); In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S.

       </p>
       <p>
        The ex parte disposition of a case by a judge for reasons other than an honest appraisal of the law and facts as disclosed by the evidence and the advocacy of both parties to the proceeding amounts to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which in due course will bring the judicial office into disrepute. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
       </p>

        Interference with Former Client's Judicial Proceedings.
   
   - Because a judge stipulated that his conduct, which included encouraging another judge to go easy on a former client, violated N.C. Jud. Conduct 1, 2A, 2B, 3A(4), 3C(1)(a), and 3D and constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brought the judicial office into disrepute, the court censured him pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-377" target="_self">G.S. 7A-377</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Ex parte disposition of a criminal case out of court
   
   will amount to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge was censured for conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice
   
   where he failed to continue a bad check action and improperly issued an arrest order. In re Ammons, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 195</cite>, 473 S.E.2d 326 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge was censured for misconduct under circumstances in which the judge entered an ex parte order striking an earlier order that had been entered by a different district court judge that had found a party in contempt for failure to pay child support, and the judge did not deny that he entered the ex parte order without notice to the plaintiff and without taking evidence; the defendant in that case subsequently vanished, causing problems to the other party, who had obtained an order in her favor, and thus the judge engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice so as to bring his judicial office into disrepute regardless of his good intentions. In re Royster, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 560</cite>, 648 S.E.2d 837 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction of Failure to File Federal Income Tax Returns.
   
   - Judge was removed from office based on his guilty plea to failure to file federal income tax returns because this conviction involved moral turpitude and conduct prejudicial to administration of justice that brought the judicial office into disrepute. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge (Ballance), <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 338</cite>, 643 S.E.2d 584 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Reprimand.
   
   - Judge was publicly reprimanded because he engaged in conduct in violation of the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brought the judicial office into disrepute; the Judicial Standards Commission found that the judge exhibited a failure to remain patient, dignified, and courteous to the parties appearing before him, made inappropriate comments, and misstated the law. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge (Hill), <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 410</cite>, 778 S.E.2d 64 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Deputy Commissioner of the North Carolina Industrial Commission was publicly reprimanded because he violated Code Judicial Conduct, which amounted to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brought the judicial office into disrepute; the Judicial Standards Commission's findings of fact supported its conclusions of law that by driving under the influence and becoming involved in an accident, the Deputy Commissioner put his own life and the lives of others at risk. In re Inquiry Concerning Shipley, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 595</cite>, 811 S.E.2d 556 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the Judicial Standards Commission's findings of fact were supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in the record, the supreme court accepted its findings and conclusions and adopted them as its own; based upon those findings and conclusions and the recommendation of the Commission, a judge was publicly reprimanded for violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, which amounted to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brought the judicial office into disrepute. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge (Henderson), <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 45</cite>, 812 S.E.2d 826 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judicial Standards Commission's recommended public reprimand was appropriate because the judge cooperated with the Commission throughout the proceedings, and she expressed remorse and was willing to seek assistance from the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism to improve her professional reputation and repair her relationship with the chief judge. In re Smith, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 123</cite>, 827 S.E.2d 516 (2019).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Suspension of Judge.
   
   - Judge was suspended because the Judicial Standards Commission properly concluded that his conduct violated the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct and was prejudicial to the administration of justice, thus bringing the judicial office into disrepute; the judge failed to issue a ruling for more than five years on a motion for permanent child support.

        Improper Membership on Corporate Board.
   
   - Although a judge's confrontation with another judge did not warrant a recommendation of discipline, his violation of N.C. Code Jud.

In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).

       </p>
       <p>
        Judge's disposition of traffic cases out of court and without notice to the prosecuting attorney
   
   and in his absence constituted willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute in that he: (1) improperly deprived the district attorney of the opportunity to participate in their disposition; (2) improperly removed the proceedings from the public domain; and (3) violated the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).

       <p>
        The arbitrary dismissal of a case,
   
   after the district attorney had refused to take a nolle prosequi and without permitting the State to offer its evidence, was willful misconduct in office clearly calculated to bring the court into disrepute. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
   <br />

       <p>
        Failure to Give Notice to Defense Counsel.
   
   - Where the only actual notice to defendant's counsel as to the time of a hearing at which judgment was entered against defendant was one hour before the trial judge began to receive evidence, this conduct did not afford the defendant or his counsel the full right to be heard according to law and was, in effect, a willful ex parte consideration of the proceeding without proper legal notice to defendant or his counsel. Such conduct constituted willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Disposition of Criminal Prosecution Without Notice to District Attorney.
   
   - A criminal prosecution is an adversary proceeding in which the district attorney, as an advocate of the State's interest, is entitled to be present and be heard. Any disposition of a criminal case without notice to the district attorney who was prosecuting the docket, when the matter was not on the printed calendar for disposition, improperly excludes the district attorney from participating in the disposition.

        Signing Order for Delivery of Property Without Notice or Opportunity to Be Heard.
   
   - The conduct of a judge in signing an order for delivery of personal property without notice to defendant or his counsel and without giving opposing party or counsel an opportunity to be heard constituted willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).

       <p>
        Use or Retention of Money Received for Purpose of Paying Defendant's Fine.
   
   - If a judge is indiscreet enough to take money for the purpose of paying a defendant's fine and costs, he should forthwith pay it to the clerk of the court. Any use or retention of such funds, whether it be inadvertent, forgetful, or because the judge is short of cash and intends to apply the money eventually to the purpose for which it was received, if not criminal, is willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).

       <p>
        Sexual Advances to Female Defendants.
   
   - Evidence concerning respondent's behavior toward and with two female criminal defendants who had appeared before him was sufficient to support findings by the Judicial Standards Commission that the respondent's conduct constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that tended to bring the judicial office into disrepute where such evidence tended to show that respondent followed one defendant in his automobile, indicated that he wanted defendant to get into his car, discussed the pending criminal cases against her, and indicated his willingness to appoint an attorney for her in exchange for sexual favors; that respondent subsequently met this same defendant in a parking lot to discuss her situation, and during the course of the conversation made improper advances; and that respondent went uninvited to the home of the second defendant and there attempted to force himself upon the defendant. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 299</cite>, 275 S.E.2d 412 (1981).

       <p>
        Sexual Harassment of Court Personnel
   
   - Where evidence supporting a deputy court clerk's charge against a judge for sexual harassment was equivocal and contradictory, the supreme court after de novo review held that the evidence was in equipoise; as clear and convincing proof that the judge assaulted the clerk was lacking, the matter was dismissed. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 389</cite>, 584 S.E.2d 260 (2002).

        Judge was censured for refusing to recuse himself from a case in which the plaintiff was also the plaintiff in a pending suit against the judge
   
   since this created grounds for disqualification as the judge's impartiality could reasonably have been questioned; the findings of the Judicial Standards Commission that the judge's conduct violated N.C. Code Jud. Conduct 2A, 3C(1) were supported by the evidence and were adopted by the court.

        Presiding over Session Where Judge Himself Was to Appear as Defendant.
   
   - Evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion of the Judicial Standards Commission that respondent's conduct constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that tended to bring the judicial office into disrepute and to support its recommendation of censure where it tended to show that respondent was charged with failure to stop at a stop sign; that he was to appear in district court at a session over which he was scheduled to preside; that he knew that it would be improper to preside over that session; that he said nothing when his case was called; that he did not offer to recuse himself; and that the assistant district attorney, upon learning that respondent was the defendant, took a voluntary dismissal in the case.

        Communication with Defendant and Landlord.
   
   - Where judge communicated with the defendant and his landlord to assist him in his determinations on the question of visitation arrangements concerning a minor child who was not represented by counsel, these actions did not rise to the level of those instances of conduct that have previously been determined to be prejudicial to the administration of justice.

        Convicting Defendants of Traffic Violations with Which They Were Not Charged.
   
   - The actions of respondent/judge constituted willful misconduct, were prejudicial to the administration of justice such that they brought the judicial office into disrepute, violated Canons 2A, 3A(1), and 3A(4) of the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct, and warranted censure where the respondent knowingly convicted one defendant of careless and reckless driving when he had not been charged with that offense and where respondent took the disposition of a second case outside of the courtroom and convicted that defendant, charged with DWI, of careless and reckless driving.

        Conduct Held Willful Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to Administration of Justice.
   
   - A district court judge was guilty of willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute where: (1) He consistently and improperly precluded the district attorney from participating in the disposition of cases on which he was entitled to be heard in behalf of the State, and removed the disposition of cases from public view in open court by transacting the court's business in secrecy; (2) he dismissed cases without a trial, in the absence of the defendant, without the knowledge of the district attorney, and on a day when the cases were not calendared for trial; (3) he maintained a special file in three counties, caused the clerk to remove certain cases from the active criminal docket and to be held in the files until he directed otherwise, and in consequence these cases were not tried speedily or calendared and disposed of in open court in the normal course of business in the district courts of the respective counties; (4) from time to time he paid to the clerk money which he had collected from the defendants in cases which he disposed of in their absence; in two cases he received $27.00 from each of two defendants for the purpose of paying their fines and costs when he disposed of the case; he never "took care of the cases," never paid the fines and costs and never returned the money; in a third such case, he returned the $27.00 after keeping it for 11 months. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the Judicial Standards Commission's findings were supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, the supreme court adopted them as its own; a judge's conduct violated the Canon and was prejudicial to the administration of justice, thus bringing the judicial office into disrepute, because it involved a pattern of pervasive complaints attacking the personal integrity and fairness of the chief district judge. In re Smith, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 123</cite>, 827 S.E.2d 516 (2019).

        Conduct Held Prejudicial to Administration of Justice.
   
   - Former judge's conduct amounted to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute within the meaning of this section where he (1) attempted an assignation with a woman convicted of prostitution and on probation, and gave the impression that he could assist her with her legal problems; (2) changed verdicts in motor vehicle violation cases upon ex parte communications from defendants without providing the State an opportunity to be heard; (3) made an inappropriate advance toward a woman detective; (4) made improper and potentially embarrassing and humiliating remarks to the victim in a criminal proceeding before the court and the victim's girl-friend; and (5) made what could be construed as implied threats to attorneys who were representing clients in cases heard by him or pending before his court.

        Censure of Judge.
   
   - District court judge's conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice, thus bringing the judicial office into disrepute, and she was censured because she engaged in willful misconduct by purposely avoiding any legal ruling on the contempt issues before her; the judge directed the bailiff to handcuff a mother and escort her out of the courtroom without an opportunity to be heard and without any indication of contemptuous behavior and she berated and threatened the mother's children.

        Censure and Suspension of Judge.
   
   - Judge was censured and suspended because: the judge (1) had an undisclosed business relationship with an attorney and did not disqualify himself in cases involving the attorney, thereby calling into question his impartiality; (2) attempted to coerce a district attorney into signing a remittal of disqualification; (3) engaged in retaliatory conduct against the district attorney's office after the district attorney refused to sign the remittal; (4) coerced or attempted to coerce a guilty plea from criminal defendants; and (5) was habitually rude and condescending to those who appeared before him and demonstrated an arrogant and contemptuous demeanor while presiding over court. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 202</cite>, 657 S.E.2d 346 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Suspension of Judge.
   
   - Judge was suspended for 75 days due to violations of N.C. Code Jud. Conduct Canons 1, 2(A), 3(A)(1), 3(A)(4), and 5(F) and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite> because (1) the judge's conduct was egregious, as the conduct had persisted for a number of years, and (2) the judge acted purposefully and willfully and knew or should have known the judge's conduct was contrary to law, as the judge had been cautioned for engaging in substantially similar conduct. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge (Hartsfield), <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 418</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 496 (2012).

       <p>
        Judge was removed from office for conduct which included, inter alia, falsely reporting to newspapers, the North Carolina State Bar, and the United States Department of Justice that certain lawyers and judges had conspired and tried to have her assassinated,
   
   had conspired to file false professional complaints against her, and had conspired to violate her civil rights; the judge also publicly discussed with a newspaper a pending custody case over which she had presided, and had allowed her election campaign to conduct an improper raffle.

        Strict Guidelines as to Censure or Removal Not Desirable.
   
   - Strict guidelines for determining whether a judge or justice should be censured or removed should not be adopted, since each case should be decided upon its own facts. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978); In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Censure and removal are not to be regarded as punishment,
   
   but as the legal consequences attached to adjudged judicial misconduct or unfitness. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Any Conduct Prejudicial to Administration of Justice Warrants Censure.
   
   - Any act by a judge or justice which is prejudicial to the administration of justice and brings the judicial office into disrepute warrants censure. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978); In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Such Conduct Is Not as Serious as Willful Misconduct.
   
   - Conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, unless knowingly and persistently repeated, is not per se as serious and reprehensible as willful misconduct in office, which is a constitutional ground for impeachment and disqualification for public office. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Removal Is Warranted Only for Willful Misconduct.
   
   - A careful distinction should henceforth be made between "willful misconduct in office" and "conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice." A judge should be removed from office and disqualified from holding further judicial office only for the more serious offense of willful misconduct in office. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If a judge knowingly and willfully persists in indiscretions and misconduct
   
   which the Supreme Court has declared to be, or which under the circumstances he should know to be, acts which constitute willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute, he should be removed from office. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978); In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S.

       <p>
        Where a judge's misconduct involves personal financial gain, moral turpitude or corruption, he should be removed
   
   from office. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978); In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).

        Censure Proper.
   
   - Evidence supported the Judicial Standards Commission's decision to censure judge who declared counsel, who initiated preliminary investigation of her before the Judicial Standards Commission, persona non grata, thereby constituting conduct in violation of Canons 2A and 3A(3) of the Code of Judicial Conduct and this section. In re Bissell, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 766</cite>, 429 S.E.2d 731 (1993).

        Where judge was publicly intoxicated, which resulted in his arrest and in a negotiated plea of nolo contendere to the criminal offense of trespass after warning, was again publicly intoxicated which resulted in his conviction of the criminal offense of indecent exposure, and the respondent refused, even after admitting psychological dependency, to abstain from the consumption of alcohol, he was censured for conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. In re Leonard, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 596</cite>, 453 S.E.2d 521 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where judge requested that parties, including district attorney and defendant, meet and indicated his desire to have defendant served with arrest warrant immediately and proposed to conduct bond proceedings himself, he was properly censured for ex parte communications and voluntary injection of himself into a case not properly before him.

        Provision for Disqualification from Office Within Power of Legislature.
   
   - An adjudication of "willful misconduct in office" by the Supreme Court in a proceeding instituted by the Judicial Standards Commission, in which the judge or justice involved has been accorded due process of law and his guilt established by "clear and convincing evidence," is equivalent to an adjudication of guilt of "malpractice in any office" as used in N.C. Const., Art. VI,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   8. Therefore, the legislature acted within its power when it made disqualification from judicial office a consequence of removal for willful misconduct under this section.

        When Judge May Be Disqualified from Future Office.
   
   - When a judge is removed for "mental or physical incapacity" upon the recommendation of the Judicial Standards Commission, the remedy allowed by statute is limited to removal from office. On the other hand, when a judge is removed for reasons other than incapacity, this section (like N.C. Const., Art. IV,

   8, which gives the General Assembly the power to "provide by general law for the retirement of Justices and Judges." Under this power the General Assembly may condition retirement benefits upon good conduct in office. Thus, the General Assembly acted well within its constitutional authority when it provided in this section that a judge who is removed from office for cause other than mental or physical incapacity shall receive no retirement compensation.

        Right to Recover Contributions to Retirement Fund.
   
   - Loss of retirement benefits as the result of the removal of a judge from office for cause other than mental or physical incapacity does not mean that the judge forfeits his right to recover the contributions which he paid into the fund. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).

        The Commission can neither censure nor remove a judge.
   
   It functions as an arm of the court to conduct hearings for the purpose of aiding the Supreme Court in determining whether a judge is unfit or unsuitable. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).

       <p>
        The Commission can neither censure nor remove a judge. It is an administrative agency created as an arm of the court to conduct hearings for the purpose of aiding the Supreme Court in determining whether a judge is unfit or unsuitable. To that end, it is authorized to investigate complaints, hear evidence, find facts, and make a recommendation thereon. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).

       </p>
       <p>
        Focus of Inquiry for Commission.
   
   - Whether the conduct of a judge can fairly be characterized as "private" or "public" is not the inquiry that the Judicial Standards Commission needs to make; rather, the proper focus is on, among other things, the nature and type of conduct, the frequency of occurrences, the impact which knowledge of the conduct would likely have on the prevailing attitudes of the community, and whether the judge acted knowingly or with a reckless disregard for the high standards of the judicial office. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 299</cite>, 275 S.E.2d 412 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The recommendations of the Commission are not binding upon the Supreme Court,
   
   which will consider the evidence on both sides and exercise its independent judgment as to whether it should censure, remove or decline to do either. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978); In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978); In re Kivett, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 635</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 442 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Each case arising from the Commission is to be decided upon its own facts.

       Any citizen of the State may file a written complaint with the Commission concerning the qualifications or conduct of any justice or judge of the General Court of Justice, and thereupon the Commission shall make such investigation as it deems necessary. The Commission may also make an investigation on its own motion. The Commission shall not make an investigation, whether initiated upon its own motion or by written complaint of a citizen of this State, when the motion or complaint is based substantially on a legal ruling by a district or superior court judge and the legal ruling has not yet been reviewed and ruled on by either the North Carolina Court of Appeals or the North Carolina Supreme Court. The Commission is limited to reviewing judicial conduct, not matters of law. The Commission may issue process to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence, to administer oaths, and to punish for contempt.

A respondent who is recommended for public reprimand, censure, suspension, or removal is entitled to a copy of the proposed record to be filed with the Supreme Court, and if the respondent has objections to it, to have the record settled by the Commission's chair. The respondent is also entitled to present a brief and to argue the respondent's case, in person and through counsel, to the Supreme Court. A majority of the members of the Supreme Court voting must concur in any order of public reprimand, censure, suspension, or removal.

        CASE NOTES
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Commission's procedures are required to meet constitutional due process standards,
   
   since a judge's interest in continuing in public office is an individual interest of sufficient importance to warrant constitutional protection against deprivation. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the severe impact which adverse findings by the Judicial Standards Commission and censure or removal by the Supreme Court may reasonably be expected to have upon the individual, fundamental fairness entitles the judge to a hearing which meets the basic requirements of due process. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Due Process Not Violated by Commission's Functions.
   
   - The combination of investigative and judicial functions in the Judicial Standards Commission does not violate a respondent's due process rights under either the federal or North Carolina Constitutions, since it is an administrative agency created as an arm of the court, and any alleged partiality of the Commission is cured by the final scrutiny of the Supreme Court. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite> in Pari Materia.
   
   - The provisions of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite> are parts of the same enactment, relate to the same class of persons, and are aimed at suppression of the same evil. The statutes are therefore in pari materia and must be construed accordingly. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A proceeding begun before the Judicial Standards Commission is neither a civil nor a criminal action.
   
   Such a proceeding is merely an inquiry into the conduct of one exercising judicial power to determine whether he is unfit to hold a judgeship. Its aim is not to punish the individual but to maintain the honor and dignity of the judiciary and the proper administration of justice. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The function of the Commission
   
   is to conduct hearings upon complaints filed against judges and justices, to find facts and make recommendations so as to bring before the Supreme Court the questions of whether a judge or justice should be censured or removed in order to maintain proper administration of justice, public confidence in the judicial system and the honor and integrity of judges. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Powers of Commission.
   
   - The Judicial Standards Commission is empowered by this section to investigate complaints, compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence, conduct hearings which afford due process of law, and make recommendations to the Supreme Court about what disciplinary action, if any, should be taken. In re Renfer, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 632</cite>, 482 S.E.2d 540 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Article Does Not Vest Absolute Discretion in Commission.
   
   - There is no merit in the contention that this Article illegally vests unguided and absolute discretion in the Judicial Standards Commission to choose which complaints to investigate and what evidence it will accept. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The quantum of proof required in proceedings before the Commission
   
   of this State is proof by clear and convincing evidence - a burden greater than that of proof of a preponderance of the evidence and less than that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977); In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The quantum of proof required to sustain the findings of the Commission is by clear and convincing evidence. In re Kivett, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 635</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 442 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Each case arising from the Commission is to be decided upon its own facts.
   
   In re Kivett, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 635</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 442 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A written minority recommendation filed with the Judicial Standards Commission
   
   by one or more of its members is not confidential and should be filed with the State Supreme Court together with the Commission's recommendation. In re Bissell, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 766</cite>, 429 S.E.2d 731 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings as to Character and Credibility Not Required.
   
   - The Commission is not required to make findings concerning a respondent's character or credibility. In re Kivett, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 635</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 442 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Ex Post Facto Doctrine Inapplicable.
   
   - The ex post facto doctrine applies only to criminal prosecutions. Judicial disciplinary proceedings are not criminal actions. In re Kivett, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 635</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 442 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of Conduct That Would Be Grounds for Impeachment Prior to January 1, 1973.
   
   - The ex post facto doctrine does not prohibit the Commission from considering evidence of conduct by a judge that would constitute grounds for impeachment prior to January 1, 1973. The remedies provided by the establishment of the Commission on January 1, 1973, did not abolish removal proceedings by impeachment but are cumulative thereto. In re Kivett, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 635</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 442 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appointment of Attorney Employee of State Bar as Special Counsel.
   
   - The Judicial Standards Commission was authorized to appoint an attorney who was a full-time employee of the North Carolina State Bar as special counsel in a proceeding to investigate alleged misconduct by a district court judge. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 299</cite>, 275 S.E.2d 412 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission can neither censure nor remove.
   
   It functions as an arm of the court to conduct hearings for the purpose of aiding the Supreme Court in determining whether a judge is unfit or unsuitable. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The recommendations of the Commission are not binding upon the Supreme Court,
   
   which will consider the evidence on both sides and exercise its independent judgment as to whether it should censure, remove, or decline to do either. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978); In re Kivett, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 635</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 442 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Nature of Proceeding upon Recommendation of Commission.
   
   - A proceeding before the Supreme Court on the recommendation of the Judicial Standards Commission is neither criminal nor civil in nature, but is an inquiry into the conduct of a judicial officer, the purpose of which is not primarily to punish any individual, but to maintain due and proper administration of justice in our State's courts, public confidence in its judicial system and the honor and integrity of its judges. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The scope of Supreme Court review
   
   in a judicial qualifications proceeding should be that of an independent evaluation of the evidence. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Powers of Supreme Court.
   
   - Because the Supreme Court of North Carolina's adjudication in a proceeding against a judge was unfettered by the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission's recommendations, the court could remove the judge even if the Commission had suggested a lesser sanction, such as censure. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 202</cite>, 657 S.E.2d 346 (2008).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Court's Options in Disposing of Commission Recommendation.
   
   - When this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite> are read together properly, they provide that upon recommendation of the Judicial Standards Commission the Supreme Court may censure or remove any justice or judge, may approve or reject the recommendation of the Commission, or may remand the matter for further proceedings. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite> authorize and empower the Supreme Court, unfettered in its adjudication by the recommendation of the Commission, to make the final judgement whether to censure, remove, remand for further proceedings or dismiss the proceeding. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court is authorized and empowered to order the removal of a judge when the Judicial Standards Commission has only recommended that the judge be censured. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 90</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 367 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge was censured for conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, etc.
   
   where he failed to continue a bad check action and improperly issued an arrest order. In re Ammons, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 195</cite>, 473 S.E.2d 326 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Respondent judge was censured under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite> when he found defendant, who was pleading guilty, not guilty of a DWI charge, without hearing sworn testimony or according the State its full right to participate and be heard in the proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a judge sexually harassed a judicial assistant and a paralegal, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-377" target="_self">G.S. 7A-377</a></cite>, and Rule 3 of the Rules for Supreme Court Review of Recommendations of the Judicial Standards Commission, the judge was censured for conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and violation of the judge's oath of office under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite>, N.C. Code Jud. Conduct 1, N.C. Code Jud. Conduct 2(A), and N.C. Code Jud. Conduct 3(A)(3). In re Inquiry Concerning Daisy, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 622</cite>, 614 S.E.2d 529 (2005).
      </p>

       Because a judge stipulated that his conduct violated N.C. Jud. Conduct 1, 2A, 2B, 3A(4), 3C(1)(a), and 3D and constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brought the judicial office into disrepute, the court censured him pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_self">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa30s7A-377" target="_self">G.S. 7A-377</a></cite>.

       Censure Held Not Appropriate.
   
   - Recommendation of a censure of a judge was not appropriate for conduct that included the judge presiding at a hearing wherein the judge testified under oath and conducted and ruled on objections to counsel's and her own voir dire of witnesses.

       Judge was censured for refusing to recuse himself from a case in which the plaintiff was also the plaintiff in a pending suit against the judge
   
   since this created grounds for disqualification as the judge's impartiality could reasonably have been questioned; the findings of the Judicial Standards Commission that the judge's conduct violated N.C. Code Jud. Conduct 2A, 3C(1) were supported by the evidence and were adopted by the court.

       Public Reprimand.
   
   - Deputy Commissioner of the North Carolina Industrial Commission was publicly reprimanded because he violated Code Judicial Conduct, which amounted to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brought the judicial office into disrepute; the Judicial Standards Commission's findings of fact supported its conclusions of law that by driving under the influence and becoming involved in an accident, the Deputy Commissioner put his own life and the lives of others at risk. In re Inquiry Concerning Shipley, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 595</cite>, 811 S.E.2d 556 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Judicial Standards Commission's findings of fact were supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in the record, the supreme court accepted its findings and conclusions and adopted them as its own; based upon those findings and conclusions and the recommendation of the Commission, a judge was publicly reprimanded for violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, which amounted to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brought the judicial office into disrepute. In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge (Henderson), <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 45</cite>, 812 S.E.2d 826 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial Standards Commission's recommended public reprimand was appropriate because a judge's conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice; the judge cooperated with the Commission throughout the proceedings, and she expressed remorse and was willing to seek assistance from the Chief Justice's Commission on Professionalism to improve her professional reputation and repair her relationship with the chief judge.

       Confidentiality of Documents Concerning Individual Justices or Judges
   
   - There is no statute exempting records pertaining to the development and adoption of rules of Judicial Standards Commission from the scope of the Public Records Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.132.html#t132s132-1" target="_blank">G.S. 132-1</a></cite> et seq., however, subsection (a) of this section specifically addresses the confidentiality of the Commission's documents concerning individual justices or judges; the event that triggers a change in the status of records from confidential to public is a decision by the Commission to institute formal proceedings against a justice or judge by the filing of a complaint, thus, a private admonition falls on the confidential side because it always precedes the filing of a complaint and in fact cannot be issued once the Commission files a complaint against a justice or judge.

      </h3>

       <li id="t7AsIXa36s7A-450ol1a">
        An indigent person is a person who is financially unable to secure legal representation and to provide all other necessary expenses of representation in an action or proceeding enumerated in this Subchapter. An interpreter is a necessary expense as defined in Chapter 8B of the General Statutes for a deaf person who is entitled to counsel under this subsection.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsIXa36s7A-450ol1b">
        Whenever a person, under the standards and procedures set out in this Subchapter, is determined to be an indigent person entitled to counsel, it is the responsibility of the State to provide him with counsel and the other necessary expenses of representation. The professional relationship of counsel so provided to the indigent person he represents is the same as if counsel had been privately retained by the indigent person.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsIXa36s7A-450ol1-b1">
        An indigent person indicted for murder may not be tried where the State is seeking the death penalty without an assistant counsel being appointed in a timely manner. If the indigent person is represented by the public defender's office, the requirement of an assistant counsel may be satisfied by the assignment to the case of an additional attorney from the public defender's staff.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsIXa36s7A-450ol1c">
        The question of indigency may be determined or redetermined by the court at any stage of the action or proceeding at which an indigent is entitled to representation.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsIXa36s7A-450ol1d">
        If, at any stage in the action or proceeding, a person previously determined to be indigent becomes financially able to secure legal representation and provide other necessary expenses of representation, he must inform the counsel appointed by the court to represent him of that fact. In such a case, that information is not included in the attorney client privilege, and counsel must promptly inform the court of that information.

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Legislative Intent.
   
   - This Article clearly manifests the legislative intent that every defendant in a criminal case, to the limit of his ability to do so, shall pay the cost of his defense. It is not the public policy of this State to subsidize any portion of a defendant's defense which he himself can pay. State v. Hoffman, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 727</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 842 (1972); State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 105</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 828 (1977).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         The purpose of the statutory provision for appointment of counsel,
   
   at public expense, for indigent defendants is to put indigent defendants on an equality with affluent defendants in trials upon criminal charges. To deny or restrict the right of the indigent to waive counsel, i.e., to represent himself, while permitting the affluent defendant to exercise such right, has no reasonable relation to the objective of equal opportunity to prevail at the trial of the case. Such classification is beyond the power of the legislature. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Responsibility of State.
   
   - It is manifest that the State has the responsibility to provide an indigent defendant with the effective assistance of counsel and the other necessary resources which are incident to presenting a defense in a criminal prosecution. State v. McDowell, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 279</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 286 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1025, 101 S. Ct. 1731, 68 L. Ed. 2d 220, rehearing denied, 451 U.S. 1012, 101 S. Ct. 2350, 68 L. Ed. 2d 865 (1981).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Who Is Indigent.
   
   - An indigent is not one who lacks sufficient funds over and above his homestead and personal property exemptions and his preexisting debts and obligations to pay the total costs of his defense from beginning to end. An indigent is one who does not have available, at the time they are required, adequate funds to pay a necessary cost of his defense. State v. Hoffman, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 727</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 842 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         The court makes the final determination of indigency,
   
   and this may be determined or redetermined by the court at any stage of the proceeding at which the indigent is entitled to representation. State v. Cradle, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 499 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Appointment of Counsel for Indigent Civil Contemnors.
   
   - Principles of due process embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment require that, absent the appointment of counsel, indigent civil contemnors may not be incarcerated for failure to pay child support arrearages. McBride v. McBride, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 124</cite>, 431 S.E.2d 14 (1993).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Effect of Accepting Counsel Obtained by Family.
   
   - Where, during a pretrial proceeding, defendant explicitly accepted an attorney obtained by his family as counsel of his own choosing, from this point on in the pretrial proceeding defendant was not an indigent within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section, as he had, through his family, secured private representation, and therefore he was not entitled to the appointment of assistant counsel. State v. McDowell, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 363</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 200 (1991).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Hiring Counsel Does Not Preclude Access to Funds for Other Purposes.
   
   - That defendant had sufficient resources to hire counsel does not in itself foreclose defendant's access to state funds for other necessary expenses of representation - including expert witnesses - if, in fact, defendant does not have sufficient funds to defray these expenses when the need for them arises. State v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 101</cite>, 418 S.E.2d 471 (1992).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Right to Counsel May Be Forfeited.
   
   - The defendant forfeited his right to counsel and the trial court did not err by requiring him to proceed pro se, without conducting an inquiry pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>, where he was twice appointed counsel as an indigent, each time releasing his appointed counsel and retaining private counsel; where defendant was disruptive in the courtroom on two occasions, refused to cooperate with his counsel and assaulted him, resulting in an additional month's delay in the trial. State v. Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 521, 530 S.E.2d 66 (2000).

         In Action to Terminate Parental Rights, This Section Controls Over G.S.
   
   1-288. - In a termination of parental rights action, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-288" target="_blank">G.S. 1-288</a></cite> did not control the father's right to appointed counsel because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-450" target="_self">G.S. 7A-450</a></cite> dealt specifically with the determination of indigency of a termination of parental rights respondent seeking appointed counsel, and the more specific statute controlled. In re D.Q.W., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 38, 604 S.E.2d 675 (2004).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Right to Counsel Attaches upon Determination of Indigency.
   
   - If a defendant is determined to be indigent, he is entitled to have counsel provided by the State to represent him during any critical stage of the action or proceeding. State v. Moses, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 191 S.E.2d 368 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         The requirement that the State furnish counsel to each defendant charged with a criminal offense beyond the class of petty misdemeanor is conditioned upon a showing of indigency and inability to procure counsel for that reason. State v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 53</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 831 (1973).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a defendant is charged with a felony or a serious misdemeanor, it is the duty of the trial judge to (1) settle the question of indigency, and (2) if defendant is indigent, appoint counsel to represent him unless counsel is knowingly and understandingly waived. State v. Moses, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 191 S.E.2d 368 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Indigent defendant does not have the right to a lawyer of his choice.

   - The trial court did not impermissibly infringe on defendant's statutory right to the assistance of two attorneys in a capital trial, as required by this section, by permitting only one of his attorneys to object during the prosecutor's direct examination of a witness. State v. Call, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 400</cite>, 545 S.E.2d 190 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1046, 122 S. Ct. 628, 151 L.

   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Nor to Choose Who Will Deliver Closing Argument.
   
   - An indigent defendant represented by two lawyers does not have the right to require that the lawyer of his choice deliver the closing argument at his trial. State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 629</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 375 (1982).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Determination of Right to More Than One Lawyer.
   
   - An indigent defendant's right to court-appointed counsel does not include the right to require the court to appoint more than one lawyer unless there is a clear showing that the first appointed counsel is not adequately representing the interests of the accused. In making that determination the legitimate interest that the State has in securing the best utilization of its legal resources must be considered along with the interests of the defendant. State v. Barfield, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 306</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 510 (1979), cert. denied, 448 U.S. 907, 100 S. Ct. 3050, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1137, rehearing denied, 448 U.S. 918, 101 S. Ct. 41, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1181 (1980); State v. McDowell, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 279</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 286 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1025, 101 S. Ct. 1731, 68 L. Ed. 2d 220, rehearing denied, 451 U.S. 1012, 101 S. Ct. 2350, 68 L. Ed. 2d 865 (1981). But see now subsection (b1) of this section.
        </p>
        <p>
         The appointment of additional counsel is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge and required only upon a showing by a defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist the defendant in the preparation of his defense or that without such help it is probable that defendant will not receive a fair trial. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 437 (1981). But see now subsection (b1) of this section.
        </p>
        <p>
         An indigent defendant's right to the appointment of additional counsel in capital cases is statutory, not constitutional. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 349</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 377 (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court erred in failing to appoint assistant counsel to defendant's retained counsel because assistant counsel, which could not be retained, fell within a "necessary expense" of capital defense, which the State needed to provide or defendant needed to waive. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 321, 608 S.E.2d 74 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 412</cite>, 612 S.E.2d 324 (2005), cert. dismissed <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 87</cite>, 706 S.E.2d 471, 2011 N.C.

   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's denial of defendant's motion for the appointment of assistant counsel
   
   to assist sole practitioner did not constitute an abuse of discretion, where defendant presented no evidence to the trial court that would tend to establish, nor did the record disclose, that defendant's case was so factually or legally complex, or so plagued with other difficulties, as to require the appointment of assistant counsel to ensure defendant's right to a fair trial and an adequate defense. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 558</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 811 (1986), decided under this section as it read prior to 1985 amendment adding subsection (b1).

        <p>
         Absences of Appointed Counsel During Trial.
   
   - A capital murder defendant's right to the assistance of two attorneys was not infringed by the absence of one of them at various times during trial, where no absence was longer than four minutes, one of the two attorneys was always present, and this section does not require that both attorneys be present at all times. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 315</cite>, 514 S.E.2d 486 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1006, 120 S. Ct. 503, 145 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Capital murder defendant's statutory right to the assistance of two counsel was not violated when on the final day of defendant's sentencing hearing, while evidence was being presented, one of defendant's two counsel, with defendant's consent, departed on a previously scheduled vacation. State v. Tirado, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 551</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 515 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 909, 125 S. Ct. 1600, 161 L. Ed. 2d 285 (2005).

         Appointment of Counsel Where Defendant Conducts Own Defense.
   
   - Defendant was not prejudiced in any respect by the appointment of counsel for the limited purpose of furnishing advice to him if so requested, even though defendant waived counsel and conducted his own defense. State v. Harper, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 30, 202 S.E.2d 795, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 375</cite>, 205 S.E.2d 100 (1974).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Absences of appointed counsel during trial
   
   on account of illness did not violate defendant's rights under this section, because he had two other attorneys present; the statute does not require that both appointed attorneys be involved in every aspect of a defendant's case. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 411</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 106 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1084, 120 S. Ct. 808, 145 L. Ed. 2d 681 (2000).

         Although a criminal defendant cannot be required to accept the services of court-appointed counsel, a criminal defendant cannot represent himself and, at the same time, accept the services of court-appointed counsel.

         Defendant Not Indigent at Time of Arrest and Interrogation.
   
   - The record affirmatively disclosed that at the time of his interrogation on the morning of his arrest defendant had funds, immediately available and adequate, with which to employ counsel to provide the legal advice he then needed. His ability to pay the costs of subsequent proceedings was not then a question. That was a matter to be determined when that question arose. The admissibility of defendant's statements to the officers was not, therefore, affected by this Article. The statements were competent evidence and defendant's assignments of error relating to their admission would be overruled. State v. Hoffman, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 727</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 842 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         At the time of defendant's arrest, according to his sworn statement, he had $160 in the bank. The Supreme Court took judicial notice of the fact that for a fee of less than $160 defendant could have obtained counsel for the purpose of advising him with reference to the course of conduct which would serve his best interest at that time. State v. Hoffman, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 727</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 842 (1972).

         The trial court erred in failing to determine defendant's indigency

   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         The trial court erred in finding that defendant was not an indigent
   
   and in refusing to appoint counsel to represent her at her preliminary hearing on a felony charge where defendant's affidavit of indigency stated that she had no income, no money and no property except a 1958 automobile which was paid for, and that she had three children, an unemployed husband and owed $3,000, and where nothing in the record refuted or contradicted the import of defendant's affidavit of indigency. State v. Cradle, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 499 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a prosecution for the capital crime of rape, the trial court erred in finding that defendant was not indigent and could employ counsel at the time he confessed and that he, therefore, could not invoke the former provision of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-457" target="_self">G.S. 7A-457</a></cite> that counsel could not be waived in a capital case, where the evidence before the court disclosed that when arrested defendant was earning $149.00 per month, that he had $5.00 in cash, an automobile on which $56.00 per month was due, and two bonds costing $18.75 each which were in his mother's possession, that his stepfather earned $9,000 per year and had a wife and eleven children other than defendant, and that any contribution the stepfather might make would have to be borrowed. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 38</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 761 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         The fact that the defendant was a painter capable of earning $60.00 per week when he was able to obtain work and that he had made little, if any, effort to secure counsel, either privately or by court appointment, was not sufficient to sustain a finding that he was not indigent at the time of trial, and, therefore, not entitled to a court-appointed attorney when it was requested at the trial. State v. Haire, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 198 S.E.2d 31 (1973).

        <p>
         Once defendant accepted the services of properly retained counsel and consented to the withdrawal of appointed counsel,
   
   he was no longer indigent within the meaning of subsection (a).

         Adequate Time for Appointed and Retained Counsel to Prepare.
   
   - Argument that the trial court erred by not acting ex mero motu to continue a hearing on certain pretrial motions in order to provide his court-appointed counsel adequate time to confer with retained counsel in preparation for the hearing was without merit, where retained counsel had been in the case for at least three and one-half months when the motions were heard, and there was no showing that either appointed or retained counsel was not fully prepared to argue defendant's motions. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 349</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 377 (1988).

        <p>
         Failure to Assert Rights Under Subsection (b1) Does Not Constitute Waiver.
   
   - Subsection (b1) of this section requires the trial court to appoint assistant counsel as a matter of course when an indigent is to be prosecuted in a capital case; it neither expressly nor impliedly places any responsibility on the defendant to ask for assistant counsel. State v. Hucks, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 574</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 240 (1988).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (b1) mandates appointment of assistant counsel "in a timely manner",
   
   which ensures under the particular circumstances of a case that both attorneys representing the indigent defendant have time to effectively prepare for trial; in most cases, that mandate would require appointment of assistant counsel as soon as practicable after indictment of the indigent defendant on a capital charge. State v. Hucks, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 574</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 240 (1988).

         Appointment of Experts Is Within Discretion of Trial Judge.
   
   - This section and the better reasoned decisions place the question of whether an expert should be appointed at State expense to assist an indigent defendant within the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Tatum, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 73</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 562 (1976); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 437 (1981); State v.

        </p>
        <p>
         The appointment of experts to assist an indigent in his defense depends really upon the facts and circumstances of each case and lies, finally, within the discretion of the trial judge. State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 270</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 905 (1977); State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 465</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 242 (1979); State v. Sellars, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 278 S.E.2d 907, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 200</cite>, 285 S.E.2d 108 (1981).
        </p>
        <p>
         The appointment of an expert for an indigent defendant is a matter addressed to the trial judge's discretion and such appointment should be made with caution. State v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 634</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 184 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         The State has no constitutional duty to provide an expert witness to assist in the defense of an indigent. This is a question properly left within the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 384</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 448 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         The trial court has discretion to determine whether a defendant has made an adequate showing of particularized need, and in making its determination the trial court should consider all the facts and circumstances known to it at the time the motion for assistance is made. In re Eldridge, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 152</cite>, 513 S.E.2d 296 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 973, 120 S. Ct. 417, 145 L. Ed. 2d 326 (1999).

         The trial court has authority to approve a fee for the service of an expert witness who testifies for an indigent person. In re Eldridge, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 152</cite>, 513 S.E.2d 296 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 973, 120 S. Ct. 417, 145 L. Ed. 2d 326 (1999).

         As Is Appointment of Investigators.
   
   - The decision whether to provide a defendant with an investigator under the provisions of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-454" target="_self">G.S. 7A-454</a></cite> is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. State v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 55</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 410 (1981), overruled on other grounds, State v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 432</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 743 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         The issue of whether a private investigator should be appointed at State expense to assist an indigent defendant rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 489</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 591 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1230, 105 S. Ct. 1232, 84 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1985).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether investigative assistance is constitutionally mandated
   
   must be determined after consideration of the facts of the case; defendant must demonstrate that the State's failure to provide funds with which to hire an investigator substantially prejudiced his ability to obtain a fair trial. State v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 55</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 410 (1981), overruled on other grounds, State v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 432</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 743 (1985).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         The appointment of an investigator as an expert witness should be made with caution
   
   and only upon a clear showing that specific evidence is reasonably available and necessary for a proper defense. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 437 (1981); State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 489</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 591 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1230, 105 S.

        </p>
        <p>
         When Right to
    Investigator
    <br />
    Arises.
   
   - This section has never been construed to extend to the employment of an investigator in the absence of a showing of a reasonable likelihood that such an investigator could discover evidence favorable to the defendant. State v. Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 91</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 572 (1976); State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 270</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 905 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         Denial of a state-paid private investigator to an indigent defendant under subsection (b) of this section did not, ipso facto, constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws, notwithstanding that such investigators might be available to indigent defendants represented by public defenders under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa37s7A-468" target="_self">G.S. 7A-468</a></cite> and to pecunious defendants. State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 270</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 905 (1977).

         Subsection (b) of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-454" target="_self">G.S. 7A-454</a></cite> require that private investigators or expert assistance be provided only upon a showing by defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist the defendant in the preparation of his defense or that without such help it is probable that defendant will not receive a fair trial. Neither the State nor the federal Constitution requires more. State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 270</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 905 (1977); State v. Shook, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C.

         An indigent defendant's constitutional and statutory right to a state appointed investigator arises only upon a showing by defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood that such an investigator would discover evidence which would materially assist defendant in the preparation of his defense. State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 465</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 242 (1979); State v. Easterling, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 594</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 800 (1980); State v.

         Where, in his motion for the hiring of a private investigator, the defendant alleged that the district attorney furnished him with information that there appeared to be a number of suspects in the initial investigation of the case, and at the hearing the defendant introduced a police report that an automobile which was not the vehicle he was driving was seen "speeding away" from the crime scene, this evidence arose only to the level of mere hope or suspicion that favorable evidence was available; thus, trial court did not err in denying defendant funds for a private investigator. State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 666</cite>, 430 S.E.2d 223 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 946, 114 S. Ct. 387, 126 L. Ed. 2d 336 (1993).

         When Right to Expert Arises.
   
   - Defendant's constitutional and statutory right to a state-appointed expert arises only upon a showing that there is a reasonable likelihood that such an expert would discover evidence which would materially assist defendant in the preparation of his defense. There is no requirement that an indigent defendant be provided with investigative assistance merely upon the defendant's request. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 411, 296 S.E.2d 839 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 155</cite>, 311 S.E.2d 294 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         Expert assistance must be provided only upon a showing by defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist the defendant in the preparation of his defense or that without such help it is probable that defendant will not receive a fair trial. State v. Hefler, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 466, 299 S.E.2d 456 (1983), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 135</cite>, 310 S.E.2d 310 (1984); State v.

        </p>
        <p>
         Expert assistance need only be provided by the State when the defendant can show that it is probable that he will not receive a fair trial without the requested assistance. State v. Craig, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 446</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 740, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 908, 104 S. Ct. 263, 78 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1983); 484 U.S. 887, 108 S. Ct. 42, 98 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         Expert assistance need only be provided by the State when the defendant can show that it is probable that he will not receive a fair trial without the requested assistance, or upon a showing by defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist the defendant in the preparation of his defense. Mere hope or suspicion that favorable evidence is available is not sufficient. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 384</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 448 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         A defendant's constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel does not require that the State furnish a defendant with a particular service simply because the service might be of some benefit to his defense. State v. Cauthen, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 311 S.E.2d 649 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (b) of this section requires the appointment of expert assistance only upon a showing by the defendant that: (1) he will be deprived of a fair trial without the expert assistance, or (2) there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist him in the preparation of his defense. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 193</cite>, 344 S.E.2d 775 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no constitutional requirement that private investigators or experts always be made available, and subsection (b) of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-454" target="_self">G.S. 7A-454</a></cite> require such assistance only upon a showing by defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist the defendant in the preparation of his defense or that without such help it is probable that the defendant will not receive a fair trial. State v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 347 S.E.2d 81 (1986), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 699</cite>, 351 S.E.2d 756 (1987).

        <p>
         This section requires the appointment of expert assistance only upon a showing by the defendant that: (1) he will be deprived of a fair trial without the expert assistance, or (2) there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist him in the preparation of his defense. State v. Crandell, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 487</cite>, 369 S.E.2d 579 (1988).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Mere hope or suspicion that favorable evidence is available
   
   is not enough under the State or federal Constitutions to require that expert assistance or private investigators be provided to an indigent defendant. State v. Holden, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 125</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 513 (1987), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1126, 118 S. Ct. 1074, 140 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1998), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 2835, 100 L.

   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Burden is on defendant
   
   to show a reasonable likelihood that he will be deprived of a fundamentally fair trial without expert assistance at state expense. State v. Zuniga, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 233</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 898, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 959, 108 S. Ct. 359, 98 L. Ed. 2d 384 (1987).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Defendant Must Make a Particularized Showing.
   
   - In order to be entitled to the appointment of experts at State expense or to the payment of such experts, defendant is required to make a particularized showing that (1) he will be deprived of a fair trial without the expert assistance, or (2) there is a reasonable likelihood that expert assistance would materially assist him in the preparation of his case. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 117</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 589 (1988); In re Eldridge, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 152</cite>, 513 S.E.2d 296 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 973, 120 S. Ct. 417, 145 L. Ed. 2d 326 (1999).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         To establish a particularized need for expert assistance,
   
   a defendant must show: (1) he will be deprived of a fair trial without the expert assistance, or (2) there is a reasonable likelihood that the expert will materially assist him in the preparation of his case. State v. Page, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 689</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 225 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1056, 118 S. Ct. 710, 139 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1998).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         To make a threshold showing of specific need for the assistance of an expert,
   
   a defendant must demonstrate either that he will be deprived of a fair trial without expert assistance or that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist him in the preparation of his case. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 722</cite>, 477 S.E.2d 147 (1996).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         But Defendant Is Not Required to Affirmatively Discredit State's Witness as Threshold Requirement.
   
   - While the threshold showing of specific necessity for the appointment of a technical expert is not a light burden, it is not so severe as to require that a defendant affirmatively discredit the State's expert witness before gaining access to his own. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 327</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 648 (1988).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Focus Is Upon What Was Before Trial Court.
   
   - The focus in determining whether the trial court erred in denying a defendant's request for expert assistance must be upon what was before the trial court at the time of the motions. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 117</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 589 (1988).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to show a "particularized need" for the assistance of a fingerprint expert,
   
   defendant was not required to present a specific basis for questioning the accuracy of the State's determination that the print found at the scene of the offense matched a print taken from defendant. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 327</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 648 (1988).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychiatrist Appointed to Assess Competency Held Insufficient.
   
   - Psychiatrist who was not appointed for the purpose of assisting defendant in preparation of his defense, but was appointed solely for the purpose of assessing defendant's competency to stand trial, did not satisfy the State's constitutional obligation to furnish defendant with a court-appointed psychiatrist. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 327</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 648 (1988).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Refusal to Appoint Expert Upheld - Ballistics Expert.
   
   - In a prosecution for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, where the victim testified that she was shot at point-blank range, but defendant testified that he accidentally shot her when he picked up his shotgun in the den where he had placed it after a hunting trip and pulled the lever to see if it was loaded, and that he was some distance away from the victim when it discharged, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's request for a medical expert and a ballistics expert. Defense counsel could educate himself on the likely effects of a point-blank gunshot to adequately cross-examine the State's witness. State v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 347 S.E.2d 81 (1986), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 699</cite>, 351 S.E.2d 756 (1987).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Same - Investigator.
   
   - Defendant's mere general desire to search for possible evidence which might be of use in impeaching a key witness who provided evidence to support the elements of premeditation and deliberation in murder prosecution was not such a significant factor in the defendant's defense as to justify the appointment of an investigator. State v. Hickey, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 457</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 646 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         Denial of funds for an investigator to interview witnesses was not error where, although defendant's primary language was Spanish, his counsel had no language handicap. State v. Zuniga, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 233</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 898, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 959, 108 S. Ct. 359, 98 L. Ed. 2d 384 (1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         General allegations that defendant's attorney did not have the time or expertise to conduct the investigation, that because witnesses might be reluctant to speak it would take a trained criminal investigator to conduct the investigation, and that without an expert criminal investigator defendant could not obtain an adequate defense and a fair trial, amounted to little more than undeveloped assertions that the requested assistance would be beneficial; thus defendant failed to make the requisite threshold showing of specific necessity, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appointment of an investigator. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 349</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 377 (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where defendant broadly stated that the case was complicated and involved a large number of witnesses, he failed to point to any evidence that might have been obtained by a private investigator and been beneficial to his defense. Mere hope or suspicion that such evidence is available will not suffice. That alone was not enough to require the appointment of additional assistance. State v. Crandell, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 487</cite>, 369 S.E.2d 579 (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         The prohibition of the surveillance of rape victim by a private investigator did not impose an arbitrary barrier, nor a violation of defendant's right to equal protection of the law. State v. Fletcher, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 481 S.E.2d 418 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 285</cite>, 487 S.E.2d 560 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 957, 118 S. Ct. 383, 139 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1997).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Same - Medical Expert.
   
   - The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to appoint a medical expert to assist in the preparation of his defense in a first-degree murder by poisoning case, where defendant failed to set out any facts evidencing a specific or particularized need for a medical expert. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 193</cite>, 344 S.E.2d 775 (1986).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Same - Optometrist.
   
   - The trial court's denial of the defendant's motion for the state-funded services of an optometrist to demonstrate that he could not read his rights waiver form at the time he signed it because he was not wearing glasses was supported by the evidence. State v. Cummings, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 281</cite>, 543 S.E.2d 849 (2001).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's denial of defendant's motions, alleging a question as to the cause of death, for the appointment of a pathologist or other medical expert was not error where, although the defendant arguably made a threshold showing of a specific necessity for the assistance of such experts, he was provided with a copy of the autopsy report, and also had available and used ample medical expertise (including the favorable testimony of the two specialists) in preparing and presenting his defense. State v. Penley, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 30</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 783 (1986).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Same - Psychiatrist.
   
   - Where defendant was convicted of statutory rape and first-degree sexual offense, and where defendant had argued in his affidavit that the appointment of a psychiatrist would assist the defendant in evaluating, preparing, and presenting his defense, trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for appointment of a psychiatrist since defendant offered little more than undeveloped assertions that the requested assistance would be beneficial. State v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 378 S.E.2d 545, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 229</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 787 (1989).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's ex parte motion that a doctor be appointed as an expert on substance induced mood disorder because in that the defendant did not meet his burden of showing particularized need or a reasonable likelihood that the doctor could have materially assisted him in the preparation of his case. Further, the trial court had already appointed a psychologist for defendant. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 382</cite>, 584 S.E.2d 278 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1194, 124 S.

   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Same - Mental Health Care Provider.
   
   - Where a mother in a proceeding to terminate her parental rights failed to demonstrate how the diagnosis and records of a new mental health care provider would materially assist her in her trial preparation and she was unable to demonstrate how she was deprived of a fair trial without the requested expert assistance, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the mother's request for expenses related to expert witness fees. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 616 S.E.2d 264 (2005).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Same - Crime Scene Expert.
   
   - Defendant failed to show a need for a crime scene expert, where the defendant contended that all the evidence was contained in a grocery store (where murders took place) and that the evidence was circumstantial. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 634</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 415 (1998), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 838, 120 S. Ct. 102, 145 L. Ed. 2d 87, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 5307, 68 U.S.L.W. 3225 (1999).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Indigent defendant was not prejudiced by the denial of his request for funds
   
   to hire a psychiatrist or a psychologist, a forensic pathologist, a firearms and ballistics expert, and a behavioral pharmacologist. State v. Sokolowski, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 428</cite>, 474 S.E.2d 333 (1996).

        <p>
         Trial court's authorization of $250 for employment of an expert witness in the field of textile science,
   
   rather than the $500 which defendant in capital murder case had sought, did not constitute error where, in any event, defendant failed to make the requisite showing of specific need for any more funds. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 268</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 48 (1990), cert. denied, 421 S.E.2d 360 (1992).

         As the statutory plan established in this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-454" target="_self">G.S. 7A-454</a></cite> and the plan of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa37s7A-468" target="_self">G.S. 7A-468</a></cite> for State provision of investigative or expert assistance were substantially equivalent,
   
   and there was no real distinction between indigent defendants represented by a public defender and those with court-appointed counsel with respect to the availability of state-provided investigative assistance, denial of defendant's motion for the appointment of an investigator did not violate his constitutionally guaranteed rights to equal protection of the laws. State v. Tatum, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 73</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 562 (1976).

         Psychiatric Examination Two and One-Half Years After Incident.
   
   - It was within the exercise of his discretion for the court to find that a psychiatric examination two and one-half years after shooting incident would not materially assist the indigent defendant in showing his mental condition at the time of the incident. State v. Shook, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 248 S.E.2d 425 (1978).

   - Where there was no evidence presented in the motion to have a court appointed psychiatrist under this section, or at the hearing on the motion to support even a suspicion, much less a reasonable likelihood, that defendant could establish a meritorious defense of insanity, the court's refusal to require the state to pay for an additional psychiatric evaluation was not error. State v. Easterling, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 594</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 800 (1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no violation of an indigent defendant's constitutional rights to due process and equal protection by the trial court's refusal to appoint an additional psychiatric expert where the State has provided competent psychiatric assistance. State v. Bush, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 338 S.E.2d 590 (1986).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Where defendant failed to show a particularized need for jury selection expert,
   
   the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the appointment of a juristic psychologist. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 507</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 847 (1986).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Refusal to Appoint Expert Held Error - Psychiatrist.
   
   - The trial court's denial of defendant's pretrial motion for the appointment of a psychiatrist to assist in his defense was error where, under all the facts and circumstances known to the court at the time the motion for psychiatric assistance was made, defendant had demonstrated that his sanity when the offense was committed would likely be a significant factor at trial. State v. Gambrell, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 249</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 390 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         Defendant, convicted of first degree sexual offense, had a particularized need for the assistance of a psychiatrist in the preparation of his defense, where the credibility of his confession was pivotal in the State's case against him, since the victim could not identify her assailant and there was little other evidence linking defendant to the crime, and where defendant had an I.Q. of 51 and demonstrated that he was easily led and influenced by those in authority. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 327</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 648 (1988).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Same - Fingerprint Expert.
   
   - Defendant made the requisite threshold showing of specific necessity for a fingerprint expert where he showed that absent a fingerprint expert he would be unable to adequately assess the State's expert's conclusion that defendant's palm print, the one item of hard evidence implicating him in the crimes charged, was found at the scene of the attack, that because the victim could not identify her assailant, this testimony by the State's expert was crucial to the state's ability to identify defendant as the perpetrator of the crimes charged against him, and moreover, that due to his mental retardation, he had extremely limited communication and reasoning abilities, and thus could provide defense counsel with little assistance in making a defense. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 327</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 648 (1988).

         An indigent appellant is entitled to receive a copy of the trial transcript at State expense

        <p>
         Test for Determining Right to Free Transcript.
   
   - A free transcript need not always be provided. Instead, availability is determined by the trial court through the implementation of a two-step process which examines (1) whether a transcript is necessary for preparing an effective defense, and (2) whether there are alternative devices available to the defendant which are substantially equivalent to a transcript. If the trial court finds there is either no need of a transcript for an effective defense or there is an available alternative which is substantially equivalent to a transcript, one need not be provided and denial of such a request would not be prejudicial. State v. Rankin, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 712</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 416 (1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         Indigents are to be provided free transcripts of prior proceedings if the trial court determines it necessary for an effective defense or appeal. This determination by the trial court requires a consideration of two factors: (1) the value of the transcript to the defendant in connection with the matters for which it is sought, and (2) whether alternative devices are available which are substantially equivalent to a transcript. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 615, 297 S.E.2d 610 (1982).

        <p>
         Denial of Free Transcript Where Second Trial Not Yet Scheduled.
   
   - In a case where the second trial has not even been rescheduled, denial of an indigent defendant's motion for a free transcript of the record as being untimely is improper because such a holding could only have been based on speculation. State v. Rankin, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 712</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 416 (1982).

          Burden of Proving Inadequacy of Alternatives to Transcript.
         </b>
         - A defendant who claims the right to a free transcript does not bear the burden of proving inadequate such alternatives as may be suggested by the State or conjured up by a court in hindsight. Britt v. North Carolina, 404 U.S. 226, 92 S. Ct. 431, 30 L. Ed. 2d 400 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         An indigent defendant was not entitled, as a matter of right, to a daily transcript
   
   of his trial. State v. Rich, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 60, 185 S.E.2d 288 (1971), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 304</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 179 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was no deprivation of a substantial constitutional right by denial of an indigent defendant's motion that he be provided a daily transcript of the testimony during the trial where defendant could not show that he would be deprived of an opportunity to receive adequate review. State v. Rich, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 60, 185 S.E.2d 288 (1971), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 304</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 179 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         A daily transcript is not a necessary expense of representation which the State is required to provide an indigent defendant under this section. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 678</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 452 (1980).

          Substantially Equivalent Alternative to Transcript.
         </b>
         - Where the trials of a case took place in a small town, and according to defendant's counsel the court reporter was a good friend of all the local lawyers and was reporting the second trial, and it appeared that the reporter would at any time have read back to counsel his notes of the mistrial well in advance of the second trial if counsel had simply made an informal request, the defendant could have obtained from the court reporter far more assistance than that available to the ordinary defendant, and consequently he had available an informal alternative which appeared to be substantially equivalent to a transcript. Thus, the State court properly determined that the mistrial transcript requested was not needed for a proper defense. Britt v. North Carolina, 404 U.S. 226, 92 S. Ct. 431, 30 L. Ed. 2d 400 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         Failure to comply with the requirement of this section to provide defendant with a complete transcript of his proceedings, as a result of a mechanical malfunction, did not entitle the defendant to any relief because the state's narrative constituted an available alternative that was "substantially equivalent" to the complete transcript, as demonstrated by the testimony of two witnesses that the narrative accurately summarized their testimony at trial. State v. Lawrence, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 1</cite>, 530 S.E.2d 807 (2000).

         Reimbursement of Juvenile's Attorney for Preparation of Transcript.
   
   - As juvenile appellant was entitled to transcript at State expense, her attorney was entitled to be reimbursed for his reasonable expenses in having the transcript prepared. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

      <p>
       At the dispositional, sentencing or other hearing of the person who is less than 18 years old or who is at least 18 years old but remains dependent on and domiciled with a parent or guardian, the court shall make a determination whether the parent, guardian or trustee should be held responsible for reimbursing the State for the person's attorney or guardian ad litem fees.

The test of the party's financial ability to pay is the test applied to appointment of an attorney in cases of indigency. Any provision of any deed, trust or other writing, which, if enforced, would defeat the intent or purpose of this section is contrary to the public policy of this State and is void insofar as it may apply to prohibit reimbursement to the State.

The application for the appointment of such postconviction counsel may be made prior to completion of review on direct appeal and shall be made no later than 10 days from the latest of the following:

The visit shall be permitted during regular business hours for not less than one hour, unless a visit outside regular business hours is agreed to by both the institution's administrator and counsel for the defendant.

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         History of Section.
   
   - See Jolly v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 83</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 135 (1980).
   <br />
        </p>

         <b>
          Right to Counsel in Adversarial Proceedings That Jeopardize Liberty Interests.
         </b>
         - Indigents are entitled to court-appointed counsel under North Carolina law whenever they are involved in adversarial proceedings that jeopardize their liberty interests. An individual facing involuntary commitment for psychiatric treatment or parole revocation proceedings, for example, may petition the State for court-appointed counsel. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         Right Against Self-Incrimination.
   
   - Trial court erred by admitting defendant's affidavit of indigency into evidence because in doing so, it required defendant to surrender his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination in order to assert his right to the assistance of counsel, as his statement of his date of birth on his affidavit was testimonial because he was charged with abduction of a child and statutory rape. However, the error was harmless because neither charge required the State to prove defendant's exact age and the victim's testimony established that defendant was 19 years old and she was 14 when the crimes occurred. State v. Diaz, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 493</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 532 (2019).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         An indigent defendant must accept counsel appointed by the court,
   
   unless he desires to present his own defense. State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 188 S.E.2d 683 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         And Is Not Entitled to Have Court Appoint Counsel of His Own Choosing.
   
   - An indigent is entitled to have the court appoint competent counsel to represent him at his trial, but he is not entitled to have the court appoint counsel of his own choosing or to have the court change his counsel in the middle of the trial. State v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 181</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 652, death sentence vacated, 409 U.S. 1004, 93 S. Ct. 453, 34 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clearly, and for cogent reasons, an indigent defendant is not entitled to have the court appoint counsel of his own choosing. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 211 S.E.2d 539 (1975), overruled on other grounds, State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 539</cite>, 380 S.E.2d 118 (1989).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Dissatisfaction with Court-Appointed Counsel.
   
   - An expression of an unfounded dissatisfaction with his court-appointed counsel does not entitle defendant to the services of another court-appointed attorney. State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 188 S.E.2d 683 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Right of State to Recoup Costs.
         </b>
         - North Carolina is not barred from structuring a program to collect the amount it is owed from a financially-able defendant through reasonable and fairly administered procedures. The State's initiatives in this area naturally must be narrowly drawn to avoid either chilling the indigent's exercise of the right to counsel or creating discriminating terms of repayment based solely on the defendant's poverty. Beyond these threshold requirements, however, the State has wide latitude to shape its attorneys' fees recoupment or restitution program along the lines it deems most appropriate for achieving lawful State objectives. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Lien Against Future Earnings.
         </b>
         - Legal assistance is extended unconditionally once indigency is established, although North Carolina, like many other jurisdictions, reserves to itself a general lien against the petitioner's future earnings should he later become able to pay. The lien is perfected through independent civil proceedings and cannot be enforced unless the indigent had notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, the proceedings. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).

        </h5>
        <p>
         Purpose of Subdivision (a)(1).
   
   - A joint review of legislative history and case law developments in the area of the right to appointed counsel under U.S. Const., Amend. VI leaves no doubt that the purpose of subdivision (a)(1) of this section is to state the scope of an indigent's entitlement to court appointed counsel in criminal cases subject to the limitations of U.S. Const., Amend. VI. Jolly v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 83</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 135 (1980).

         Possibility of Incarceration Shown.
   
   - Where eleven charges were made against indigent defendant, six for issuing worthless checks in amounts below $50.00 and five for checks in amounts above $50.00, defendant was entitled to court-appointed counsel under subsection (a)(1) of this section, since upon his fourth conviction for any of the charges against him, defendant could have been incarcerated for as long as two years as a general misdemeanant.

        </p>
        <p>
         When a court activates a suspended prison sentence, defendant may, upon appeal of such activation, raise the claim that he was unconstitutionally denied counsel at his original trial. State v. Neeley, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 247</cite>, 297 S.E.2d 389 (1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was no prejudice to the defendant when he was not appointed counsel prior to a revocation of sentence hearing in district court where upon his appeal of the district court order he was awarded a trial de novo in superior court, and where counsel was appointed for him in the superior court in ample time to prepare for his defense. State v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 237 S.E.2d 576 (1977).

         - A defendant is not denied meaningful access to the North Carolina Supreme Court simply because the State does not appoint counsel to aid him in seeking discretionary review in that court. At that stage he will have a transcript or other record of trial proceedings, a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and often an opinion by the Court of Appeals disposing of his case. These materials, supplemented by whatever submission respondent may make pro se, would appear to provide the Supreme Court with an adequate basis on which to base its decision to grant or deny review.

   - In a murder prosecution, denial of defendant's motion for appointment of counsel to prosecute a motion for appropriate relief regarding a prior murder conviction in another county was not an abuse of discretion, since the defendant did not show how he was prejudiced thereby or how the use of the guilty plea and prior conviction violated his constitutional rights.

        </p>
        <p>
         The entitlement to counsel begins as soon as possible after the defendant is taken into custody
   
   and continues through any critical stage of the proceeding, including an in-custody interrogation. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 183 S.E.2d 812 (1971).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         In-custody interrogation is a critical stage in proceedings,
   
   at which time the defendant is entitled to counsel. State v. Doss, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 413</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 671 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2875, 33 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1972).

         <b>
          The standard for determining when an "in-custody interrogation" occurs under this section is a question of State law
         </b>
         which is not inextricably linked to the evolving federal standard for an "in-custody interrogation" actionable under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966). Chance v. Garrison, 537 F.2d 1212 (4th Cir. 1976).

        <p>
         Custodial interrogation means questioning initiated by law-enforcement officers
   
   after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. State v. Haddock, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 675</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 208 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         And Where There Was No "In-Custody Interrogation" Counsel Was Not Required.
   
   - Where it was clear that defendant was in custody, but equally clear that no statements were made as a result of questions from police officers and that statements made by defendant were volunteered, the Supreme Court held that there was no "in-custody interrogation"; thus the presence of counsel was not required, and the trial judge correctly admitted into evidence the statements made by defendant. State v. Chance, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 643</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 227 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 940, 92 S. Ct. 2878, 33 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Since Voluntary Statements Are Not Barred.
   
   - The fundamental import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated. There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime, or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by U.S. Const., Amend. V. State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 1</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 561 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         Volunteered statements are competent evidence, and their admission is not barred under any theory of the law, State or federal. And a voluntary in-custody statement does not become the product of an "in-custody interrogation" simply because an officer, in the course of defendant's narration, asks defendant to explain or clarify something he has already said voluntarily. State v. Haddock, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 675</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 208 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Where defendant's narrative confession was not the result of an in-custody interrogation,
   
   even if his indigency was assumed, the presence of counsel was not required at that time. State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 1</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 561 (1971).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         When Article Renders Statements Made on Interrogation Inadmissible.
   
   - If, at the time of his custody interrogation, defendant was indigent and had not signed a written waiver of counsel, this Article would render his statements made on interrogation inadmissible; and this is true whether the evidence offered to prove them was the testimony of a witness who was present or a sound recording of the interrogation itself. State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 1</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 561 (1971).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Admission of Statement Where Defendant Had Previously Testified to Same Facts While Represented by Counsel.
   
   - Admission over objection of an in-custody statement made by defendant without the presence of counsel was harmless error where defendant, while represented by counsel, had testified to the same facts at the trial of his alleged accomplice. State v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 181</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 652, death sentence vacated, 409 U.S. 1004, 93 S. Ct. 453, 34 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1972).

        <p>
         Admission of Confession Made Without Counsel Held Error.
   
   - The trial court erred in the admission of a confession made by defendant in a prosecution for the capital crime of rape at a time when he was indigent and without counsel. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 38</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 761 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Confession Following Waiver of Counsel.
   
   - Undisputed evidence on voir dire examination fully supported findings by the trial court to the effect that the defendant voluntarily went to the police station and waived in writing his right to counsel and his right to remain silent, and made, voluntarily, with full understanding of his rights, and while not under arrest, in the presence of his parents, an oral confession, which was subsequently reduced to writing, and voluntarily signed the written statement of it. Under these circumstances, there was no error in the admission in evidence of either the written confession or the written waiver. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 515</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 282 (1971).

While Rule 2A.2(a) authorized provisional counsel to seek access to a potential capital defendant, it did not require law enforcement to provide that access because defendant had validly waived his rights.

   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         A preliminary hearing is not an essential prerequisite to a bill of indictment;
   
   however, since this section declares a preliminary hearing to be "a critical stage of the action," it follows that an indigent defendant is entitled to the appointment of counsel if such a hearing is held. State v. Gainey, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 366</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 874 (1972).

         The initial appearance before a district court judge is not a critical stage
   
   because it is not an adversarial judicial proceeding where rights and defenses are preserved or lost or a plea taken. Therefore, the reference in subdivision (b)(4) of this section to a preliminary hearing does not mean that a defendant has a right to counsel under U.S. Const., Amend. VI at the initial appearance before the district court judge. State v. Detter, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 604</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 567 (1979).

Hairston, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 220</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 633, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 888, 93 S. Ct. 194, 34 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Failure to Appoint Counsel for Preliminary Hearing Held Harmless Error.
   
   - The failure to appoint counsel to represent an indigent defendant at her preliminary hearing on charges of forgery and uttering a forged check was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt where the testimony at the hearing was not transcribed and was never put before the trial court, the jury which convicted defendant never knew that a preliminary hearing had been conducted, the record did not show that defendant pled guilty or made any disclosures at the preliminary hearing which were used against her at the trial, and the record did not show the loss of any defenses or pleas or motions by failure to assert them at the preliminary hearing. State v. Cradle, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 499 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequent Pleas of Guilty Not Invalidated.
   
   - Failure to accord an indigent defendant his statutory right to counsel at the time he waived preliminary hearing did not invalidate his subsequent pleas of guilty, where the pleas were given at a time when defendant was represented by counsel and the trial court fully inquired into the voluntariness of the pleas. State v. Elledge, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 186 S.E.2d 192 (1972).

         Resentencing Hearing.
   
   - Defendant was entitled to a writ of certiorari and to be resentenced because he was deprived of his right to counsel at a resentencing hearing where the constitutional right to representation by counsel was implicit in the statutes, the threat of imprisonment at the resentencing hearing triggered an absolute right to counsel, and there was no question but that defendant was subject to a threat of imprisonment at his resentencing hearing.

        New Trial Due to Inability to Provide Verbatim Transcript to Defendant.
   
   - Defendant was entitled to a new trial because a verbatim transcript of the evidentiary phase of defendant's trial was unavailable to defendant in preparing for defendant's appeal, as was required by G.S.7A-452(e), and defendant demonstrated the absence of available alternatives to the missing transcripts under N.C. R. App. P. 9(c)(1). State v. Hobbs, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 660 S.E.2d 168 (2008).

        The basis for this section is to provide a fair trial,

        Expert assistance need only be provided by the State when the defendant can show that it is probable that he will not receive a fair trial without the requested assistance, or upon a showing by defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist the defendant in the preparation of his defense. Mere hope or suspicion that favorable evidence is available is not sufficient. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 384</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 448 (1984).

   - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-450ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7A-450(b)</a></cite> and this section require that private investigators or expert assistance be provided only upon a showing by defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist the defendant in the preparation of his defense or that without such help it is probable that defendant will not receive a fair trial. Neither the State nor the federal Constitution requires more. State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 270</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 905 (1977); State v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 55</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 410 (1981), overruled on other grounds in State v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 432</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 743 (1985); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 437 (1981); State v. Corbett, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 169</cite>, 297 S.E.2d 553 (1982); State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 489</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 591 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1230, 105 S. Ct. 1232, 84 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1985); State v. Fletcher, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 481 S.E.2d 418 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 285</cite>, 487 S.E.2d 560 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 957, 118 S. Ct. 383, 139 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's constitutional and statutory right to a state-appointed expert arises only upon a showing that there is a reasonable likelihood that such an expert would discover evidence which would materially assist defendant in the preparation of his defense. There is no requirement that an indigent defendant be provided with investigative assistance merely upon the defendant's request. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 411, 296 S.E.2d 839 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 155</cite>, 311 S.E.2d 294 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The appointment of private investigators should be made with caution and only upon a clear showing that specific evidence is reasonably available and necessary for a proper defense, since there is no criminal case in which defense counsel would not welcome an investigator to comb the countryside for favorable evidence. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 489</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 591 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1230, 105 S. Ct. 1232, 84 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The appointment of an investigator as an expert witness should be made with caution and only upon a clear showing that specific evidence is reasonably available and necessary for a proper defense. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 437 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no constitutional requirement that private investigators or experts always be made available, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-450ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7A-450(b)</a></cite> and this section require such assistance only upon a showing by defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will materially assist the defendant in the preparation of his defense or that without such help it is probable that the defendant will not receive a fair trial. State v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 347 S.E.2d 81 (1986), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 699</cite>, 351 S.E.2d 756 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A private investigator need not be provided when no unique skill is required or when there is no unduly burdensome time requirement
   
   that would prevent defense counsel from adequately conducting the investigation himself. State v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 347 S.E.2d 81 (1986), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 699</cite>, 351 S.E.2d 756 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that an indigent defendant is mildly retarded
   
   is not a sufficient basis to require the appointment of a private psychiatrist, at least where the defendant has already been examined by a psychiatrist at State expense. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 558</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 811 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere hope or suspicion that favorable evidence is available
   
   is not enough under the State or federal Constitutions to require that expert assistance or private investigators be provided to an indigent defendant. State v. Holden, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 125</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 513 (1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 2835, 100 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant Not Required to Affirmatively Discredit State's Witness as Threshold Requirement.
   
   - While the threshold showing of specific necessity for the appointment of a technical expert is not a light burden, it is not so severe as to require that a defendant affirmatively discredit the State's expert witness before gaining access to his own. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 327</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 648 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Fingerprint Expert Must Be Appointed.
   
   - While it is within the trial court's discretion to approve a fee for the appointment of an expert witness to testify for an indigent defendant under this section, it is error of constitutional magnitude to refuse such funds when the defendant has made a threshold showing of specific need and when expert assistance is of material importance to his defense or when its absence would deprive him of a fair trial. These requisites are met when it is apparent that fingerprint evidence is crucial to the State's attempt to prove that defendant was the perpetrator of the charged offense and when denial of a motion for funds precludes an indigent defendant from seeking the assistance of an independent expert in assessing that evidence. State v. Bridges, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 529</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 337 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish a particularized need for expert assistance,
   
   a defendant must show: (1) he will be deprived of a fair trial without the expert assistance, or (2) there is a reasonable likelihood that the expert will materially assist him in the preparation of his case. State v. Page, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 689</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 225 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1056, 118 S. Ct. 710, 139 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to show a "particularized need" for the assistance of a fingerprint expert,
   
   defendant was not required to present a specific basis for questioning the accuracy of the State's determination that the print found at the scene of the offense matched a print taken from defendant. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 327</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 648 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant made the requisite threshold showing of specific necessity for a fingerprint expert
   
   where he showed that absent a fingerprint expert he would be unable to assess adequately the State's expert's conclusion that defendant's palm print, the one item of hard evidence implicating him in the crimes charged, was found at the scene of the attack, that because the victim could not identify her assailant, this testimony by the State's expert was crucial to the State's ability to identify defendant as the perpetrator of the crimes charged against him, and moreover, that due to his mental retardation, he had extremely limited communication and reasoning abilities, and thus could provide defense counsel with little assistance in making a defense. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 327</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 648 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where without his own expert to examine items found at the scene of the crime, defendant could not adequately assess State experts' conclusions that latent prints found at the scene were his, and fingerprint evidence was the only direct evidence linking defendant to the offense, defendant made a threshold showing of specific need and demonstrated that such testimony would be of material assistance in preparing his defense. State v. Bridges, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 529</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 337 (1989).
   <br />

       <p>
        Discretion of Trial Judge.
   
   - This section and the better reasoned decisions place the question of whether an expert should be appointed at State expense to assist an indigent defendant within the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Tatum, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 73</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 562 (1976); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 437 (1981); State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 411, 296 S.E.2d 839 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 155</cite>, 311 S.E.2d 294 (1984); State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 489</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 591 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1230, 105 S. Ct. 1232, 84 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language contained in this section is consistent with the rule that appointment of experts lies within the discretion of the trial judge. State v. Tatum, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 73</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 562 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The decision whether to provide a defendant with an investigator under the provisions of those statutes is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. State v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 55</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 410 (1981), overruled on other grounds in State v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 432</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 743 (1985); State v. Corbett, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 169</cite>, 297 S.E.2d 553 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The grant or denial of motions for appointment of associate counsel or expert witnesses lies within the trial court's discretion and a trial court's ruling should be overruled only upon a showing of abuse of discretion. State v. Sandlin, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 300 S.E.2d 893, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 679</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 760, 464 U.S. 995, 104 S. Ct. 491, 78 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        All defendants in criminal cases shall enjoy the right to effective assistance of counsel and that the State must provide indigent defendants with the basic tools for an adequate trial defense or appeal. However, the State has no constitutional duty to provide an expert witness to assist in the defense of an indigent. This is a question properly left within the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 384</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 448 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion for Funds to Hire Expert Upheld.
   
   - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order fees for an expert witness for a minor who was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric treatment facility because the minor failed to provide the trial court with any evidence from which it could have determined that the motivations of the testifying experts were suspect or that there existed some particularized reason, outside reasons that would be found in a standard case, why the case required funding an expert for the minor In re A.N.B., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 754 S.E.2d 442 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion for Psychiatrist Upheld.
   
   - Where the motion to the court submitted by defendant's counsel simply stated, "That the defendant is an indigent person with court-appointed counsel, and, in the opinion of counsel, psychiatric evidence will be necessary and proper in behalf of the defense of the charges of murder against the defendant," without more, there was no abuse of the trial court's discretion in denying the motion. State v. Grainger, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 694, 225 S.E.2d 595 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where although there was clear and uncontroverted evidence that defendant was mildly retarded, there was no serious contention that defendant's sanity at the time murder was committed would be a significant factor at trial, there was no abuse of discretion in the judge's failure to appoint a private psychiatrist for defendant following his examination by one psychiatrist at State expense. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 558</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 811 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Neuropsychologist Upheld.
   
   - Defendant did not establish a particularized showing that without an evaluation by a neuropsychologist, defendant would be deprived of a fair trial or that there was a reasonable likelihood that a neuropsychologist would materially assist him in the preparation of his case. State v. Rose, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 172</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 211 (1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1135, 115 S. Ct. 2565, 132 L. Ed. 2d 818 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion for Medical Expert Upheld.
   
   - Trial court's denial of defendant's motions, alleging a question as to the cause of death, for the appointment of a pathologist or other medical experts was not error where, although the defendant arguably made a threshold showing of a specific necessity for the assistance of such experts, he was provided with a copy of the autopsy report, and also had available and used ample medical expertise (including the favorable testimony of two specialists) in preparing and presenting his defense. State v. Penley, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 30</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 783 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion for DNA Expert Upheld.
   
   - Notwithstanding any failure to show a particularized need at the time of his motion for the DNA expert, defendant, at oral argument, contended that such need became evident during the course of the trial. However, defendant did not renew his motion for appointment of a DNA expert, nor did he call to the court's attention specific circumstances showing a particularized need; therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion. State v. Mills, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 392</cite>, 420 S.E.2d 114 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to funds to conduct DNA testing or to hire a DNA expert witness since neither defendant nor the State questioned the identity of victim's alleged attacker; thus, defendant failed to demonstrate the necessary particularized need in order to qualify for such funds or appointment of the DNA expert witness. State v. Sines, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 579 S.E.2d 895 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 468</cite>, 587 S.E.2d 69 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion for Expert Witness in Termination Proceeding Upheld.
   
   - Trial court in a termination of parental rights hearing did not err by denying a father's motion for funds to employ an expert witness to examine the child, review his medical records, and assist in preparation for the hearing as there was not a reasonable likelihood that an expert would have materially assisted the parents in the preparation of their defense, or that without such help it was probable that they would not have received a fair trial. In re D.R., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 300, 616 S.E.2d 300 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion for Pathologist Upheld.
   
   - Even though defendant's identity as the perpetrator of the crime charged was critical, and the state's case was built on circumstantial evidence, defendant failed to satisfy his burden of showing either that the assistance of a pathologist would have materially aided him in the preparation of his defense or that the lack thereof deprived him of a fair trial. State v. Moseley, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 1</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 412 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1091, 115 S. Ct. 1815, 131 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion for Medical Expert and Ballistics Expert Upheld.
   
   - In a prosecution for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, where the victim testified that she was shot at point-blank range, but defendant testified that he accidentally shot her when he picked up his shotgun in the den where he had placed it after a hunting trip and pulled the lever to see if it was loaded, and that he was some distance away from the victim when it discharged, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's request for a medical expert and a ballistics expert. Defense counsel could educate himself on the likely effects of a point-blank gunshot to adequately cross-examine the State's witness. State v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 347 S.E.2d 81 (1986), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 699</cite>, 351 S.E.2d 756 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion for Statistician Upheld.
   
   - The trial judge in a murder trial did not err in denying defendant's motion for funds to employ a statistician to review the jury venire in the county over a substantial period of time to determine whether the jury commission failed to perform its statutory duty when compiling the jury venire from which defendant's jury would be selected, where defendant presented no evidence that the new jury selection process in the county was discriminatory, or that the services of a statistician would have resulted in the selection of a more favorable jury. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 558</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 811 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Motion for Investigator Upheld.
   
   - The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to appoint a private investigator to assist defendant, where defense counsel requested the appointment of a private investigator because he did not have time to singlehandedly gather available evidence and interview potential witnesses in preparation for the trial. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 558</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 811 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory plan established in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-450" target="_self">G.S. 7A-450</a></cite> and this section and the plan of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa37s7A-468" target="_self">G.S. 7A-468</a></cite> for State provision of investigative or expert assistance were substantially equivalent. There was no real distinction between indigent defendants represented by a public defender and those with court-appointed counsel with respect to the availability of state-provided investigative assistance. Therefore, the denial of defendant's motion for the appointment of an investigator did not violate his constitutionally guaranteed rights to equal protection of the laws. State v. Tatum, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 73</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 562 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's mere general desire to search for possible evidence which might be of use in impeaching a key witness who provided evidence to support the elements of premeditation and deliberation in murder prosecution was not such a significant factor in the defendant's defense as to justify the appointment of an investigator. State v. Hickey, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 457</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 646 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Funds for Telephone Deposition In Termination Case Was Proper.
   
   - Trial court did not err by denying a father's motion for funds for a telephone deposition in a termination proceeding since the father did not include in his motion his reasons for deposing the foster parents, the information he sought, or that there was a reasonable likelihood that it would have materially assisted in the preparation of the parents' defense. In re D.R., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 300, 616 S.E.2d 300 (2005).

A district court judge shall direct entry of judgment for actions or proceedings finally determined in the district court and a superior court judge shall direct entry of judgment for actions or proceedings originating in, heard on appeal in, or appealed from the superior court. Even if the trial, appeal, hearing, or other proceeding is never held, preparation therefor is nevertheless compensable.

        <b>
         Constitutionality.
        </b>
        - The interlocking statutes and court decisions that regulate North Carolina's ability to recover the costs of court-appointed counsel meet constitutional requirements. The indigent defendant's fundamental right to counsel is preserved under the system; he is given ample opportunity to challenge the decision to require repayment at all critical stages; and he is protected against heightened civil or criminal penalties based solely on his inability to pay. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Like its civil recoupment statute, North Carolina's procedures for imposing the reimbursement of court-appointed counsel fees as a condition of parole are narrowly drawn to avoid unfairness and discriminatory effects. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though far from a paragon of clarity and detail as a complete program, the North Carolina statutes relating to the repayment of attorneys' fees by restitution embody all the required features of a constitutionally acceptable approach. The indigent defendant's fundamental right to counsel is preserved under the North Carolina statute and no preconditions are placed on the exercise of that right beyond a reasonable and minimally intrusive procedure designed to establish the fact of indigency. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        State Will Not Pay What Defendant Can.
   
   - It is not the public policy of this State to subsidize any portion of a defendant's defense which he himself can pay. State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 105</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 828 (1977).

         Right of State to Recoup Expenses.
        </b>
        - North Carolina is not barred from structuring a program to collect the amount it is owed from a financially-able defendant through reasonable and fairly administered procedures. The State's initiatives in this area naturally must be narrowly drawn to avoid either chilling the indigent's exercise of the right to counsel, or creating discriminating terms of repayment based solely on the defendant's poverty. Beyond these threshold requirements, however, the State has wide latitude to shape its attorneys' fees recoupment or restitution program along the lines it deems most appropriate for achieving lawful State objectives. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        North Carolina, like every jurisdiction, has an irrevocable constitutional duty to provide court-appointed counsel to an indigent defendant once he requests it. The developing jurisprudence in this area, however, does not require the State to absorb the expenses of providing such counsel when the defendant has acquired the financial ability to pay. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        No Chilling Effect.
   
   - Informing defendant that he may be required to reimburse the State for the costs of his attorney also does not chill his right to have counsel provided. State v. Cummings, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 291</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 550 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1092, 118 S. Ct. 886, 139 L. Ed. 2d 873 (1998).

        Applicability of Section.
   
   - This section by its terms applies only when an indigent person is determined by the court to be able to pay some but not all of the value of legal services rendered by a public defender. State v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 323 S.E.2d 43 (1984), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 371</cite>, 338 S.E.2d 99 (1986).

         Repayment Not Required Unless Defendant Is Able.
        </b>
        - An indigent receiving court-appointed counsel will never be required to repay the State unless he becomes financially able. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Lien Against Future Earnings Reserved.
        </b>
        - Legal assistance is extended unconditionally once indigency is established, although North Carolina, like many other jurisdictions, reserves to itself a general lien against the petitioner's future earnings should he later become able to pay. The lien is perfected through independent civil proceedings and cannot be enforced unless the indigent had notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, the proceedings. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legal assistance is unconditional once indigency is established, although the State reserves to itself a general lien against defendant's future earnings if defendant is convicted and should later become able to pay. State v. Cummings, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 291</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 550 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1092, 118 S. Ct. 886, 139 L. Ed. 2d 873 (1998).

       <p>
        Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard Required.
   
   - This section provides that the court may enter a civil judgment against a convicted indigent for attorneys' fees and costs. The courts have upheld the validity of such a judgment provided the defendant is given notice of the hearing held in reference thereto and an opportunity to be heard. State v. Washington, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 458, 276 S.E.2d 470 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State assumes the status of a judgment lien creditor against the assets of an indigent defendant who has accepted court-appointed counsel and been found guilty of the offense. The lien is not valid unless the indigent defendant was given both notice of the State claim and the opportunity to resist its perfection in a hearing before the trial court. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition of attorney's fees was erroneous where the trial court did not give defendant an opportunity to be heard regarding the appointed attorney's total hours or the total amount of the fees imposed. State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 616 S.E.2d 306 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was no indication in the record that defendant was notified of and given an opportunity to be heard regarding the appointed attorney's total hours or the total amount of fees imposed, the imposition of attorney's fees had to be vacated. On remand, the State could apply for a judgment in accordance with this statute, provided that defendant was given notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the total amount of hours and fees claimed by the court-appointed attorney. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 805 S.E.2d 729 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred by entering a civil money judgment against because he was not informed of his right to be heard before the court entered the judgment. State v. Friend, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 809 S.E.2d 902 (2018).

State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 814 S.E.2d 843 (2018), rev'd, remanded, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 609</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 254 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in entering a civil judgment against defendant for reimbursement of his court-appointed attorney fees because, while defendant was in the courtroom when the trial court imposed the fees, there was no indication that the trial court addressed defendant with regard to the issue of attorney's fees, or that defendant knew he had the opportunity to address the trial court. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 237, 817 S.E.2d 907 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in entering a civil judgment for attorney's fees against defendant because defendant was not informed of the total amount of attorney's fees that would be imposed, nor given an opportunity to personally address the court where nothing in the record indicated that defendant understood he had a right to be heard on the issue of attorney's fees, the trial court did not inform him that he had a right to be heard on the issue, and the record reflected that the only mention of attorney's fees took place when the trial court stated "attorney's fees will be reduced to a civil judgment." State v. Mayo, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 546, 823 S.E.2d 656 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant was not given an opportunity to be heard before the trial court entered a civil judgment for attorney's fees against defendant upon defendant's conviction, it was proper for the civil judgment to be vacated and the case to be remanded to the trial court for a new hearing on attorney's fees. State v. Pratt, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 875 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a trial court erred in ordering payment of attorney fees without affording an indigent defendant an opportunity to be heard, the vacating of the trial court's imposition of attorney's fees in the matter and the remand of the case was appropriate. State v. Mangum, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 862 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court improperly imposed attorney's fees and an attorney-appointment fee against defendant without providing him with notice and an opportunity to be heard as required by this statute, the two civil judgments entered against defendant were vacated. State v. Ray, - N.C. App.
   - , 842 S.E.2d 647 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in entering a civil judgment against defendant for his appointed trial counsel's fees because there was no indication in the transcript or in the record of proceedings that defendant was apprised of his right to be heard or given the opportunity to be heard on the entry of judgment. State v. Baungartner, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant did not know either the number of hours defendant's appointed counsel planned to submit or the consequent amount defendant would owe in defendant's criminal trial, defendant was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard before the civil judgment for attorneys' fees was entered. Therefore, vacating the civil judgment and remanding the case to the trial court for a waiver by defendant or a hearing on the issue of attorneys' fees was the appropriate remedy. State v. Bowman, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 3, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's civil judgment for attorney's fees was vacated because defense counsel submitted a fee application, but nothing in the record suggested that defendant had notice of the civil judgment for attorney's fees or that he made a knowing waiver of his right to be heard; the proper remedy was remand for further proceedings on that issue. State v. McMillian, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 20, 2021).
       </p>

        Vacation of Judgment for Cost of Public Defender Services.
   
   - Judgment, after criminal conviction, for cost of public defender services will be vacated where court finds that the judgment is not supported in the record by sufficient findings of fact or conclusions of law. State v. Crews, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 427</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 840 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's first-degree murder conviction was reversed and remanded for a new trial due to a presumed ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant was not convicted in the initial trial; therefore, pursuant to that <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455(c)</a></cite>, defendant was not liable for the attorneys' fees in the first trial.

        Costs of Transcript of Prior Trial.
   
   - Trial court did not err by ordering that as a condition of post-release supervision, defendant was required to reimburse the State for its costs of providing him with a transcript of the prior trial and any future transcripts. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 371, 679 S.E.2d 464 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 585</cite>, 683 S.E.2d 211 (2009).

        Payment of Costs for Appointed Counsel as Condition of Probation.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Calculation of Costs for Appointed Counsel.
   
   - Costs of defendant's appointed counsel for both the Class G felony and the Class D felony were the same, and were calculated at the same rate of $70 per hour rate for Class D felonies because the appropriate attorney's fee rate was properly based upon the most serious charge, the Class D felony; and the Office of Indigent Defense Services rules and regulations did not allow for separating the hours spent by appointed counsel for individual charges, all work done for each individual charge was considered work done for every charge, as part of the same case; thus, the appropriate cost of appointed counsel for the Class G charge was 51.73 hours at the $70 Class D felony rate.

        Constitutionality.
   
   - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite> is unconstitutional because the portion of the appointment fee under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite>(a) that is paid to the North Carolina Indigent Persons' Attorney Fee Fund does not fall within the definition of "fees" since it is not directly related to the individual defendant who is resisting prosecution or defending against a particular criminal charge, but helps support that part of the criminal justice system that enables the State constitutionally to prosecute indigent defendants who qualify for court-appointed counsel; N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 does not insulate acquitted defendants from bearing the burden of paying for their own counsel, but it does shield an acquitted defendant from having to pay for a system designed to reimburse the State for expenses necessarily incurred in the conduct of the prosecution. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 92</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 505 (2004).

   <span class="s1">
    §

   23 convincingly demonstrates North Carolina's continuing dedication to the principle that acquitted defendants should not be required to pay the costs of their prosecution; thus, requiring acquitted defendants to pay the appointment fee under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite>, which was a cost of prosecution, would defeat the intent and purpose of either Constitution's provision.

       </p>

        Costs are imposed only at sentencing, so any convicted indigent defendant is given notice of the appointment fee under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite> at the sentencing hearing and is also given an opportunity to be heard and object to the imposition of this cost; therefore, the constitutional requirement of notice and an opportunity to be heard are satisfied, and the imposition of the appointment fee on convicted indigent defendants passes federal constitutional muster.

        Plain Language of N.C. Constitution Prohibits Imposition of Appointment Fee Upon Defendant Unless He Has Been Convicted or Pled Guilty or Nolo Contendere.
   
   - Plain language of N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23, prohibiting the assessment of costs against acquitted defendants, encompasses the appointment fee provided for by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite>(a); by requiring payment of the appointment fee by acquitted defendants, the General Assembly devised a statutory framework that does not comport with the constitutional limitation prohibiting a criminal defendant from paying costs unless found guilty, and as such it may not stand. Accordingly, the appointment fee set out in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite> is a cost of prosecution and may not be imposed upon a defendant in a criminal matter until that defendant has been convicted or pled guilty or nolo contendere.

   <span class="s1">
    §

   23; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1(a)</a></cite>, requiring payment at the time of the appointment was also severed, as it was inconsistent with the ruling that the appointment fee was a cost, and as pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-304ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-304(a)</a></cite>, costs, including the pretrial release services fee under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-304ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7A-304(a)(5)</a></cite> and and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation laboratory fee under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-304ol1a7" target="_self">G.S. 7A-304(a)(7)</a></cite>, were assessed only after a defendant was convicted or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 92</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 505 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        General Assembly effectively acknowledged that the appointment fee would be prepaid infrequently when it provided that counsel could not be denied for failure to pay the appointment fee in advance under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1(d)</a></cite>; requiring the State to collect the appointment fee only after a final determination of guilt does not obstruct the objective of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite>, and the portion of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite>(a) requiring payment "at the time of appointment" shall be severed.

        Severance of the provisions in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1(b)</a></cite> that grant a credit against any attorney's fees owed for any defendant who pays the appointment fee in advance is mandated; because the provision requiring payment at the time of appointment has been severed, no costs are imposed, or can be imposed, until after there is a conviction, and the provisions entitling a defendant to a pre-payment credit shall also be severed. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 92</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 505 (2004).

       <p>
        Purposes of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite> do not depend on requiring payment at the time of appointment and providing a pre-payment credit to those defendants who pay in advance, and allowing the State to collect the appointment fee from convicted indigent defendants upon final disposition permits the State to recoup a portion of its expenses associated with providing a system that enables indigent defendants to be prosecuted; therefore, because the remaining provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite> can be enforced independently of the unconstitutional portions of the section, the unconstitutional provisions of G.S. 7A-455.1 shall be severed and the balance of the section enforced. The State is still permitted to collect the appointment fee from convicted defendants. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 92</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 505 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Portion of Fee for Indigent Persons' Attorney Fee Fund Is Cost of Prosecution.
   
   - Because the appointment fee provided for by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1(a)</a></cite> functions to reimburse the State for expenses associated with keeping its system that provides for court-appointed counsel operational, the portion of the appointment fee allocated for the North Carolina Indigent Persons' Attorney Fee Fund is a cost of prosecution, and cannot be characterized as being, in part, an attorney's fee. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 92</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 505 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Portion of Fee for Court Information Technology Fund Is Facilities Fee.
   
   - Portion of the appointment fee provided for by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1(a)</a></cite> allocated to the North Carolina Court Information Technology Fund is effectively indistinguishable from the facilities fee imposed under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIa28s7A-304ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7A-304(a)(2)</a></cite>; the appointment fee operates to supplement funds otherwise available to the North Carolina Judicial Department for court information technology and office automation needs, thus defraying expenses incurred by the State in the operation and maintenance of the court system under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsVIIa29s7A-343.2" target="_self">G.S. 7A-343.2</a></cite>, and it should be assessed in the same manner as the facilities fee and any other cost of prosecution - against convicted defendants only. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 92</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 505 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appointment fee is not fee, but costs
   
   - Mere use of the term "fee" does not determine the true nature of an appointment fee under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_self">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite>, as every aspect of the appointment fee is one associated with a cost; in fact, each amount listed on the North Carolina Criminal Bill of Costs submitted in a criminal matter is denominated a "fee," for example, process fee, general court of justice fee, facilities fee, and these fees are, like costs, imposed only upon convicted defendants. Furthermore, the definition of "costs" includes "fees" as a synonym. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 92</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 505 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice And Opportunity to Object Required.
   
   - Because defendant was not given notice of the appointment of counsel fee and an opportunity to object to the imposition of the fee at his sentencing hearing, the appointment fee was vacated without prejudice to the State again seeking appointment fee on remand. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 805 S.E.2d 729 (2017).

        Right Against Self-Incrimination.
   
   - Trial court erred by admitting defendant's affidavit of indigency into evidence because in doing so, it required defendant to surrender his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination in order to assert his right to the assistance of counsel, as his statement of his date of birth on his affidavit was testimonial because he was charged with abduction of a child and statutory rape. However, the error was harmless because neither charge required the State to prove defendant's exact age and the victim's testimony established that defendant was 19 years old and she was 14 when the crimes occurred. State v. Diaz, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 493</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 532 (2019).

       <p>
        Insufficient Evidence.
   
   - When defendant was charged with false statements for executing an affidavit of indigency stating that he had no interest in real property when his girlfriend had placed his name on a deed of trust on property she owned, his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence because the affidavit asked for assets in realty but did not ask if he owned land, and there was no evidence he had assets in the property he co-owned with his girlfriend or that he was asked to clarify his answer on his affidavit.

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Prior to the passage of this Article it was unquestioned that an accused could waive his right to counsel
   
   at in-custody proceedings, either orally or in writing, if he did so freely, voluntarily and understandingly. State v. Chance, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 643</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 227 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 940, 92 S. Ct. 2878, 33 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to the enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-450" target="_self">G.S. 7A-450</a></cite> et seq., there was no difference in the requirements for a waiver of counsel by indigents and nonindigents. Each could waive the right either orally or in writing. State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 1</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 561 (1971).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         The purpose of the statutory provision for appointment of counsel,
   
   at public expense, for indigent defendants is to put indigent defendants on an equality with affluent defendants in trials upon criminal charges. To deny or restrict the right of the indigent to waive counsel, i.e., to represent himself, while permitting the affluent defendant to exercise such right, has no reasonable relation to the objective of equal opportunity to prevail at the trial of the case. Such classification is beyond the power of the legislature. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).

         The rule is that one may waive counsel if he does so freely and voluntarily
   
   and with full understanding that he has the right to be represented by an attorney. State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 1</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 561 (1971).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         But Waiver Must Be Specifically Made After Miranda Warnings.
   
   - No effective waiver of the right to counsel during interrogation can be recognized unless specifically made after the Miranda warnings. Silence and waiver are not synonymous. Presuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible. The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver. State v. Blackmon, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 1</cite>, 199 S.E.2d 431 (1973).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         And waiver of counsel may not be presumed from a silent record.
   
   State v. Moses, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 191 S.E.2d 368 (1972); State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 427</cite>, 383 S.E.2d 910 (1989).
   <br />

        <p>
         This section presupposes that a defendant has been informed of his rights and given an opportunity to act on the information as provided in G.S.
   
   15A-603. This involves a determination of defendant's indigency and entitlement to court appointed counsel. However, whether or not a defendant is indigent, any waiver must be in accordance with this section, notwithstanding the limiting language thereof. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 309 S.E.2d 721 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         A defendant who appears without counsel at his arraignment must be properly informed of his rights in the manner required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsVIa29s15A-603" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-603</a></cite>. Where the defendant nevertheless wishes to waive counsel, the court must find that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsVIa29s15A-603" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-603</a></cite> has been complied with before a valid waiver can be made.

   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Waiver Was Knowing and Voluntary.
   
   - The defendant's waiver of appointed counsel and his decision to proceed pro se were knowing and voluntary, where he completed a waiver of counsel form that followed the statute and was certified by the trial court. State v. Love, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 507 S.E.2d 577 (1998), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 586</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 382 (1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in allowing defendant to represent himself because the court complied with the statutory requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-457" target="_self">G.S. 7A-457</a></cite> prior to allowing such self-representation, by obtaining a written waiver of counsel after considering the statutory requirements. State v. Davis, - N.C. App.

   - , cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 170</cite>, 568 S.E.2d 623 (2002).

         Investigators did not violate <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-451" target="_self">G.S. 7A-451</a></cite> and 7A-457, or Rules and Regulations Relating to the Appointment of Counsel for Indigent Defendants in Certain Criminal Cases 2A.2(a) by continuing to question defendant after appointed provisional counsel arrived at the sheriff's office and requested to see defendant where defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights, initialed the form, and did not request an attorney at any time before he made a statement. While Rule 2A.2(a) authorized provisional counsel to seek access to a potential capital defendant, it did not require law enforcement to provide that access because defendant had validly waived his rights. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 103</cite>, 711 S.E.2d 122 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1541, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 1493, 182 L. Ed. 2d 176 (U.S. 2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         It was no error to let defendant proceed pro se at a probation revocation hearing because (1) the court explained the charges, proceedings, and possible sentence and explained defendant's right to assigned counsel, in response to which defendant clearly and unequivocally asked to represent himself, (2) defendant said he understood the consequences of representing himself, and (3) he was 23 years old, spoke English, had a G.E.D. degree, had attended college, had no known mental defects, and did not have to navigate complex evidentiary or procedural rules. State v. Faulkner, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 792 S.E.2d 836 (2016).

         Trial Court's Findings of Waiver.
   
   - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-457" target="_self">G.S. 7A-457</a></cite> does not require a trial court, accepting an indigent defendant's waiver of counsel, to specifically find and state that it considered defendant's age, education, familiarity with the English language, mental condition and the complexity of the crime charged but, rather, requires the trial court only to consider those factors when determining whether defendant's waiver of counsel was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. State v. Fulp, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 171</cite>, 558 S.E.2d 156 (2002).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Necessity for Evidence or Findings of Waiver.
   
   - Admission of a defendant's inculpatory statement to the police was erroneous where there was neither evidence nor findings to show that defendant had waived his right to counsel as provided by this section. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 100</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 756 (1972), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Waiver Is Required Only Where Defendant Is Subjected to In-Custody Interrogation.
   
   - Miranda warnings and waiver of counsel are only required where defendant is being subjected to custodial interrogation. State v. Blackmon, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 1</cite>, 199 S.E.2d 431 (1973).

        <p>
         Stringency of Requiring Waiver in Writing.
   
   - In imposing the requirement that an indigent's waiver of counsel must be in writing, the North Carolina General Assembly imposed a more stringent requirement than the federal courts have done. State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 1</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 561 (1971).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Words "in writing" in subsection (a) are directory only
   
   and not mandatory. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 211 S.E.2d 539 (1975).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Lack of Written Waiver.
   
   - The fact that there is no written waiver neither alters the conclusion that the waiver was knowing and voluntary, nor invalidates the waiver. State v. Heatwole, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 1</cite>, 473 S.E.2d 310 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1122, 117 S. Ct. 1259, 137 L. Ed. 2d 339 (1997).
        </p>
        <p>
         Indigent defendant's waiver of counsel was not invalid because there was no written record of the waiver, in spite of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsIXa36s7A-457" target="_self">G.S. 7A-457</a></cite>'s requirement of a written waiver, because the requirement is directory, rather than mandatory, as long as the provisions of the statute were otherwise followed. State v. Fulp, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 171</cite>, 558 S.E.2d 156 (2002).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Waiver at Out-of-Court Proceeding No Longer Required to Be in Writing.
   
   - The General Assembly, by Session Laws 1971, c. 1243, amended this section so as to relax the requirement that a waiver of counsel must be in writing. State v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 118</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 750 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Printing Name Rather Than Writing It.
   
   - The fact that defendant printed his name instead of signing it to a waiver of rights form was without legal significance and did not warrant suppression of in-custody statements of defendant. State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 1</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 203 (1977).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Refusal to Sign Waiver of Counsel Will Not Defeat Determination That Counsel Was Properly Waived.
   
   - When all of the provisions of this section have been otherwise fully complied with, and the indigent defendant has refused to accept court-appointed counsel, his refusal to sign a waiver of counsel will not defeat a determination that such defendant freely, voluntarily and understandingly waived in-court representation by counsel, and in such case the State may proceed with the trial of the indigent defendant without counsel. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 211 S.E.2d 539 (1975), overruled on other grounds, State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 539</cite>, 380 S.E.2d 118 (1989).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Refusal to sign a written waiver is a fact which may tend to show that no waiver occurred,
   
   but it is not conclusive in the face of other evidence tending to show waiver. State v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 553</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 600 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         A refusal to sign a waiver form does not necessarily preclude a valid oral waiver. State v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 553</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 600 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         The waiver in writing once given is good and sufficient
   
   until the proceeding is finally terminated, unless the defendant himself makes known to the court that he desires to withdraw the waiver and have counsel assigned to him. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 204 S.E.2d 537, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 595</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 866 (1974).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         The burden of showing the change in the desire of the defendant for counsel
   
   rests upon the defendant. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 204 S.E.2d 537, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 595</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 866 (1974).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         This section does not require successive waivers in writing at every court level
   
   of the proceeding, and trial in district court and trial in superior court on appeal constitute one in-court proceeding. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 204 S.E.2d 537, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 595</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 866 (1974).

         No waiver is involved with respect to volunteered statements.

   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         A volunteered confession is admissible by constitutional standards even in the absence of warning or waiver of rights,
   
   since an indigent's right to or waiver of counsel under this section does not arise and is not involved with respect to volunteered statements. State v. Blackmon, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 1</cite>, 199 S.E.2d 431 (1973).

        <p>
         Defendant's volunteered confession would have been admissible by constitutional standards even in the absence of warning or waiver of his rights. State v. Haddock, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 675</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 208 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influence is admissible
   
   in evidence. The fundamental import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated. State v. Haddock, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 675</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 208 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         Assuming defendant's indigency, the presence of counsel was not required, because defendant's statement at the police station was not the result of an in-custody interrogation initiated by the officers. Rather, it was defendant's own voluntary narration, freely and understandingly related. State v. Haddock, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 675</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 208 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although defendant was in custody at the time he made the incriminating statements, where his statements were not made in response to police "interrogation," as that word is defined in Miranda, but were more in the nature of volunteered assertions and narrations, his statements were admissible. State v. Blackmon, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 1</cite>, 199 S.E.2d 431 (1973).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where there was no evidence of any interrogation or other police procedure tending to overbear defendant's will and defendant spoke in the voluntary exercise of his own will and without the slightest compulsion of in-custody interrogation procedures, his statements were properly admitted into evidence as volunteered statements made under circumstances requiring neither warnings nor the presence of counsel. State v. Blackmon, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 1</cite>, 199 S.E.2d 431 (1973).

         Right of Defendant to Represent Himself.
   
   - A defendant in a criminal proceeding has a right to handle his own case without interference by, or the assistance of, counsel forced upon him against his wishes. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         The United States Constitution does not deny to a defendant the right to defend himself. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         Having been fully advised by the court that an attorney would be appointed to represent him if he so desired, the defendant had the right to reject the offer of such appointment and to represent himself in the trial and disposition of his case. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Appointment of Counsel for Limited Purpose Where Defendant Represents Himself.
   
   - Defendant was not prejudiced in any respect by the appointment of counsel for the limited purpose of furnishing advice to him if so requested, even though defendant waived counsel and conducted his own defense. State v. Harper, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 30, 202 S.E.2d 795, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 375</cite>, 205 S.E.2d 100 (1974).

         Failure to Interrogate Defendant Entering Plea of Guilty.
   
   - Failure on the part of the trial judge to follow the recommended procedure that he interrogate every defendant, whether represented by counsel or not, who enters a plea of guilty, in order to be sure that he has freely, voluntarily and intelligently consented to and authorized the entry of such plea, is not fatal to a conviction. This rule has not been modified by this section. However, when a defendant who is represented by counsel tenders a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere it must appear affirmatively in the record that he did so voluntarily and understandingly. State v. Ford, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 62</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 741 (1972).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Failure to Inform Defendant Pleading Nolo Contendere of Minimum Sentence.
   
   - Where the trial court informed defendant that he could be imprisoned for as much as 30 years upon his plea of nolo contendere to a charge of armed robbery, the failure of the court to inform defendant that the minimum sentence was five years did not vitiate defendant's plea of nolo contendere. State v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 367, 188 S.E.2d 607 (1972).

       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       The fee to which an attorney who represents an indigent person is entitled shall be fixed in accordance with rules adopted by the Office of Indigent Defense Services. Fees shall be based on the factors normally considered in fixing attorneys' fees, such as the nature of the case, and the time, effort and responsibility involved. Fees shall not be set or ordered at rates higher than those established by the rules adopted under this section without the approval of the Office of Indigent Defense Services. Even if the trial, appeal, hearing or other proceeding is never held, preparation therefor is nevertheless compensable and, in capital cases and other extraordinary cases pending in superior court, a fee for services rendered and payment for expenses incurred may be allowed pending final determination of the case.

       - Session Laws 2014-100, s. 18A.1, provides: "The Office of Indigent Defense Services, in consultation and cooperation with the Office of the State Controller and the Office of State Budget and Management, shall develop and implement a plan for making certain information contained in fee applications by attorneys publicly available online. The plan shall provide for online access to the following information with respect to each fee application filed: the name of the attorney filing the application, the case number and the county, the class of the highest charge against the defendant, an indication as to whether there are multiple charges against the defendant, the judge who approved the fee application, the amount paid to the attorney through the application, and the date of that payment. In the case of fee applications that cover work paid by the session rather than by the case, the plan shall provide for identification of those applications by session. The plan shall require (i) the information to be updated at least biweekly, (ii) the information to be searchable, and (iii) all information regarding capital cases to be clearly labeled as such. The Office of Indigent Defense Services shall report on its progress in developing this plan to the Chairs of the Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittees on Justice and Public Safety by October 1, 2014.

        Amount Discretionary.
   
   - Amount of an award of indigent counsel fees is discretionary with the trial court. State v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 229, 468 S.E.2d 840 (1996).

        Calculation of Costs for Appointed Counsel.
   
   - Costs of defendant's appointed counsel for both the Class G felony and the Class D felony were the same, and were calculated at the same rate of $70 per hour rate for Class D felonies because the appropriate attorney's fee rate was properly based upon the most serious charge, the Class D felony; and the Office of Indigent Defense Services rules and regulations did not allow for separating the hours spent by appointed counsel for individual charges, all work done for each individual charge was considered work done for every charge, as part of the same case; thus, the appropriate cost of appointed counsel for the Class G charge was 51.73 hours at the $70 Class D felony rate. State v. Charleston, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 671, 789 S.E.2d 513 (2016).

   with the trial or appellate court, and failure to appoint or continue the appointment of associate counsel will be held error only when it amounts to a clear abuse of that discretion, i.e., only when it is denied in the face of a showing by defendant of a reasonable likelihood that additional counsel would materially assist in the preparation of his defense, or that without such help it was probable that defendant would not receive a fair trial.

      <p>
       There is created an Office of Administrative Hearings. The Office of Administrative Hearings is an independent, quasi-judicial agency under Article III, Sec. 11 of the Constitution and, in accordance with Article IV, Sec. 3 of the Constitution, has such judicial powers as may be reasonably necessary as an incident to the accomplishment of the purposes for which it is created. The Office of Administrative Hearings is established to ensure that administrative decisions are made in a fair and impartial manner to protect the due process rights of citizens who challenge administrative action and to provide a source of independent administrative law judges to conduct administrative hearings in contested cases in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes and thereby prevent the commingling of legislative, executive, and judicial functions in the administrative process. It shall also maintain dockets and records of contested cases and shall codify and publish all administrative rules.

        Editor's Note.
       </b>
       - Session Laws 1985, c. 746, s. 18.1 directed the substitution of "Attorney General" for "Chief Justice" in the first sentence of the first paragraph, but s. 19 of c. 746 made this amendment effective only if the Supreme Court issued an advisory opinion that the appointment of the chief hearing officer by the Chief Justice was unconstitutional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 18.2 of Session Laws 1985, c. 746, provided: "The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall request the Supreme Court to issue an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of Sections 5 and 6 of this act and the appointment of the chief hearing officer by the Chief Justice as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsXIIa60s7A-752" target="_self">G.S. 7A-752</a></cite> in Section 2 of this act."
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter of October 28, 1985, addressed to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, the Supreme Court declined to issue an advisory opinion as contemplated by Session Laws 1985, c. 746, on the grounds that to issue such an opinion would be to place the Court directly in the stream of the legislative process, and in view of the prerogative of the General Assembly to first address and determine the constitutionality of its own legislation. See In re Advisory Opinion, - N.C.
   - , 335 S.E.2d 890 (1985).

        The Office of Administrative Hearings is designated to serve as the State's deferral agency for cases deferred by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to the Office of Administrative Hearings as provided in Section 706 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. for charges filed by State or local government employees covered under Chapter 126 of the General Statutes and shall have all of the powers and authority necessary to function as a deferral agency.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsXIIa60s7A-759ol1b">
        The Chief Administrative Law Judge is authorized and directed to contract with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for the Office of Administrative Hearings to serve as a deferral agency and to establish and maintain a Civil Rights Division in the Office of Administrative Hearings to carry out the functions of a deferral agency.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsXIIa60s7A-759ol1-b1">
        As provided in the contract between the Office of Administrative Hearings and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a deferred charge for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(c) or (d) is a charge that is filed by a State or local government employee covered under Chapter 126 of the General Statutes and alleges an unlawful employment practice prohibited under that Chapter or any other State law. A deferred charge may be filed with either agency.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsXIIa60s7A-759ol1c">
        In investigating charges an employee of the Civil Rights Division of the Office of Administrative Hearings specifically designated by an order of the Chief Administrative Law Judge filed in the pending case may administer oaths and affirmations.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsXIIa60s7A-759ol1-c1">
        In investigating charges, an employee of the Civil Rights Division shall have access at reasonable times to State premises, records, and documents relevant to the charge and shall have the right to examine, photograph, and copy evidence. Any challenge to the Civil Rights Division to investigate the deferred charge shall not constitute grounds for denial or refusal to produce or allow access to the investigative evidence.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsXIIa60s7A-759ol1d">
        Any charge not resolved by informal methods of conference, conciliation or persuasion may be heard as a contested case as provided in Article 3 of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsXIIa60s7A-759ol1e">
        An order entered by an administrative law judge after a contested case hearing on the merits of a deferred charge is a final agency decision and is binding on the parties. The administrative law judge may order whatever remedial action is appropriate to give full relief consistent with the requirements of federal statutes or regulations or State statutes or rules.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsXIIa60s7A-759ol1f">
        In addition to the authority vested in G.S. 7A-756 and G.S. 150B-33, an administrative law judge may monitor compliance with any negotiated settlement, conciliation agreement or order entered in a deferred case.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsXIIa60s7A-759ol1g">
        The standards of confidentiality established by federal statute or regulation for discrimination charges shall apply to deferred cases investigated or heard by the Office of Administrative Hearings.
       </li>
       <li id="t7AsXIIa60s7A-759ol1h">
        Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the authority or right of any federal agency to act under any federal statute or regulation.

        This section shall be broadly construed to further the general purposes stated in this section and the specific purposes of the particular provisions involved.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The date a deferred charge is filed with either agency is considered to be a commencement of proceedings under State law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(c) or (d). The filing of a deferred charge automatically tolls the time limit under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.126.html#t126a02s126-7.2" target="_blank">G.S. 126-7.2</a></cite>, 126-35, 126-38, and 150B-23(f) and any other State law that sets a time limit for filing a contested case under Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes alleging an unlawful employment practice. These time limits are tolled until the completion of the investigation and of any informal methods of resolution pursued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.

        - Where a complainant steadfastly maintained that he had brought only a Title VII (of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) claim and the state referral agency unequivocally addressed only that claim, proceedings under state law had not commenced for purposes of 42 U.S.C.S.

        Where state law protects persons against the kind of discrimination alleged under federal law, complainants are required to resort to state and local remedies before they may proceed to the EEOC, and then to federal court.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the employee's action was commenced under state law when the employee filed with the EEOC, the employee did not need to file a discrimination claim with the state agency and no tolling was necessary; thus the employer's motion to reconsider was denied.

        A judge presiding over a case in which the offender meets the criteria set forth in G.S. 7A-773(1) may request, at any time prior to the imposition of sentence, that the sentencing services program provide a sentencing plan. The court may also request, at any time prior to the imposition of sentence, that the program provide a sentencing plan in misdemeanor cases in which the class of offense is Class A1 or Class 1 and the prior conviction level is Level III, if the court determines that the preparation of such a plan is in the interest of justice. In addition, in cases in which the offender meets the criteria set forth in G.S. 7A-773, the defendant or a prosecutor, at any time before the court has accepted a guilty plea or received a guilty verdict, may request that the program provide a plan. However, prior to an adjudication of guilt, a defendant may decline to participate in the preparation of a plan within a reasonable time after the request is made. In that case, no plan shall be prepared or presented to the court by the sentencing services program prior to an adjudication of guilt. A defendant's decision not to participate shall be made in writing and filed with the court. The comprehensive sentencing services program plan prepared pursuant to G.S. 7A-774 shall define what constitutes a reasonable time within the meaning of this subsection.

       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 2009-355, s. 4, effective October 1, 2009, was codified as this section by the Revisor of Statutes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2009-355 was an act to enhance protections against identity theft and to protect the credit of crime victims. Although s. 4 of Session Laws 2009-355, references "implementing this act," it appears that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.132.html#t132s132-1.10" target="_blank">G.S. 132-1.10(f1)</a></cite>, as added by s. 3 of Session Laws 2009-355, may have been the intended reference since subsection (f1) is the only part of the act that pertains to the clerks and the registers of deeds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7AsXIIIa63s7A-809" target="_self">G.S. 7A-809</a></cite> pertained to reporting results of the study.

      Effect of Amendments.
   
   - Session Laws 2010-96, s. 1, effective July 20, 2010, substituted "G.S. 132-1.10(f1)" for "Session Laws 2009-355."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2014-100, s. 18B.1(c), effective July 1, 2014, rewrote the section.
