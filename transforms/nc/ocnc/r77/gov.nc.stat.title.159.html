                            Each local government and public authority shall operate under an annual balanced budget ordinance adopted and administered in accordance with this Article. A budget ordinance is balanced when the sum of estimated net revenues and appropriated fund balances
                            is equal to appropriations. Appropriated fund balance in any fund shall not exceed the sum of cash and investments minus the sum of liabilities, encumbrances, and deferred revenues arising from cash receipts, as those figures
                            stand at the close of the fiscal year next preceding the budget year. It is the intent of this Article that, except for moneys expended pursuant to a project ordinance or accounted for in an intragovernmental service fund or
                            a trust and agency fund excluded from the budget ordinance under G.S. 159-13(a), all moneys received and expended by a local government or public authority should be included in the budget ordinance. Therefore, notwithstanding
                            any other provision of law, no local government or public authority may expend any moneys, regardless of their source (including moneys derived from bond proceeds, federal, state, or private grants or loans, or special assessments),
                            except in accordance with a budget ordinance or project ordinance adopted under this Article or through an intragovernmental service fund or trust and agency fund properly excluded from the budget ordinance.

                            the Commission does permit an authority to operate under an altered fiscal year, the Commission's order shall also modify the budget calendar set forth in G.S. 159-10 through 159-13 so as to provide a new budget calendar for
                            the altered fiscal year that will clearly enable the authority to comply with the intent of this Part.

                            Detailed Accounts to Be Kept. - Under the provisions of the former County Fiscal Control Act, it was the duty of a county accountant to keep detailed accounts of appropriations and disbursements of county funds and to certify on each warrant or order
                            drawn against the county that provision had been made for its payment and appropriation duly made or a bond or note duly authorized as required by the act. Avery County v. Braswell, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 270</cite>,

                            Certification of Vouchers. - The duties of a county accountant in certifying county vouchers under the former County Fiscal Control Act were special in character and were in addition to and not in substitution for the duties and functions of other county
                            officers, and even if it were conceded that the signing of the voucher by the chairman of the county board was malfeasance, the accountant and his surety could not avoid liability on the ground that some other officer was guilty
                            of negligence or malfeasance. Avery County v. Braswell, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 270</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 864 (1939).

                            officers, claim sovereign immunity as a defense to its statutory and contractual commitment. Hubbard v. County of Cumberland, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 544 S.E.2d 587, cert.

                            therefor are repealed. No special, local, or private act enacted or taking effect after July 1, 1973, may be construed to modify, amend, or repeal any portion of this Article unless it expressly so provides by specific reference
                            to the appropriate section of this Article.

                            Provisions Governing General Obligation Bond Must Be Followed. - When an ordinance regulating a public enterprise is adopted by a local government to finance the public enterprise, the procedures supplied in the General Statutes for adopting such an ordinance
                            must likewise be followed; when a general obligation bond is issued by a local government, the provisions of this Chapter must be followed; and when a local government purchases equipment, the applicable statutes regarding
                            competitive bidding, where applicable, must likewise be followed. There is no statute or law that mandates notice and hearing requirements for ordinances requiring mandatory connections and fixing related connection charges

                            the faith and credit of the county. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

                            Authorization of Tax Distinguished from Approval of Order Imposing Tax. - Where the ballot that the voters considered indicated that the voters were asked only to authorize a tax rather than to approve an order imposing a tax, the County Commissioners
                            were not compelled to impose a tax and were free, under these facts, to charge reasonable fees and charges to repay the bonds in lieu of the levy of a tax. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>,

                            and where other relevant statutes had been duly followed, the bonds so issued were a valid obligation of the town issuing them, and their issuance would not be enjoined by the courts. Burleson v. Board of Aldermen,

                            Applicability. - A fair reading of the language of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t159sIVa04s159-54" target="_self">G.S. 159-54</a></cite> indicates that this Act applies to general obligation bonds which pledge
                            the faith and credit of the county. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

                            The bond order is the crucial foundation document which supports and explains the proposal to be submitted, and material representations set out in the bond order ordinarily become essential elements of the proposition submitted to the voters. Rider v.
                            Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 620</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 913 (1952).

                            Stipulation in Bond Order as Limitation on Subsequent Official Acts. - Where bond order contains a stipulation definitely fixing the maximum amount of county funds to be expended on a proposed project, such stipulation, treated as a compact, becomes a
                            limitation upon subsequent official acts based on a favorable vote and may not be materially varied. Rider v. Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 620</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 913 (1952).

                            Provision Becoming Part of Bonds. - A provision set out in former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t159sIVa04s159-46" target="_self">G.S. 159-46</a></cite> and incorporated in an ordinance authorizing the issuance of bonds entered
                            into and became an integral part of the bonds when issued, with contractual force and effect, which could not be impaired by subsequent legislation. Nash v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 301</cite>, 190 S.E.

                            Use of Proceeds of Bonds Limited by Bond Order. - Where a bond order approved by the voters of a county authorized the issuance of bonds in an aggregate amount to finance a new building or buildings to be used as a public hospital and the acquisition
                            of a suitable site therefor, the use of the proceeds of the bonds was limited by the bond order, and the county could not use the surplus left after completing the project contemplated in the bond order toward the construction
                            of a clinic in another municipality of the county. Lewis v. Beaufort County, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 628</cite>, 107 S.E.2d 77 (1959).

                        <p>
                            No Substantial Deviation from Purpose Found. - Where the manifest purpose for which a civic center bond issue was proposed was to revitalize the downtown area, with the civic center becoming the catalyst for other projects, and the site finally chosen
                            by the city council remained in the downtown area, although at a distance of approximately four blocks from the site noted in speeches by public officials before the election, there was not a substantial deviation from the
                            purpose for which the bonds were proposed. Sykes v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Misrepresentations made as to the site of the civic center for construction of which a bond issue to be paid by taxes was proposed did not vitiate the question as submitted to the voters in the bond issue election. Sykes v. Belk,
                            <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Use of Funds for Hospital "Buildings". - Where the resolution of the county commissioners in submitting to a vote the question of issuing bonds for a public hospital used the word "buildings," and it was later found that a surplus would remain after the
                            erection and equipment of the main hospital building, such surplus could be used for the purpose of erecting on the hospital grounds a home for nurses, technicians and others engaged in essential employment incidental to the
                            proper operation of the hospital. Worley v. Johnston County, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 592</cite>, 58 S.E.2d 99 (1950).

                            Intent to Use Funds for Construction of Water and Sewer Lines in Annexed Areas. - Where there was no irregularity in the authorization of municipal bonds for its water and sewer systems, and in the city's notice of intent to annex certain areas it was
                            stated that the city intended to use certain of the proceeds of the bonds for the construction of water and sewer lines in areas intended to be annexed, the fact that neither the bond ordinance nor the ballots used in the election
                            at which the issuance of the bonds was approved disclosed such intent did not affect the validity of the bonds. Upchurch v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 676</cite>, 114 S.E.2d
                            772 (1960).

                        <p>
                            A bond order may contain several sections and authorize the issue of bonds for different purposes. Atkins v. McAden, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 752</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 484 (1949).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bond order need not set out in detail estimates of cost and descriptions of the particular projects for which the funds are proposed to be used, and their inclusion does not limit the allocation of the proceeds of the bonds, provided the use of the funds
                            falls within the general purpose designated. Atkins v. McAden, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 752</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 484 (1949).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nor Specify That Public Funds Will Supplement Bond Moneys. - Where public funds are to supplement bond moneys, it is not required that the bond order specify, or the voters be advised, that the proceeds of the proposed bond issue are to be used with,
                            or in addition to, a sum of money on hand or otherwise available for the proposed improvement. Rider v. Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 620</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 913 (1952).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But Where Order Stipulates Total Sum to Be Expended, Appropriation of Additional Sum Is Unauthorized. - While a county may ordinarily expend unallocated nontax moneys for the public purpose of a county hospital even in those instances in which a bond
                            order for the hospital does not specify that the proceeds of the bonds are to be used together with such unallocated nontax moneys, where the bond order specifically specified that the total maximum amount to be expended by
                            the county for the hospital was not to exceed $465,000, the allocation of an additional supplemental appropriation of over $138,000 out of nontax moneys on hand was a material variance from the compact as set forth in the bond
                            order, and the county could be restrained in a proper suit from issuing the bonds and disbursing county funds in accordance with hospital plans predicated upon such increased appropriation. Rider v. Lenoir County,
                            <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 620</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 913 (1952).

                        <p>
                            Amount and Manner of Assessment Against Each Abutting Owner Need Not Be Set Forth. - It is not required that a bond ordinance of a municipality set forth in express terms the proportion of the cost of the proposed improvements which has been, or is to
                            be, assessed against the property of each owner abutting upon the streets to be improved, or the terms and method of making the payment, if the procedure follow the direction of the statutes relating to the subject. Leak v.
                            Town of Wadesboro, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 683</cite>, 121 S.E. 12 (1923).

                            A tax must be levied only if revenue from other sources is inadequate to repay the principal and interest on the bonds outstanding. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

                        <p>
                            Repayment of Bonds by Charging Reasonable Fees. - Where the ballot that the voters considered indicated that the voters were asked only to authorize a tax rather than to approve an order imposing a tax, the County Commissioners were not compelled to impose
                            a tax and were free, under these facts, to charge reasonable fees and charges to repay the bonds in lieu of the levy of a tax. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>,
                            398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

                        authority of any county, city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects. This amendment
                        was submitted to the people on November 2, 1993 and was defeated. The amendment to subsection (a) of this section, therefore, never took effect.

                        Effect of Amendments. - Session Laws 2013-381, s. 10.26, effective January 1, 2014, in subsection (b), added "only on a date permitted by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a23s163-287" target="_blank">G.S. 163-287</a></cite>"
                        at the end of the first sentence, deleted the former second and third sentences, which read: "The governing board may call a special referendum for the purpose of voting on a bond issue on any day, including the day of any regular
                        or special election held for another purpose (unless the law under which the bond referendum or other election is held specifically prohibits submission of other questions at the same time). A special bond referendum may not be
                        held within 30 days before or 10 days after a statewide primary, election, or referendum, or within 30 days before or 10 days after any other primary, election, or referendum to be held in the same unit holding the bond referendum
                        and already validly called or scheduled by law at the time the bond referendum is called." and deleted the former next-to-last sentence, which read: "In fixing the date of a bond referendum, the governing board shall consult the
                        board of elections in order that the referendum shall not unduly interfere with other elections already scheduled or in process." For applicability, see Editor's note.

                            Validity of Elections Favored. - It is the general rule that every reasonable presumption will be indulged in favor of the validity of elections, and the courts will uphold the validity of municipal bond elections unless clear grounds are shown for invalidating
                            them. Sykes v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).

                            The result of an election as determined by the proper election officials shall stand until it shall be regularly contested and reversed by a tribunal having jurisdiction for that purpose. The court will not permit itself to be substituted for the proper
                            election officials in the first instance for the purpose of canvassing the returns from the officers holding the election and declaring the result thereof. Garner v. Town of Newport, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 449</cite>,

                            Necessity of Notice. - While, so far as the officers are concerned who are charged with the duty of giving notice, the requirement as to notice is imperative, yet it will be regarded, otherwise, as directory, if the result would not be changed by a departure
                            from the provisions of the statute. The law looks more to the substance than to the form, and if it appears that a clear majority of the qualified voters have cast their votes in favor of the proposition submitted to them,
                            and that there has been a fair and full opportunity for all to vote, and that there has been no fraud, and the election is in all respects free from taint of any sort, so that no well founded suspicion can be cast upon it,
                            it would be idle to say that this free and untrammeled expression of the popular will should be disregarded and set aside. Hill v. Skinner, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 405</cite>, 86 S.E. 351

                            Submission of More Than One Question or Proposal at Same Election. - While former G.S. 153-93 permitted the submission of more than one question or proposal in one and the same election, this contemplated questions authorized by law. Parker v. Anson County,
                            <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 78</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 338 (1953).

                            Ballot Held to Comply with Statute. - A ballot for a school bond election which stated the question submitted for approval or disapproval, followed by a brief statement of the purposes for which the proceeds of the proposed bonds were to be used and that
                            a tax would be levied to pay the principal and interest on the bonds in event of approval, followed by the word "Yes" and the word "No" and a square opposite each, with instructions as to how the ballot should be marked, was
                            held to comply with former G.S. 153-96 and G.S. 163-150, and the fact that the number of proposed projects necessarily resulted in a ballot somewhat longer than usual was not objectionable. Parker v. Anson County,
                            <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 78</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 338 (1953).

                            Misrepresentations made as to the site of a civic center, for whose construction a bond issue to be paid by taxes was proposed, did not vitiate the question as submitted to the voters in the bond issue election. Sykes v. Belk,
                            <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).

                            Publication of Returns. - It is not necessary to the validity of an election that the returns be published, if it appears that no prejudice was sustained because of such failure. Board of Comm'rs v. C.M. Malone &amp; Co.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 604</cite>, 103 S.E. 134 (1920).

                            Necessary Allegations in Suit to Restrain Issuance of Bonds for Irregularities in Election. - In an action to restrain the issuance of bonds on the ground of irregularities in the bond election, a complaint which failed to allege that the officers appointed
                            to hold the election had reported the results thereof to the governing body of the municipality and that the governing body had canvassed the returns and judicially determined the result, as required by former G.S. 160-387,
                            was demurrable. Garner v. Town of Newport, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 449</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 505 (1957).

                        Bonds may be issued under a bond order at any time within seven years after the bond order takes effect. Such period may be extended prior to the expiration of such period from seven years to 10 years as hereinafter provided. The board of the issuing

                        A unit of local government may issue funding and refunding bonds under this Article for the purposes listed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t159sIVa04s159-48ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 159-48(a)(4)</a></cite>, (5), (6), or (7).
                        Funding bonds may be issued if the debt, judgment, or other obligation to be paid is payable at the time of the passage of the bond order or within one year thereafter. Refunding bonds may be issued at any time prior to the final
                        maturity of the debt or obligation to be refunded. The proceeds from the sale of any refunding bonds shall be applied only as follows: either (i) to the immediate payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded or (ii)
                        if not required for the immediate payment of the obligations being refunded such proceeds shall be deposited in trust to provide for the payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded, and to pay any expenses incurred
                        in connection with such refunding, but provision may be made for the pledging and disposition of any amounts in excess of the amounts required for such purposes, including, without limitation, provision for the pledging of any
                        such excess to the payment of the principal of and interest on any issue or series of refunding bonds issued pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t159sIVa04s159-78" target="_self">G.S. 159-78</a></cite>. Money in any such trust
                        fund may be invested in (i) direct obligations of the United States government, or (ii) obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by the United States government, or (iii) to the extent then permitted by
                        law in obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States government, or (iv) in certificates of deposit issued by a bank or trust company located in the State of North Carolina if such certificates shall be secured
                        by a pledge of any of said obligations described in (i), (ii), or (iii) above having an aggregate market value, exclusive of accrued interest, equal at least to the principal amount of the certificates so secured. Nothing herein
                        shall be construed as a limitation on the duration of any deposit in trust for the retirement of obligations being refunded but which shall not have matured and which shall not be presently redeemable or, if presently redeemable,
                        shall not have been called for redemption.

                            Statute Limiting Tax Rate of Municipality Held Inoperative Under Facts. - Where defendant municipality proposed to issue refunding bonds to be exchanged for like amounts of the original bonds in the hands of the holders of the original indebtedness, the
                            refunding bonds to be secured by all rights and powers of taxation which protected and formed a part of the obligation of the original bonds, it was held that the parties and the debt were the same and the transaction amounted
                            in reality to an extension and renewal of the original bonds under legislative sanction, and an act of the legislature, passed after the issuance of the original bonds, limiting the tax rate of the municipality was inoperative
                            as to the refunding bonds when the limitation therein imposed would prevent the payment of the refunding bonds according to their tenor; the contention that even though the refunding bonds would not create a new debt, such
                            debt would be evidenced by a new contract, and that therefore the refunding bonds would be subject to the limitation of the statute enacted prior to the issuance of the refunding bonds was untenable. Bryson City Bank v. Town

                            Service of Summons by Publication Sufficient. - The contention that an owner of taxable property within the unit, or a citizen residing therein, may be deprived of his property, without due process of law, or contrary to the law of the land, by a decree
                            or judgment in the action declaring or adjudging that bonds and the tax to be levied for their payment, are valid, because it is not required that his name shall appear in the summons or in the complaint, or that the summons

                        Purpose of the Revenue Bond Act of 1938 was to permit municipalities to engage in nongovernmental activities of a public nature by pledging the revenue derived from such undertakings to the payment of bonds issued in connection therewith. Thus the act
                        avoided pledging the credit of the municipality to the payment of a debt, for by such arrangements no debt was incurred within the meaning of the Constitution. Britt v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 446</cite>,

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The State and each municipality is hereby authorized to issue its revenue bonds in such principal amount as may be necessary to provide sufficient moneys for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, extension, betterment, improvement, or payment
                    of the cost of one or more revenue bond projects, including engineering, inspection, legal and financial fees and costs, working capital, interest on the bonds or notes issued in anticipation thereof during construction and, if deemed
                    advisable by the State or a municipality, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding two years after the estimated date of completion of construction, establishment of debt service reserves, and all other expenditures of the State
                    or the municipality, as the case may be, incidental and necessary or convenient thereto.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subject to agreements with the holders of its revenue bonds, the State or each municipality, as the case may be, may issue further revenue bonds and refund outstanding revenue bonds whether or not they have matured. Revenue bonds may be issued partly
                    for the purpose of refunding outstanding revenue bonds and partly for any other purpose under this Article. Revenue bonds issued to refund outstanding revenue bonds shall be issued under this Article and not Article 4 of this Chapter
                    or any other law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Refunding bonds may be issued at any time prior to the final maturity of the debt or obligation to be refunded. The proceeds from the sale of any refunding bonds shall be applied only as follows: either, (i) to the immediate payment and retirement of
                    the obligations being refunded or (ii) if not required for the immediate payment of the obligations being refunded such proceeds shall be deposited in trust to provide for the payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded,
                    and to pay any expenses incurred in connection with such refunding, but provision may be made for the pledging and disposition of any amounts in excess of the amounts required for such purposes, including, without limitation, provision
                    for the pledging of any such excess to the payment of the principal of and interest on any issue or series or [of] refunding bonds issued pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t159sIVa04s159-78" target="_self">G.S. 159-78</a></cite>.
                    Money in any such trust fund may be invested in (i) direct obligations of the United States government, or (ii) obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by the United States government, or (iii) to the extent
                    then permitted by law in obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States government, (iv) certificates of deposit issued by a bank or trust company located in the State of North Carolina if such certificates shall
                    be secured by a pledge of any of said obligations described in (i), (ii), or (iii) above having any aggregate market value, exclusive of accrued interest, equal at least to the principal amount of the certificates so secured. Nothing
                    herein shall be construed as a limitation on the duration of any deposit in trust for the retirement of obligations being refunded but which shall not have matured and which shall not be presently redeemable or, if presently redeemable,
                    shall not have been called for redemption.

                    Editor's Note. - Session Laws 2000-81, ss. 1-8, effective July 5, 2000, authorizes the issuance of State revenue bonds, not to exceed $40,000,000, to finance improvements to the water and sewer system for the Community of Butner and Camp Butner reservation.
                    Specifically, the bonds are for paying the costs of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, betterment, and extension of the water supply and distribution system and sewage collection and disposal system
                    and certain costs of issuance of the bonds. The bonds are to be issued in compliance with the State and Local Government Revenue Bond Act, pursuant to an order adopted by the Council of State under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t159sIVa05s159-88" target="_self">G.S. 159-88</a></cite>,
                    and are to be sold by the Local Government Commission pursuant to the provisions of Article 7 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159.html" target="_blank">Chapter 159</a></cite>. The bonds are tax exempt, excepting estate,
                    inheritance, or gift taxes, income taxes on the gain from transfer of securities, and franchise taxes. Section 7 of the act provides that the act is supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws. It, being necessary
                    for the health and welfare of the people of the State, is to be liberally construed. Section 7(d) contains a severability clause.

                        Invocation of Taxing Power Not Provided For. - Where defendant municipality, which owned and operated its own electric distributing system, proposed to issue bonds to obtain funds for the construction of a municipal hydroelectric generating plant to be

      </b> - An Article 6 entitled "Economic Development Financing Act" was enacted by Session Laws 1993, c. 497, s. 2, but was made effective upon certification of approval of an amendment to Article V of the Constitution of North
                    Carolina relating to the authority of any county, city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects.
                    Such an amendment was submitted to the people on November 2, 1993 and was defeated. This Article, therefore, never took effect.

                    laws dealing with transactions of the type contemplated by the act. Such an amendment was proposed by Session Laws 1981 (Reg. Sess., 1982), c. 1247, was submitted to the people on Nov. 2, 1982, and was defeated. The earlier Article
                    6, therefore, never took effect.

                    A unit of local government may not issue project development financing debt instruments under this Article unless the issue is approved by the Local Government Commission. The governing body of the issuing unit shall file with the secretary of the Commission
                    an application for Commission approval of the issue. At the time of application, the governing body shall publish a public notice of the application in a newspaper of general circulation in the unit of local government. The application
                    shall include any statements of facts and documents concerning the proposed debt instruments, development financing district, and development financing plan, and the financial condition of the unit, required by the secretary. The Commission
                    may prescribe the form of the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before accepting the application, the secretary may require the governing body or its representatives to attend a preliminary conference in order to discuss informally the proposed issue, district, and plan and the timing of the steps to be taken in issuing
                    the debt instruments. The development financing plan need not be adopted by the governing body at the time it files the application with the secretary. However, before the Commission may enter its order approving the debt instruments,
                    the governing body must adopt the plan and make the findings described in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t159sIVa06s159-105ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 159-105(b)(1)</a></cite> and (5).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After an application in proper form and order has been filed, and after a preliminary conference if one is required, the secretary shall notify the unit in writing that the application has been filed and accepted for submission to the Commission. The
                    secretary's statement is conclusive evidence that the unit has complied with this section.

      </b> - An amendment to this section by Session Laws 1993, c. 497, s. 6, was made effective upon certification of approval of an amendment to Article V of the Constitution of North Carolina relating to the authority of any county,
                    city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects. This amendment was submitted to the people on
                    November 2, 1993 and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, never took effect.

                        Law Authorizing Bond Issue Need Not Declare Proportion of Proceeds Applicable to Each Specific Purpose. - A law authorizing a bond issue for various purposes which does not declare what proportion of the proceeds of the bonds shall be applied to each
                        specific purpose is not void. Such matter may properly rest within the sound discretion of the municipal authorities. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149
                        (1971).

                        "Corporate Purpose." - A definition of corporate purpose cannot be static. Changing conditions require that application of the limitations be tempered with due recognition of the existing situation, so that the purpose for which the public body was organized
                        may be accomplished and enjoyment thereof by the public made possible. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Right to Transfer and Allocate Funds. - Former G.S. 153-107, relating to application of proceeds of county bonds, did not place a limitation upon the legal right to transfer or allocate funds from one project to another included within the general purpose
                        for which the bonds were issued. The inhibition contained in the statute was to prevent funds obtained for one general purpose from being transferred and used for another general purpose. For example, the statute prohibited the
                        use of funds derived from the sale of bonds to erect, repair and equip school buildings from being used to erect or repair a courthouse or a county home or some similar project. Atkins v. McAden, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 752</cite>,
                        51 S.E.2d 484 (1949); Mauldin v. McAden, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 501</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 647 (1951).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the municipality has a limited authority, under certain conditions, to transfer or allocate funds from one project to another included within the general purpose for which bonds are authorized, the transfer must be to a project included in the general
                        purpose as stated in the bond resolution, and the funds may be diverted to the proposed purposes only in the event the municipality finds in good faith that conditions have so changed since the bonds were authorized that proceeds
                        therefrom are no longer needed for the original purpose. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Effect of Including Specifics in Bond Order. - A bond order is not required to set out in detail the estimates of cost and descriptions of the particular projects for which the funds are proposed to be used, and their inclusion does not limit the allocation
                        of the proceeds of the bonds, provided the use of the funds falls within the general purpose designated. Atkins v. McAden, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 752</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 484 (1949).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Immaterial or Temporary Changes Consistent with General Purpose Not Unlawful. - While the law will not justify the use of the proceeds of a State or municipal bond issue for purposes other than those specified in the act authorizing the issue, it does
                        not follow that immaterial or temporary changes consistent with the general purpose of the legislative act should be interpreted as unlawful diversions of public funds. Coggins v. City of Asheville,
                        <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such changes as are necessary under existing conditions to accomplish the general purpose are not outlawed. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Minor Changes Are Expected If Conditions Change. - Bond ordinances are passed authorizing indebtedness for certain stated purposes. When an authorizing vote is required, the bond money is earmarked for the stated purposes. However, in planning large permanent
                        improvements the governing authorities look ahead to the future fulfillment of the construction plans. The authorities will inspect and examine the work as it progresses, and minor changes from time to time are expected if conditions
                        change and unforeseen developments occur. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Emphasis Is Placed on Final Result to Be Accomplished. - In construing statutory limitations upon the use of bond money for public improvements, emphasis is placed on the final result sought to be accomplished. Coggins v. City of Asheville,
                        <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Erection of Consolidated School Instead of Remodeling Old School. - Where a bond issue for the remodeling of the old school buildings in a county administrative unit was duly approved by the voters in an election, it was held that the board of county
                        commissioners had the legal authority to allocate funds from this bond issue to the erection of a proposed consolidated high school, since this was not a change which involved any change of purpose for which the bonds were issued,
                        but was only a change in the manner or method of accomplishing the original purpose. Feezor v. Siceloff, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 563</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 714 (1950).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With respect to the use of bond money, the court will not interfere with the exercise of discretionary powers of a municipal corporation unless its actions are so unreasonable and arbitrary as to amount to an abuse of discretion. Coggins v. City of Asheville,
                        <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No Substantial Deviation from the Purpose for Which Bonds Were Approved. - Although the taxpayers argued that the proposed ballot language for the 2004 Park Bonds was intended to preclude the use of the property as a professional baseball stadium, when
                        the 2004 Park Bond only restricted the expenditure of bond proceeds on a stadium for professional baseball, and the disbursed money was subsequently repaid, there was no substantial deviation from the purpose for which the bonds
                        were approved under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t159sIVa07s159-135" target="_self">G.S. 159-135</a></cite>. Further, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa12s160A-265" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-265</a></cite>,
                        made applicable to counties by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html#t153Aa08s153A-176" target="_blank">G.S. 153A-176</a></cite>, stated that counties may: (i) hold, use, change the use thereof to other uses;
                        or (ii) sell or dispose of real and personal property, without regard to the method or purpose of its acquisition or to its intended or actual governmental or other prior use.

                        may require the governing body of the unit or its representatives to attend a preliminary conference, at which time the Secretary or the deputies of the Secretary may informally discuss the proposed issue and the timing of the
                        steps taken in issuing the special obligation bonds or notes.

                        of a corporate trustee. Bonds and notes may also be issued under an order or resolution without a corporate trustee. The corporate trustee may be, in either case any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within

                        the rights and remedies of the owners of any bonds or notes issued thereunder as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the unit in respect of the purposes to which

                        be subordinated and junior in standing, with respect to the payment of principal and interest and to the security thereof, to any other bonds or notes. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company that may act as depository
                        of the proceeds of bonds or notes, revenues, or any other money hereunder to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the unit. Any trust agreement or resolution may set out the rights
                        and remedies of the owners of any bonds or notes and of any trustee, and may restrict the individual rights of action by the owners. In addition to the foregoing, any trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions
                        as the unit may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the owners of any bonds or notes. Expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of any trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of any
                        project or as an administrative charge and may be paid from the revenues or from any other funds available.

                    In determining whether a proposed bond or note issue should be approved, the Local Government Commission may consider, to the extent applicable as shall be determined by the Local Government Commission, the criteria set forth in

                    the effect of the proposed financing upon any scheduled or proposed sale of obligations by the State or by any of its agencies or departments or by any unit of local government in the State. The Local Government Commission shall approve
                    the issuance of the bonds or notes if, upon the information and evidence it receives, it finds and determines that the proposed financing will satisfy such criteria and will effect the purposes of this section. An approval of an issue
                    shall not be regarded as an approval of the legality of the issue in any respect. A decision by the Local Government Commission denying an application is final.

                    such price or prices as the Local Government Commission shall determine to be in the best interests of the unit and to effect the purposes of this section, if the sale is approved by the unit.

                    of the bonds or notes to set the terms and conditions of the bonds or notes and to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the bondholders or noteholders. The State shall in no way impair the rights and remedies of the bondholders
                    or noteholders until the bonds or notes and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceedings by or on behalf of the bondholders or noteholders, are fully paid, met, and discharged.

                <p>
                    A unit of local government may not enter into any contract subject to this Article unless it is approved by the Local Government Commission as evidenced by the secretary's certificate thereon. Any contract subject to this Article that does not bear the
                    secretary's certificate thereon shall be void, and it shall be unlawful for any officer, employee, or agent of a unit of local government to make any payments of money thereunder. Before executing a contract subject to this Article,
                    the governing board of the contracting unit shall file an application for Commission approval of the contract with the secretary of the Commission. The application shall state such facts and have attached to it such documents concerning
                    the proposed contract and the financial condition of the contracting unit as the secretary may require. The Commission may prescribe the form of the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before he accepts the application, the secretary may require the governing board or its representatives to attend a preliminary conference at which time the secretary and his deputies may informally discuss the proposed contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After an application in proper form and order has been filed, and after a preliminary conference if one is required, the secretary shall notify the unit in writing that the application has been filed and accepted for submission to the Commission. The
                    secretary's statement shall be conclusive evidence that the unit has complied with this section.

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - An amendment to this section by Session Laws 1993, c. 497, s. 12, was made effective upon certification of approval of an amendment to Article V of the Constitution of North Carolina relating to the authority of any county,
                    city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects. This amendment was submitted to the people on
                    November 2, 1993 and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, never took effect.

                    An earlier amendment to this section in Session Laws 1981 (Reg. Sess., 1982), c. 1276, s. 9, was made effective on certification of approval of a State constitutional amendment authorizing the enactment of laws dealing with transactions of the type contemplated
                    by the act. Such an amendment was proposed by Session Laws 1981 (Reg. Sess., 1982), c. 1247, was submitted to the people on Nov. 2, 1982, and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, did not go into effect.

                    If a unit of local government or municipality (as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t159sIVa04s159-44" target="_self">G.S. 159-44</a></cite>, 159-81, or 159-102) fails to pay any installment of principal or interest on its outstanding
                    debt on or before the due date (whether the debt is evidenced by general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, project development financing debt instruments, bond anticipation notes, tax anticipation notes, or revenue anticipation notes)
                    and remains in default for 90 days, the Commission may take such action as it deems advisable to investigate the unit's or municipality's fiscal affairs, consult with its governing board, and negotiate with its creditors in order to
                    assist the unit or municipality in working out a plan for refinancing, adjusting, or compromising the debt. When a plan is developed that the Commission finds to be fair and equitable and reasonably within the ability of the unit or
                    municipality to meet, the Commission shall enter an order finding that it is fair, equitable, and within the ability of the unit or municipality to meet. The Commission shall then advise the governing board to take the necessary steps
                    to implement it. If the governing board declines or refuses to do so within 90 days after receiving the Commission's advice, the Commission may enter an order directing the governing board to implement the plan. When this order is
                    entered, the members of the governing board and all officers and employees of the unit or municipality shall be under an affirmative duty to do all things necessary to implement the plan. The Commission may apply to the appropriate
                    division of the General Court of Justice for a court order to the governing board and other officers and employees of the unit or municipality to enforce the Commission's order.

                        three criteria: (i) the enterprise system experienced negative working capital; (ii) the enterprise system experienced a quick ratio of less than 1.0; or (iii) the unit or public authority experienced a net loss of revenue from

                        and warning from the Commission. The notice and warning may occur prior to the expiration of the three-year period. When the Commission takes action under this section, the Commission is vested with the powers of the governing

                        Foundation of Public Officers' Liability. - The foundation of liability of public officers can be expressed as follows: However honest the defendants may be, the public has a right to be protected against the wrongful conduct of their servants, if there
                        is carelessness amounting to a willful want of care in the discharge of their official duties, which injures the public. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert.
                        denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The elements of approving a false claim in violation of this section are (1) that defendant was a finance officer, other officer or employee of local government, (2) that in such capacity she approved a claim or bill, and (3) that at the time she approved
                        the claim or bill she knew it was fraudulent, erroneous or otherwise invalid. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>,

                    <p>
                        The elements of making a false report in violation of this section are (1) that defendant was a finance officer, other officer or employee of local government, (2) that the written statement was required by rules and regulations established by the local
                        government for the lawful disbursement of funds, and (3) that defendant made a written statement on a voucher knowing that a portion of it was false. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite>                        526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).

                    <p>
                        The State was not required to elect between offenses of approving a false claim in violation of this section and making a false report, since the elements of the two charges were not the same. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite>                        526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).

                    <p>
                        Corrupt Intent Need Not Be Proved. - In order for the State to prove official misconduct proscribed by this section, it is not necessary for the State to prove a corrupt intent or willful design to cheat and defraud the public. Every public officer is
                        bound to perform the duties of his office faithfully, to use reasonable skill and diligence, and to act primarily for the benefit of the public. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite>                        526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).

                        <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).

                    If an officer or employee of a local government or public authority persists, after notice and warning from the Commission, in failing or refusing to comply with any provision of this Chapter, he forfeits his office or employment. The Commission may enter
                    an order suspending the offender from further performance of his office or employment after first giving him notice and an opportunity to be heard in his own defense, pending the outcome of quo warranto proceedings. Upon suspending
                    a local officer or employee under this section, the Commission shall report the circumstances to the Attorney General who shall initiate quo warranto proceedings against the officer or employee in the General Court of Justice. If an

                    and financial services sectors, to review and propose changes to the General Statutes dealing with public finance in an effort to strengthen, modernize, and provide for the most efficient method of issuing of public debt by local governments

                    The duty of a governmental unit to make the payments required and to perform the other duties of the governmental unit under a swap agreement shall constitute a continuing contractual obligation of the governmental unit, enforceable in accordance with
                    applicable law for the enforcement of contractual obligations of that governmental unit. A governmental unit may limit its duties under a swap agreement to designated property or a designated source of revenues or receipts of the governmental
                    unit, such as the revenues of a specified utility or other public service enterprise system of the governmental unit. If a governmental unit enters into a swap agreement in connection with obligations that are secured by a designated
                    form of security, then, subject to the terms of the bond order or resolution, trust indenture or trust agreement, installment contract or lease purchase agreement, or similar instrument pursuant to which the obligations are issued
                    or incurred, the governmental unit may pledge, mortgage, or grant a security interest in the revenues of the utility or other public service enterprise system, program, receipts, property, or similar arrangement securing the obligations
                    to secure the payment and performance of its duties under the swap agreement. Any pledge of assets, revenues, or receipts to secure the duties of a governmental unit under a swap agreement shall become effective in the same manner

                    Whenever an airport authority is authorized by general or local act to erect and construct improvements and facilities and to lease these improvements and facilities, the authority may borrow money for use in making and paying for these improvements and
                    facilities, secured by and on the credit only of the lease agreements in respect to these improvements and facilities, and to pledge and assign the leases and lease agreements as security for the authorized loans. The airport authority's
                    power to borrow money under this section is subject to the approval of the Commission. To the extent this section conflicts with any local act, then this section shall control.
