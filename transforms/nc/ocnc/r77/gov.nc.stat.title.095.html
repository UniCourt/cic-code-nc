                        The General Assembly in enacting the Wage and Hour Act expressly recognized that the general welfare of the people necessitated a balancing of the employee's right to earn acceptable wages and the competitive position of North Carolina business and industry.
                        The statutory remedy making the employer potentially liable for up to twice the amount due plus the costs and expenses incurred by the employee in pursuing the claim reflects this balancing. Amos v. Oakdale Knitting Co.,

                        This Article requires an employer to notify an employee in advance of the wages and hours which he will earn and the conditions which must be met to earn them, and to pay such wages and benefits as are due when the employee has actually performed the
                        work required to earn them. Once the employee has earned wages and benefits under this statutory scheme, the employer is prevented from rescinding them, with the exception that for certain benefits such as commissions, bonuses
                        and vacation pay, an employer may cause a loss or forfeiture of such pay if he has notified the employee of the conditions for loss or forfeiture in advance of the time when the pay is earned. Narron v. Hardee's Food Sys.,

                        arriving early to wait to be assigned a job, which would improve a worker's chances of employment, was completely optional and that waiting time and travel time was not compensable work time. Whitehead v. Sparrow Enter.,

                        Former employee presented more than a scintilla of evidence in support of his position that he earned the $675,000 in issuance bonuses under the employer's bonus policy and the conflicting evidence offered by the parties was enough, on its own, to allow

                        Former employee's formula to calculate the bonus due to him was adequate to submit to the jury the question of whether the issuance bonuses owed were calculable under the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a2As95-25.2" target="_self">G.S. 95-25.2</a></cite>,
                        as the formula offered was at least one reasonable way to calculate those bonuses, and the evidence relied on for that formula was supported in the record. Morris v.

                        Liquidated Damages Properly Awarded. - Based upon the plain language of the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act (NCWHA), the unpaid amounts due under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a2As95-25.7" target="_self">G.S. 95-25.7</a></cite>                        were a doctor's wages as defined by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a2As95-25.2" target="_self">G.S. 95-25.2(16)</a></cite>. Consequently, the fact that the employer could withhold or divert a portion of the doctor's wages in accordance
                        with state and federal law did not change the fact that they were unpaid amounts which the employer should have paid out, either directly to the employee or for the employee's benefit, but for the violation of the NCWHA. Harper

                        This Article requires an employer to notify an employee in advance of the wages and hours which he will earn and the conditions which must be met to earn them, and to pay such wages and benefits as are due when the employee has actually performed the
                        work required to earn them. Once the employee has earned the wages and benefits under this statutory scheme, the employer is prevented from rescinding them, with the exception that for certain benefits such as commissions, bonuses
                        and vacation pay, an employer may cause a loss or forfeiture of such pay if he has notified the employee of the conditions for loss or forfeiture in advance of the time when the pay is earned. Narron v. Hardee's Food Systems,

                        The vacation pay due an employee at the termination of his employment is not controlled solely by the employer's vacation policy in effect at the time of termination. If the employee earned and accumulated vacation under a vacation policy which did not
                        provide for forfeiture of unused vacation, this Article would dictate that he receive all vacation pay earned prior to the employer's change of personnel policy with regard thereto. Narron v. Hardee's Food Sys.,

                        A claim for vacation pay pursuant to this Article is not preempted by federal law, the United States Supreme Court having recently held that an employer's policy of paying discharged employees vacation pay for unused vacation time does not constitute
                        an "employee welfare benefit plan" within the meaning of the Employment Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, 29 U.S.C.

        Change to Wages Without Notification.
       </b> - In this breach of contract and North Carolina Wage and Hour Act action, defendant was denied summary judgment because there was no evidence that defendant provided any written or posted notice to plaintiff about a
                        change to his promised wages; it appeared that defendant simply stopped paying the "guaranteed compensation" of $11,000.00 per month to plaintiff starting in or about January 2009. Ken E. Church &amp; Ken E. Church Enters., LLC

                        Forfeiture of Bonus upon Termination of Employment. - Where plaintiff's employment was terminated before the end of the plan year and defendant refused to pay any bonus, although there was no notification to plaintiff that termination of his employment
                        could result in forfeiture of his bonus, the decision to require forfeiture of the bonus did not constitute a change in the plan; therefore, no notice was required. McCullough v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co.,

                        Amendment of Annual Bonus That Had Not Yet Accrued. - Employee's North Carolina Wage and Hour Act claim was denied because the employee's annual bonus had not accrued at the time of a change in the employer's allocation plan and, thus, there was no violation
                        of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a2As95-25.13" target="_self">G.S. 95-25.13(3)</a></cite>, because, under the employee's contract, the amount to which any member of the division of her employer in which
                        she worked was entitled to as a bonus was not calculable until the end of the plan year; thus, no definite sum had accrued to the employee at the time the change was made. Moses H. Cone Mem'l Health Servs. Corp. v. Triplett,

                        the employers' representative orally agreed to pay the employee an annual bonus as part of a contract; (2) the employers modified the employee's bonus formula without his consent; and (3) the employers also failed to give the employee

                        Sufficient Evidence to Support Liquidated Damages Award for Failure to Give Notice. - Employer's failure to provide a former employee with notice of the change in his bonus plan constituted sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that
                        the employer did not act in good faith or with objective reasonableness and, therefore, justified the business court's award of liquidated damages in the case. Morris v.

                        Several factors used by federal jurisdictions to determine employee status under the FLSA are equally useful in the context of the Wage and Hour Act: (1) whether the alleged employee performs services for the employer; (2) the degree of control exerted
                        by the alleged employer over the individual or entity; and (3) the alleged employee's opportunity for profit or loss derived from its relationship with the employer. Laborers' Int'l Union v. Case Farms, Inc.,

                        Accrual of Cause of Action. - As defendant's policy did not require it to pay cash for any unused vacation days until the employment was terminated, no individual plaintiff had a cause of action until the next pay day after termination; thus the trial
                        court correctly found that only those plaintiffs whose pay date next following termination preceded two years prior to the filing of the action were barred by this section. Hamilton v. Memorex Telex Corp.,

                    <p>
                        Class Action not Appropriate. - Wage and Hour Act claims would require individual determinations, including which putative class members were subject to the alleged violations and why those putative class members who worked off-the-clock did so, i.e.,
                        whether they, for example, missed breaks in order to leave work early; thus, it was not a proper claim for a class action suit. Harrison v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite>                        545, 613 S.E.2d 322 (2005).

                        No Recovery of Attorneys' Fees from City. - In view of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a2As95-25.14" target="_self">G.S. 95-25.14</a></cite>, which explicitly exempts this State and any city, town or municipality from the application
                        of Article 2A of this Chapter, subsection (d) of this section, relating to the recovery of attorneys' fees, had no application to plaintiff who sought to compel city to pay him for stand-by duty worked for the city police department,
                        and the trial court was in error in awarding such fees. Newber v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 350 S.E.2d 125 (1986), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 225</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Because the Act does not require a finding that defendants acted in bad faith in order for attorney's fees to be awarded to plaintiff, the court acted within its discretion by awarding the plaintiff/piano salesman attorney's fees. Fulk v. Piedmont Music

                        Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs Appropriate to Employee. - Former employer failed to show that a trial court abused the court's discretion when, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a2As95-25.22ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 95-25.22(d)</a></cite>,
                        the court awarded attorney's fees and costs to a former employee on the employee's claim for unpaid wages because the employer failed to show that the trial court, in making the court's findings did not: (1) hear all of the attorneys'
                        arguments; (2) observe their litigation strategies; (3) watch their examination of witnesses; (4) rule on their evidentiary objections; (5) read their briefs; (6) listen to their summations of the evidence; and (7) consider their

                        Attorney's Fee Award Required Further Findings of Fact. - Appellate court reversed the business court's award of attorneys' fees in an employment retaliation case and remanded the case for further findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding whether
                        the former employee's claims arose from a common nucleus of operative fact and, thus, whether he was entitled to all of his attorneys' fees because it should not have allocated the attorneys' fees among the claims on which he was
                        successful and those on which he was not. Morris v. Scenera Research, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 31, 747 S.E.2d 362 (2013).

                        Action Not Frivolous. - A former employee's action for unpaid wages and attorney fees was not frivolous, and thus, the employer was not entitled to attorney fees, even though employer prevailed in the action, where the employer's motions for summary judgment
                        and directed verdict were rejected, and all claims were submitted to the jury. Rice v. Danas, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 736, 514 S.E.2d 97 (1999).

                        Liquidated Damages Denied. - Employer that was required to reimburse temporary foreign workers' transportation and border crossing expenses to the extent those expenses reduced the workers' first week's wages below the minimum wage was not liable for
                        liquidated damages under 29 U.S.C.S.

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding an employee liquidated damages under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a2As95-25.22" target="_self">G.S. 95-25.22</a></cite>, when the employers unilaterally modified the employee's
                        agreed to bonus formula without notice, because the employers neither offered evidence showing nor argued how the trial court's decision to award liquidated damages was so arbitrary that it could not have been the result of a reasoned
                        decision. Further, review of the record did not indicate the trial court's decision to impose liquidated damages on the employers was manifestly unsupported by reason. Arndt v. First Union Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite>                        518, 613 S.E.2d 274 (2005).

                        Liquidated damages award was properly awarded to the doctor where the amount awarded was equal the amount left unpaid by the employer's North Carolina Wage and Hour Act violation. Harper v. Vohra Wound Physicians of NY, - N.C. App. - , 841 S.E.2d 580
                        (2020).

                    <p>
                        Based upon the plain language of the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act (NCWHA), the unpaid amounts due under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a2As95-25.7" target="_self">G.S. 95-25.7</a></cite> were a doctor's wages as defined by
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a2As95-25.2" target="_self">G.S. 95-25.2(16)</a></cite>. Consequently, the fact that the employer could withhold or divert a portion of the doctor's wages in accordance with state and federal law
                        did not change the fact that they were unpaid amounts which the employer should have paid out, either directly to the employee or for the employee's benefit, but for the violation of the NCWHA. Harper v. Vohra Wound Physicians
                        of NY, - N.C. App. - , 841 S.E.2d 580 (2020).

                        Sufficient Evidence to Support Liquidated Damages Award. - Employer's failure to provide a former employee with notice of the change in his bonus plan constituted sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that the employer did not act in
                        good faith or with objective reasonableness and, therefore, justified the business court's award of liquidated damages in the case. Morris v. Scenera Research, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite>                        31, 747 S.E.2d 362 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Section Is Constitutional. - The provisions of this section, rendering an assignment invalid unless accepted in writing by the employer, do not deprive the assignee of due process of law or the equal protection of the laws. Morris v. Holshouser,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">220 N.C. 293</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 115, 137 A.L.R. 733 (1941).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When applied to contracts executed after its effective date, this section cannot be held unconstitutional as impairing the obligations of contracts. Morris v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 293</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 115,
                        137 A.L.R. 733 (1941).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section is a regulation of contracts growing out of the relationship of employer and employee imposed for the general welfare and is a valid exercise of the police power of the State. Morris v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 293</cite>,
                        17 S.E.2d 115, 137 A.L.R. 733 (1941).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that this section permits an employer, at his election, to accept an assignment of unearned wages executed by his employee does not in itself constitute an unconstitutional discrimination, since in the absence of legislative restraint, one engaged
                        in private business may exercise his own pleasure as to the parties with whom he will deal. Morris v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 293</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 115, 137 A.L.R. 733 (1941).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Purpose. - The end in view was not only to relieve the employer of unnecessary responsibility, but also to restrain the activities of those who were engaged in the business of buying at a discount the unearned wages of employees. Morris v. Holshouser,
                        <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 293</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 115, 137 A.L.R. 733 (1941).

                    <p>
                        Section Applies Only to Wages to Be Earned. - An assignment by an employee of wages earned and due him from the employer is valid without acceptance by the employer, and the assignee may sue the employer thereon, the provision of this section being applicable
                        only to wages to be earned in the future. Rickman v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 377</cite>, 8 S.E.2d 199 (1940).

                    It is hereby declared as the public policy of this State that the best interests of the people of the State are served by the prevention or prompt settlement of labor disputes; that strikes and lockouts and other forms of industrial strife, regardless

                        Picketing for the purpose of forcing an employer to employ only union labor is for an unlawful purpose by virtue of this section. Douglas Aircraft Co. v. Local 379, Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 620</cite>,

                        Federal Preemption. - Where orderly and peaceful picketing is for the unlawful purpose of forcing an employer to breach the Right-to-Work Law embraced in this section by employing only union labor, and also constitutes an unfair labor practice within
                        the purview of the Federal Labor Management Relations Act, the North Carolina courts have no authority to issue a restraining order enjoining such picketing, since under the federal decisions the federal law exclusively preempts
                        the field and removes the matter from the jurisdiction of the State courts. Douglas Aircraft Co. v. Local 379, Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 620</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 800 (1958).

                        Employer's Right to Discharge Supervisor for Union Membership Is Federal. - Congress and the federal courts have adopted a national industrial relations policy which gives an employer the right to discharge his supervisor for union membership. Beasley

                        When plaintiff seeks to deprive an employer of his right to discharge his supervisor for membership in a union, the doctrine of federal preemption applies, and the state court is without jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy. Beasley

                    <p>
                        Employer's Right to Discharge Supervisor for Union Membership Is Federal. - Congress and the federal courts have adopted a national industrial relations policy which gives an employer the right to discharge his supervisor for union membership. Beasley
                        v. Food Fair of N.C. Inc., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 530</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 911 (1973), aff'd, 416 U.S. 653, 94 S. Ct. 2023, 40 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1974).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        State is precluded from interfering with that policy. Beasley v. Food Fair of N.C. Inc., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 530</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 911 (1973), aff'd, 416 U.S. 653, 94 S. Ct. 2023, 40 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1974).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When plaintiffs seek to deprive an employer of his right to discharge his supervisor for membership in a union, the doctrine of federal preemption applies, and the state court is without jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy. Beasley
                        v. Food Fair of N.C. Inc., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 530</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 911 (1973), aff'd, 416 U.S. 653, 94 S. Ct. 2023, 40 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1974).

                    <p>
                        What Plaintiff Must Show. - In order for the plaintiff in the instant case to recover for damages allegedly sustained as a result of his discharge in violation of the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a10s95-81" target="_self">G.S. 95-81</a></cite>,
                        the burden is on him to show by competent evidence, and by the greater weight thereof, that he was discharged solely by reason of his participation in the discussions with his fellow employees in connection with their proposed
                        plan to join a labor union or that such participation therein was the "motivating" or "moving cause" for the discharge. Willard v. Huffman, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 523</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 373 (1958).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        What Jury Must Find. - Where there is a conflict in the evidence as to the reason for discharge, in an action brought under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a10s95-81" target="_self">G.S. 95-81</a></cite> and the
                        following sections, in order for a plaintiff to recover damages thereunder, the jury must find that the discharge resulted solely from the plaintiff 's exercise of rights protected under this statute, or that the plaintiff 's exercise
                        of such rights was the motivating or moving cause for such discharge. Willard v. Huffman, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 523</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 373 (1958).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction over Violation. - Where the National Labor Relations Board has declined jurisdiction because the amount of interstate commerce involved is less than the jurisdictional amount fixed by the Board, a State court has jurisdiction of an action
                        for damages brought for an alleged violation of this section. Willard v. Huffman, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 396</cite>, 109 S.E.2d 233, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 893, 80 S. Ct. 195, 4 L. Ed. 2d 150 (1959).

                    If, after investigation, the Commissioner finds that a violation of any of his rules and regulations exists, or that there is a condition in passenger tramway construction, operation, or maintenance which endangers the safety of the public, the Commissioner
                    shall forthwith issue his written order setting forth his findings, the corrective action to be taken, and fixing a reasonable time for compliance therewith. The order shall be sent to the affected operator by certified mail with return
                    receipt, by signature confirmation as provided by the U.S. Postal Service, by a designated delivery service authorized pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7502(f)(2) with delivery receipt, or via hand delivery, and shall become final unless the
                    operator contests the order by filing a petition for a contested case under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba03s150B-23" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-23</a></cite> within 20 days after
                    receiving the order.

                        Purpose. - The primary purpose of this Act is to keep conditions in the workplace safe for workers. This purpose cannot possibly be accomplished where employers are allowed to delegate to a third party a specific duty promulgated under the Act that is
                        designed to protect the safety of workers. Therefore, where an employer, on a regular basis, is not aware of the reputation of the electrician who grounds equipment emitting dangerous currents of electricity, such blatant disregard
                        for the safety of employees cannot be ignored. Brooks v. BCF Piping, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 426 S.E.2d 282 (1993).

                        There is statutory authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a16s95-126ol1b2m" target="_self">G.S. 95-126(b)(2)(m)</a></cite> granted to the North Carolina Department of Labor to protect the health and safety of all employees
                        in North Carolina; the operations manual is a non-binding interpretive statement, not a rule requiring formal rule-making procedures - accordingly, the exception that requires rule-making if the rights and duties of the employer
                        are affected does not apply; thus, the operations manual merely established guidelines that directed Occupational Safety and Health Act inspectors as to what parties could be cited for violation of a rule and thus did not require
                        formal rule-making. Comm'r of Labor v. Weekley Homes, L.P., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 17, 609 S.E.2d 407 (2005).

                        Where an employee alleged that he was wrongfully discharged in violation of public policy, his cause of action under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of North Carolina, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a16s95-126" target="_self">G.S. 95-126</a></cite>                        et seq., was not dismissed for failure to state claim because the Act was a source of public policy as set out in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a16s95-126ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 95-126(b)(2)</a></cite>; though it could not
                        be gleaned whether the employee's complaints were shared with an external source pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a16s95-130" target="_self">G.S. 95-130(7)</a></cite>, the issue could easily be addressed on summary judgment.

                        Retaliatory Employment Discrimination Act Claim Not Stated. - Retaliatory Employment Discrimination Act claim failed to state a claim where plaintiff did not initiate an inquiry under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a21s95-241ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 95-241(a)</a></cite>                        when he submitted a proposed plan that would have provided certification of the crane operators in compliance with an upcoming regulatory change and complained about his concerns regarding the certification of riggers; plaintiff's
                        call to defendant one's ethics hotline was to report the retaliatory treatment he was receiving, not to report a concern about occupational health and safety in the context of his employment under the Occupational Safety and Health
                        Act of North Carolina, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a16s95-126" target="_self">G.S. 95-126</a></cite> et seq. Pierce v. Atl. Group, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 724 S.E.2d 568 (2012).

                        Serious Violation. - The evidence supported a determination by the Safety and Health Review Board [now the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission] that respondent was guilty of a serious and repeated Occupational Safety and Health Act violation
                        in failing to slope to adequate angle of repose or provide adequate shoring for sewer line trench in hard or compact soil more than five feet in depth at job site on April 21, 1977, where it showed that the trench in question was
                        eight feet deep and at least eight feet in length; there was no sloping or shoring or wall support of any kind; and respondent had paid a fine for failing properly to shore, slope or otherwise protect the sides of a trench in 1974,
                        although the 1974 violation was for work in soft or unstable soil rather than in hard or compact soil. Brooks v. McWhirter Grading Co., <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 352, 271 S.E.2d 568 (1980),

                        Evidence that petitioner's employee would walk along 10-inch-wide steel beams at a height of 40 to 60 feet above the ground and would perform work tasks while balanced on those beams, at no time being secured by a safety rope, presented the possibility
                        of an accident which would carry a substantial probability of death or serious injury, and thus showed a "serious violation" within the meaning of subdivision (18). Moreover, substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the
                        violation was "willful," that is, that it was a deliberate disregard of a duty, imposed by statute, regulation or contract, necessary to the safety of a person or property. O.S. Steel Erectors v. Brooks,

                        Nondelegable Duties. - The primary purpose of this Act is to keep conditions in the workplace safe for workers. This purpose cannot possibly be accomplished where employers are allowed to delegate to a third party a specific duty promulgated under the
                        Act that is designed to protect the safety of workers. Brooks v. BCF Piping, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 426 S.E.2d 282 (1993).

                        Company was hired by another to provide welding services and delivered welding equipment, which it had inspected, to plant. The equipment that was improperly wired was owned by welding company, placed on the worksite by welding company employees and was
                        to be used by welding company's employees. Although it was proper and customary to send the male end plug and allow someone else to attach it, welding company's reliance on the plant's electrician to properly ground machinery and
                        protect its employees from the existence of a hazard was unreasonable pursuant to the North Carolina Occupational Safety and Health Act which imposed a specific duty on welding company to inspect the arc welder to make sure it
                        was properly grounded; such a statutory duty was nondelegable. Brooks v. BCF Piping, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 426 S.E.2d 282 (1993).

                        Member of an LLC did not undertake an independent duty to ensure worker safety at a plant where the employer was the LLC, who had a nondelegable duty under North Carolina law to provide a worker with a safe workplace, and the member had not undertaken
                        any affirmative duty to provide a safe workplace for the LLC's employees in entering an operating agreement for the plant with other members of the LLC. Spaulding v.

                        When Hazard Recognized. - A hazard is recognized only when the Commissioner of Labor demonstrates that feasible measures can be taken to reduce materially the likelihood of death or serious physical harm resulting to employees. Brooks v. Rebarco, Inc.,

                        Standard for Determining Existence of Hazard. - Whether or not a hazard exists is to be determined by the standard of a reasonably prudent person. Industry custom and practice are relevant and helpful but are not dispositive. If a reasonable and prudent
                        person would recognize a hazard, the industry cannot eliminate it by closing its eyes. Brooks v. Rebarco, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 372 S.E.2d 342 (1988).

                        Showing Prerequisite to Suit Under "General Duty Clause" of Subdivision (1). - To successfully prosecute a violation under subdivision (1), known as the "general duty clause," a complainant must show that an employer failed to render its workplace free
                        of a hazard which was "recognized" and causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm. Brooks v. Rebarco, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 372 S.E.2d 342 (1988).

                        Burden of Proof. - Where commissioner had issued a citation to elevator company for violating the general duty clause, commissioner had the burden of proving: (1) the employer failed to render its workplace free of a hazard; (2) the hazard was recognized;
                        (3) the hazard was causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm; and (4) there were feasible means by which the employer could have eliminated or materially reduced the hazard. Brooks v. Dover Elevator Co.,

                        committed by its own employees and also those committed by its subcontractors; thus, the citation issued by the State Department of Labor for failing to conduct frequent and regular inspections of the job sites was appropriate.

                        The rule as to employer culpability for safety violations in cases involving multi-employer work sites is that an employer is expected to make reasonable efforts to detect and abate any violation of safety standards of which it is aware and to which its
                        employees are exposed, despite the fact that the employer did not commit the violation. Brooks v. Rebarco, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 372 S.E.2d 342 (1988).

                        to employees of subcontractors on job sites; however, the duty is a reasonable duty and the general contractor is only liable for violations that its subcontractor may create if it could reasonably have been expected to detect
                        the violation by inspecting the job site. Comm'r of Labor v. Weekley Homes, L.P., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 17, 609 S.E.2d 407 (2005).

                        Grievances. - Where an employee alleged that he was wrongfully discharged in violation of public policy, his cause of action under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of North Carolina, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a16s95-126" target="_self">G.S. 95-126</a></cite>                        et seq., was not dismissed for failure to state claim because the Act was a source of public policy as set out in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a16s95-126ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 95-126(b)(2)</a></cite>; though it could not
                        be gleaned whether the employee's complaints were shared with an external source pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a16s95-130" target="_self">G.S. 95-130(7)</a></cite>, the issue could easily be addressed on summary judgment.

                        Discharge Not Linked to Protected Activities. - Although employee's complaint to his employer and employee's filing of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of North Carolina (OSHANC) claim were protected activities, employer met its burden of proof
                        of showing that employee would have been discharged in the absence of his protected activity; the following factors supported this conclusion: (i) employee disregarded company safety policy thereby creating two potentially life-threatening
                        situations, (ii) the absence of any evidence of insidious intent on the part of the first-shift employees who reported the incidents, (iii) the lack of any connection whatever between these employees' reporting the incidents and
                        Nettles' OSHANC complaint eight months earlier, and (iv) the time lapse between the OSHANC complaint and the incidents precipitating employee's termination. Brooks v.

                        sought, namely back pay for the period during employee's suspension, made this action one for private rather than public benefits. Brooks v. Stroh Brewery Co., <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 226,

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) With regard to employer-provided rescue procedures, employers must ensure that at least two trained and designated rescue employees are on-site when employees are working at heights over six feet on the tower, except that where only two employees
                    are on-site, then an employer may comply with this requirement if one employee is a trained and designated rescue employee and one employee has been employed for less than nine months and has received documented orientation from the
                    employer outlining steps to take in an emergency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) With regard to third-party-provided rescue procedures, the employer must obtain verification from the third-party rescue service that the service is able to respond to a rescue summons in a timely manner and that the service is proficient in rescue-related
                    tasks and equipment needed to rescue climbers from elevated heights on communication structures. The employer must also provide the selected third-party rescue service with contact information regarding the tower site and allow the
                    service to conduct whatever preparation for rescue it deems necessary.

                        But Violation of OSHA Rules Is Not Negligence Per Se. - Since a willful violation of an Occupational Safety and Health Act rule constitutes a misdemeanor only if said violation causes the death of an employee, and for all other violations, the sanction
                        is a possible civil penalty assessed by the Commissioner, the adopted OSHA regulations are not penal in nature, and, therefore, a violation does not constitute negligence per se. Cowan v. Laughridge Constr. Co.,

                        Industry Practice Is Only One Factor in Determining Reasonableness. - Each industry is permitted to evaluate the hazards associated with its own operations and determine what, if anything, to do about them. But the practice in the industry is but one

                        Board Complied with Authority. - In an appeal from a decision of a hearing examiner that respondent's violation of the Occupational Safety and Health Act was not repeated and serious and merited no penalty, the Safety and Health Review Board [now the
                        Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission] complied with its function and authority to adopt, modify or vacate the order of the hearing examiner where the board's order restated the findings of fact made by the hearing examiner
                        almost verbatim, narrated some of the evidence, and made additional findings, and where the decision portion of the order modified the order of the hearing examiner so as to conclude that the cited violation was repeated and serious
                        and justified a penalty of $2,500. Brooks v. McWhirter Grading Co., <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 352, 271 S.E.2d 568 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 573</cite>,

                        Probable cause for an administration inspection warrant may be based on (1) specific evidence of an existing violation, or (2) a showing that reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are satisfied with respect to
                        a particular establishment. In order to meet the requirements of the second standard, an applicant for an inspection warrant must show that: (1) there exists a legally authorized inspection program which naturally included the
                        property; (2) the general administrative enforcement plan is based on reasonable legislative or administrative standards; and (3) the administrative standards are being applied to the particular establishment on a neutral basis.

                        When Act Is Willful. - An act is willful when there exists a deliberate purpose not to discharge some duty necessary to the safety of the person or property of another or some duty assumed by contract or imposed by law. Prevette v. Clark Equip. Co.,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 302 S.E.2d 639 (1983).

                    <p>
                        What Constitutes "Repeated" Violation. - In order for a violation to be repeated, it must be against the same employer and it must also be substantially similar to prior violations. Brooks v. McWhirter Grading Co., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 573</cite>,
                        281 S.E.2d 24 (1981).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A subsequent OSHA violation by the same employer substantially similar to a prior violation or violations is a "repeated" violation only if the employer should have known of the standard by virtue of the prior citation or citations. Factors which should
                        be considered in determining whether the employer should have known of the standard are the extent to which the condition was obviously unsafe, the proximity in time to the prior citation, whether management or key employees had
                        changed between citations, and the number of prior substantially similar violations. Brooks v. McWhirter Grading Co., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 573</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 24 (1981).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where two alleged OSHA violations are of different subsections of the same standard and involve the same hazard, the second violation can form the basis of the citation for a "repeated" violation. Brooks v. McWhirter Grading Co.,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">303 N.C. 573</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 24 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Burden of Showing "Serious" Violation. - In order to establish a serious OSHA violation under this section, the Commissioner of Labor must show by substantial evidence that the violation created a possibility of an accident, a substantially probable result
                        of which was death or serious physical injury. Brooks v. McWhirter Grading Co., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 573</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 24 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Violation of OSHA Rule Not Negligence Per Se. - Since a willful violation of an Occupational Safety and Health Act rule constitutes a misdemeanor only if said violation causes the death of an employee, and for all other violations, the sanction is a possible
                        civil penalty assessed by the Commissioner, the adopted OSHA regulations are not penal in nature, and, therefore, a violation does not constitute negligence per se. Cowan v. Laughridge Constr. Co.,

                            class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 321, 291 S.E.2d 287 (1982).

                        Fine of $1800 for a "willful-serious" violation in allowing an employee to work on steel beams 30 feet off the ground without safety nets or a safety belt was well within the established guidelines for a violation of this nature. O.S. Steel Erectors v.

                    Editor's Note. - Session Laws 2011-401, s. 3.7, stated in its prefatory language that "G.S. 94-144(b) reads as rewritten." There is no section G.S. 94-144, and it appears that the amendment was intended for <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a16s95-144ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 95-144(b)</a></cite>.
                    The amendment would have substituted "Department of Commerce, Division of Employment Security (DES)" for "Employment Security Commission," "DES" for "Employment Security Commission of this State" and for "Employment Security Commission,"
                    and "Division" for "Commissioner". The amendment has not been implemented at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Session Laws 2011-401, s. 5.1, provides: "Deletion of references. - The Revisor of Statutes may delete any reference in the General Statutes to the Employment Security Commission, or any derivative thereof, and substitute references to the Division
                    of Employment Security (DES) of the Department of Commerce created by this act wherever conforming changes are necessary. The Revisor of Statutes may delete any reference in the General Statutes to the Chairman of the Employment Security
                    Commission, or any derivative thereof, and substitute references to the Secretary of Commerce as appropriate." Pursuant to that authority, the Revisor of Statutes has made conforming changes in subsection (b), which has been set out

                    It is the intent of the General Assembly to prescribe this uniform system for the disclosure of information regarding the use or storage of hazardous chemicals. To that end, all units of local government in the State are preempted from exercising their
                    powers to require disclosure, directly or indirectly, of information regarding the use or storage of hazardous chemicals by employers to any members of the public, or to any branch or agent of State or local government in any manner
                    other than as provided for in this Article. This section does not preempt the enforcement of the provisions of any nationally recognized fire code that may be adopted by a unit of local government.

                        the migrant workers' liberty and the statutory and regulatory commands did not hinder efforts by private farmers to provide safe housing for their workers. Edwards v. Johnston County Health Dep't, 885 F.2d 1215 (4th Cir. 1989),

                    If the Department of Labor of North Carolina determines that housing provided to migrants under this Article is uninhabitable, but is not reasonably expected to cause death or serious physical harm, the migrants shall be allowed to remain in the housing

                    be levied against the operator during the 14-day period after the housing has been determined to be uninhabitable in which the migrants are allowed to remain in the housing. The alternative housing shall be provided at the same rate
                    or less than the rate paid by the migrants for the uninhabitable housing. If the Director determines, after recommendation by an inspector, that housing provided to migrants could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical

                    The General Assembly finds that individuals should be protected from unreliable and inadequate examinations and screening for controlled substances. The General Assembly also finds that employers who test employees for controlled substances shall use
                    reliable and minimally invasive examinations and screenings and be afforded the opportunity to select from a range of cost-effective and advanced drug testing technologies. The purpose of this Article is to establish procedural and
                    other requirements for the administration of controlled substance examinations.

                        between the protected activity and his firing, which was allegedly a retaliatory discharge in violation of the Retaliatory Employment Discrimination Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t95a21s95-241" target="_self">G.S. 95-241</a></cite>,
                        summary judgment was inappropriate. Bumgardner v. Spotless Enters., 287 F. Supp. 2d 630 (W.D.N.C. 2003).

                        issue of material fact where the employer claimed the employee was terminated for excessive absences, but the employee presented evidence that the employee was terminated due to the employee's "health claim." McDowell v. Cent.

                        Summary judgment on action brought under North Carolina Retaliatory Employment Discrimination Act was denied because the accident occurred on October 31, 2008, but the company did not immediately terminate the employee, instead terminating him on November
                        6, 2008, only two days after the company's doctor confirmed the employee had been injured and restricted him to light-duty work. Webb v. K.R. Drenth Trucking, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 2d 409 (W.D.N.C. 2011).

                        Trial court did not err in denying a sheriff and a surety summary judgment in a former employee's action asserting retaliatory termination because the sheriff waived governmental immunity by purchasing an official bond; the employee's claim, if supported
                        by adequate proof, came within the scope of the sheriff's official duties because she alleged that the sheriff wrongfully terminated her employment in retaliation for her decision to file a workers' compensation claim. White v.

        Jurisdictional Amount in Controversy.

                        threshold; court rejected the argument since a defense could not be used at that stage to reduce the amount in controversy, and defendant former employer showed by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff's claims for damages
                        for retaliatory discharge under exceeded $75,000 and plaintiff was not entitled to a remand. Lunsford v. Cemex, Inc., 733 F. Supp. 2d 652 (M.D.N.C. 2010).

                        did not specifically identify the capacity in which the sheriff was being sued, a trial court erred in dismissing the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the allegations in the complaint, the claims, and the
                        prayer for relief indicated the sheriff was sued in his official capacity; although the employee's right-to-sue letter named the "Sheriff's Department" as a party, the sheriff being sued in his official capacity was synonymous

                        is a finding of fact for the jury to decide, not for the judge. Morris v. Scenera Research, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 31, 747 S.E.2d 362 (2013).

                        achieved only limited success, the court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained when considering the allocation of attorneys' fees in a wage claim or employment retaliation

                        Attorney's Fee Award Required Further Findings of Fact. - Appellate court reversed the business court's award of attorneys' fees in an employment retaliation case and remanded the case for further findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding whether
                        the former employee's claims arose from a common nucleus of operative fact and, thus, whether he was entitled to all of his attorneys' fees because it should not have allocated the attorneys' fees among the claims on which he was
                        successful and those on which he was not. Morris v. Scenera Research, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 31, 747 S.E.2d 362 (2013).

                        because there was competent evidence to support the business court's determination that the employer did not willfully violate Retaliatory Employment Discrimination Act based on the jury rejecting the former employee's contention
                        that he resigned and giving no opinion on the employer's belief on the former employee's employment status. Morris v. Scenera Research, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 31, 747 S.E.2d 362 (2013).
