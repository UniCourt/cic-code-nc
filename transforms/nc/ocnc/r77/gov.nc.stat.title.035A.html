        Editor's Note.
       </b>
       - Session Laws 2018-47, s. 15, provides: "This act does not affect the coverage, eligibility, rights, responsibilities, or provision of State or federal services or benefits for individuals who have been diagnosed with mental retardation and whose diagnosis has not been changed to a diagnosis of intellectual disability."
      </p>
      <p>
       Session Laws 2018-47, s. 16, made the amendment of this section by Session Laws 2018-47, s. 1(b), effective October 1, 2018, and applicable to proceedings commenced on or after that date.

       <b>
        Effect of Amendments.
       </b>
       - Session Laws 2018-47, s. 1(b), made stylistic changes throughout the section; rewrote the introductory language; in subdivisions (4), (7), and (8)
   substituted "intellectual disability" for "mental retardation"; added subdivision (10a); and repealed former subdivision (13), which read: "Mental retardation' means significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested before age 22." For effective date and applicability, see editor's note.

        The appropriate test for establishing an adult incompetent is one of mental competence to manage one's own affairs. While there was competent evidence that a wife of an insurance policyholder was extremely and unfortunately injured by the accident, in and out of hospitals, and on and off of many painkillers, there was also evidence that she was able to name an attorney-in-fact to handle her insurance claims; the wife did not show sufficient competent evidence that her injury made her incapable of managing her own affairs to allow a disability tolling of the fraud statute of limitations under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa05s1-52" target="_blank">G.S. 1-52(9)</a></cite>.

        Statute vests discretion in the trial court, which may hold a hearing on appointing a guardian ad litem only for a parent who is incompetent, and the record established that the severity of the mother's mental health problems was well known to the trial court, but they did not rise to the level of incompetency, and the record contained facts in keeping with a finding of competency, including in part that she attended a vocational rehabilitation program, plus her denial of disability benefits was some evidence to support a finding of competency; the trial court did not err in not inquiring into her competency before holding a hearing to terminate her rights.

        Issue of Incompetence Becomes Moot Upon Death

        Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem.
   
   - Trial court terminated a mother's parental rights based on: (1) neglect; (2) wilfully leaving the children in foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress; (3) wilfully failing to provide financial support to the children; and (4) abandonment of the children for at least six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights; the mother did not request that a guardian ad litem (GAL) be appointed. Also, the petition for termination of her parental rights did not allege the mother's incapability to parent the children, and no allegations were asserted, and no showing was made that the mother was incompetent; thus, the trial court was not required to appoint a GAL to the mother under either <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-1101</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35As0Ia01s35A-1101" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1101</a></cite>, or G.S. 1A-1-17.

        It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to fail to inquire as to a mother's competency as: (1) the mother testified at the disposition hearing and the adjudication hearing about her employment; (2) the mention of the mother's emotional imbalance and a psychiatric evaluation, which found her to have a flare for dramatic behavior, to be easily excited, to be prone to emotional outbursts, to be overly sensitive to the opinions of others, and to be impulsive and rebellious, did not constitute a diagnosis of a mental health issue; (3) as the mother had made threats to harm the child, it was prudent to require a psychological evaluation before visitation resumed; and (4) doubting the mother's ability to parent the child did not necessarily indicate that the mother was incapable of handling her affairs for <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba11s7B-1101.1ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-1101.1(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35As0Ia01s35A-1101" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1101</a></cite> purposes.

        When the trial court entered adjudication and disposition orders finding the mother's two sons to be neglected and dependent juveniles, because the trial court determined that the mother could not adequately represent her own interests, and appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) to represent her, conducting the adjudication and disposition hearings without the presence and participation of the GAL for the mother was error.

        Because the psychologist who examined the mother diagnosed her with only a mild intellectual disability as she had been able to work and to attend school, she demonstrated that she had developed adaptive skills to lessen the impact of her disability, and, while working on her case plan, she completed empowerment classes to help address the issues of domestic violence in her relationship, the mother's disability did not rise to the level of incompetence requiring the appointment of a guardian ad litem to safeguard her interests in the termination of parental rights case, and the district court did not abuse the court's discretion when the court did not conduct an inquiry into the mother's competency.

        Clerk of Superior Court Retained Jurisdiction to Resolve Custody Dispute.
   
   - Trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine custody of a daughter who had been adjudicated an incompetent adult under N.C. Gen. Stat. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> because the clerk of superior court exercised its jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite>, to the exclusion of the trial court under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.8" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.8</a></cite> and retained jurisdiction to resolve the dispute regarding custody, and the parties were required to file a motion in the cause with the clerk to resolve the dispute; the clerk of superior court is the proper forum for determining custody disputes regarding a person previously adjudicated an incompetent adult and who has been provided a guardian under Chapter 35A.

        Burden of Proof.
   
   - Incompetency must be proven by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. In re Efird, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 638, 442 S.E.2d 381 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the order of incompetency was never entered, the clerk's appointment of a guardian was without legal authority. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 754 S.E.2d 168 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the incompetency order was effective only after its entry, the order could not be the law of the case. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 754 S.E.2d 168 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the incompetency order was not filed, it was not entered, and the time period to file notice of appeal had not yet started. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 754 S.E.2d 168 (2014).

        Order Not Entered.
   
   - Clerk orally rendered her decision finding respondent incompetent, and the order was reduced to writing and dated, but nothing indicated that the order was filed with the clerk of court, such that it was not entered.

Pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35As0Ia01s35A-1115" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1115</a></cite>, the husband was an interested part because he was entitled to notice of the incompetency proceeding.

   - Court of Appeals of North Carolina holds that <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35As0Ia01s35A-1115" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1115</a></cite> allows an aggrieved party to appeal from an order of the clerk of court determining the issue of incompetence, whether the order adjudges that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the respondent is incompetent, or whether the clerk adjudges that the respondent is incompetent. In re Dippel, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 791 S.E.2d 684 (2016).

       <p>
        Court of Appeals of North Carolina concludes, given the ubiquity of the right of appeal from the clerk of court to superior court and the absence of any limiting or restrictive language in the statute, that the only reasonable interpretation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35As0Ia01s35A-1115" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1115</a></cite> is that the statute allows appeal to superior court from any order of the clerk of court adjudicating the issue of incompetence.

        Trial court erred by dismissing a son's appeal from a superior court clerk's order that his father was competent where there was no question that the son was an aggrieved party, and thus entitled to appeal, and the trial court had ruled without benefit of the instant opinion, which was the first to directly address the scope of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35As0Ia01s35A-1115" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1115</a></cite>.

       Death of Respondent Abated Appeal
   
   - Sister's petition to declare her brother incompetent was nugatory after the death of the brother and did not survive the death of the brother; thus, the appeal abated and became moot upon the brother's death and was dismissed.

       Appointment Without Authority.
   
   - Because the order of incompetency was never entered, the clerk's appointment of a guardian was without legal authority. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 754 S.E.2d 168 (2014).

       The guardian, ward, or any other interested person may petition for restoration of the ward to competency by filing a motion in the cause of the incompetency proceeding with the clerk who is exercising jurisdiction therein. The motion shall be verified and shall set forth facts tending to show that the ward is competent.

       Upon receipt of the motion, the clerk shall set a date, time, and place for a hearing, which shall be not less than 10 days or more than 30 days from service of the motion and notice of hearing on the ward and the guardian, or on the one of them who is not the petitioner, unless the clerk for good cause directs otherwise. The petitioner shall cause notice and a copy of the motion to be served on the guardian and ward (but not on one who is the petitioner) and any other parties to the incompetency proceeding. Service shall be in accordance with provisions of G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4, Rules of Civil Procedure.

       At the hearing on the motion, the ward shall be entitled to be represented by counsel or guardian ad litem, and a guardian ad litem shall be appointed in accordance with rules adopted by the Office of Indigent Defense Services if the ward is indigent and not represented by counsel. Upon motion of any party or the clerk's own motion, the clerk may order a multidisciplinary evaluation. The ward has a right, upon request by him, his counsel, or his guardian ad litem to trial by jury. Failure to request a trial by jury shall constitute a waiver of the right. The clerk may nevertheless require trial by jury in accordance with G.S. 1A-1, Rule 39(b), Rules of Civil Procedure, by entering an order for trial by jury on his own motion.

Upon such adjudication, the ward is authorized to manage his or her affairs, make contracts, control and sell his or her property, both real and personal, and exercise all rights as if he or she had never been adjudicated incompetent. In addition, the clerk shall send a certified copy of the order adjudicating that the ward is restored to competency to the Division of Motor Vehicles.

          Some minors and incompetent persons, regardless of where they are living, require the assistance of a guardian in order to help them exercise their rights, including the management of their property and personal affairs.

         <li id="t35AsIIa04s35A-1201ol1a3">
          The essential purpose of guardianship for an incompetent person is to replace the individual's authority to make decisions with the authority of a guardian when the individual does not have adequate capacity to make such decisions.

         <li id="t35AsIIa04s35A-1201ol1a4">
          Limiting the rights of an incompetent person by appointing a guardian for him should not be undertaken unless it is clear that a guardian will give the individual a fuller capacity for exercising his rights.

         <li id="t35AsIIa04s35A-1201ol1a5">
          Guardianship should seek to preserve for the incompetent person the opportunity to exercise those rights that are within his comprehension and judgment, allowing for the possibility of error to the same degree as is allowed to persons who are not incompetent. To the maximum extent of his capabilities, an incompetent person should be permitted to participate as fully as possible in all decisions that will affect him.

          Minors, because they are legally incompetent to transact business or give consent for most purposes, need responsible, accountable adults to handle property or benefits to which they are entitled. Parents are the natural guardians of the person of their minor children, but unemancipated minors, when they do not have natural guardians, need some other responsible, accountable adult to be responsible for their personal welfare and for personal decision-making on their behalf.

        Death of Respondent Abated Appeal

        Related Custody Action Moot.
   
   - When a stepmother was granted ex parte temporary custody of orphaned stepchildren, an aunt's subsequent guardianship petition made the custody action moot because: (1) in the guardianship case, the clerk properly exercised jurisdiction, as the children had no natural guardian, and the clerk's jurisdiction was not divested by the ex parte temporary custody order, since the clerk considered other courts' custody awards, so the clerk had jurisdiction to appoint the children's general guardians, an incident of which was physical custody, and (2) any guardianship modification, including custody modification, required filing a motion with the clerk instead of a district court custody action.

<span class="s1">

     Many of the cases cited below were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.033.html#t33s33-1" target="_blank">G.S. 33-1</a></cite> and prior law.
     <br />

       <p>
        Clerk's Authority to Reopen Proceeding.
   
   - Clerk had original jurisdiction to appoint a guardian and could reopen the incompetency proceeding, where an interested party was not notified of the original proceeding. In re Ward, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 443</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 40 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>

        The powers which a court of equity formerly exercised
   
   in regard to orphans and their estates are now conferred upon the clerk of the superior court by former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.033.html#t33s33-1" target="_blank">G.S. 33-1</a></cite> and G.S. 33-6. Duffy v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 195</cite>, 45 S.E. 548 (1903).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The superior court has no power to appoint a general guardian,
   
   in the absence of other matters of which the court has jurisdiction. In re Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 702</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 231 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Residence of Infant.
   
   - The word "reside" as used in this section, relating to the appointment of guardians, has been construed to mean the domicile of the infant. And a legitimate child, whose father is alive, takes at birth, and continues during minority, the domicile of his father, following it as it changes. Upon the death of the father his domicile at death continues to be the domicile of his minor child until the domicile of such child is legally changed. In re Hall's Guardianship, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 697</cite>, 71 S.E.2d 140 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where both parents of an infant are dead and he is taken to the home of his paternal grandparents and resides with them, regardless of what theretofore may have been his domicile, the domicile of his grandparents then becomes his domicile. Hence, the clerk of superior court of the county in which the grandparents reside has jurisdiction of him. In re Hall's Guardianship, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 697</cite>, 71 S.E.2d 140 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appointment by General Assembly.
   
   - An act of the General Assembly authorizing a certain person "to act as guardian" of another without giving bond, is constitutional, and is in itself an appointment without intervention of the clerk. Henderson v. Bowed, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 795</cite>, 21 S.E. 692 (1895).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The appointment of a guardian is a matter of discretion,
   
   the exercise of which cannot be reviewable by the Supreme Court. Battle v. Vick, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. 294</cite> (1833).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Not Bound by Choice of the Minor.
   
   - In early cases it was held that the court in appointing a guardian was not bound by the choice of the minor, but could appoint the person, who, in its discretion, would best perform the duty. Wynne v. Always, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. 38</cite> (1804); Grant v. Whitaker, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. 231</cite> (1809).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Person Related to Ward.
   
   - Courts are empowered to appoint as guardian such person as they may think proper, without regard to the kinship of the guardian to the ward. Mills v. McAllister, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. 303</cite> (1796).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Custody of Child.
   
   - The jurisdiction of superior court clerks in the appointment of guardians of infants, etc., does not extend to a case where the petitioner asks for the custody of a child who had been placed by its mother under the control of another. In re Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. 31</cite> (1883).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Custody of Incompetent Adult.
   
   - District court has concurrent jurisdiction with the clerk of superior court with respect to custody of disabled adult children because the district court obtains jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.8" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.8</a></cite> to determine custody only when the disabled adult child at issue has not been declared incompetent and had a guardian appointed; while the superior court clerk retains jurisdiction over all guardianship matters under N.C. Gen. Stat. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite>, obviously not all disabled adult children are declared incompetent and provided guardians, and in those instances, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.8" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.8</a></cite> fills the gap, authorizing the district court to determine custody. McKoy v. McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 689 S.E.2d 590 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine custody of a daughter who had been adjudicated an incompetent adult under N.C. Gen. Stat. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> because the clerk of superior court exercised its jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite>, to the exclusion of the trial court under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.8" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.8</a></cite> and retained jurisdiction to resolve the dispute regarding custody, and the parties were required to file a motion in the cause with the clerk to resolve the dispute; the clerk of superior court is the proper forum for determining custody disputes regarding a person previously adjudicated an incompetent adult and who has been provided a guardian under Chapter 35A. McKoy v. McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 689 S.E.2d 590 (2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Removal of Guardian.
   
   - A ward may not bring an action in the superior court by her next friend to remove her guardian appointed by the clerk. Moses v. Moses, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 657</cite>, 169 S.E. 273 (1933).

   - When one is appointed as guardian for a minor, his right to act terminates when the ward reaches his majority. In re Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 184</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 614 (1962).

        Contractual Relationship with Defendant.
   
   - In a case in which plaintiff appealed from an order dismissing her claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the appellate court agreed with plaintiff that the district court has jurisdiction to hear plaintiff's claim regarding her contractual relationship with defendant, in her individual capacity. Accordingly, the appellate court reversed the district court's order to the extent that it dismissed plaintiff's claim against defendant, in her individual capacity, for $20,499.52. Morgan-McCoart v. Matchette, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 781 S.E.2d 809 (2016).

        A clerk of superior court may appoint a guardian
   
   of the person when there is no natural guardian for a minor.

         Clerk of Court as "Court of Competent Jurisdiction."
        </b>
        - If a purchaser or beneficiary of a preneed contract has been adjudicated incompetent, the clerk of the superior court is a "court of competent jurisdiction" and a hearing should be held in order for the clerk to make findings establishing that it is in the best interest of the ward to revoke the contract. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. William R. Hoke, Attorney for the North Carolina State Board of Mortuary Science, - N.C.A.G. - (November 3, 1995).

        Residence of Infant.
   
   - The word "reside" as used in former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.033.html#t33s33-1" target="_blank">G.S. 33-1</a></cite> relating to the appointment of guardians has been construed to mean the domicile of the infant. And a legitimate child, whose father is alive, takes at birth, and continues during minority, the domicile of his father - following is as it changes. Upon the death of the father his domicile at death continues to be the domicile of his minor child until the domicile of such child is legally changed. In re Hall's Guardianship, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 697</cite>, 71 S.E.2d 140 (1952).

       <p>
        Where both parents of an infant are dead and he is taken to the home of his paternal grandparents and resides with them, regardless of what theretofore may have been his domicile, the domicile of his grandparents then becomes his domicile. Hence, the clerk of superior court of the county in which the grandparents reside has jurisdiction of him. In re Hall's Guardianship, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 697</cite>, 71 S.E.2d 140 (1952).

        Clerk of Superior Court Has Power to Determine Whether Incompetent's Spouse Is Granted Support.
   
   - The clerk of superior court - after first ensuring that the estate is ample to meet the expenses of caring for the incompetent has residual equitable power under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> to examine the facts and circumstances of the case to determine whether the incompetent's spouse should be granted support from her husband's estate and the right to continue to live in his home; factors the clerk may consider include the size and condition of the estate, the present and future demands against it, and the spouse's needs.

        Clerk of Superior Court Retained Jurisdiction to Resolve Custody Dispute.
   
   - Trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine custody of a daughter who had been adjudicated an incompetent adult under N.C. Gen. Stat. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> because the clerk of superior court exercised its jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite>, to the exclusion of the trial court under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.8" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.8</a></cite> and retained jurisdiction to resolve the dispute regarding custody, and the parties were required to file a motion in the cause with the clerk to resolve the dispute; the clerk of superior court is the proper forum for determining custody disputes regarding a person previously adjudicated an incompetent adult and who has been provided a guardian under Chapter 35A. McKoy v. McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 689 S.E.2d 590 (2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court was not the proper forum in which to seek spousal support
   
   from the estate of an incompetent; the superior court is the only proper division to hear matters regarding the administration of incompetents' estates; therefore, the incompetent's spouse should have made her demand for support before the clerk of superior court either as a motion in the cause pursuant to this section, or as a special proceeding for the sale of her husband's property under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35AsIIIa14s35A-1307" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1307</a></cite>.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The estate of an incompetent may not be so depleted in favor of a spouse as to compromise the quality of care
   
   provided to the incompetent, or to force the incompetent to become a public charge; rather, in the limited instance in which an incompetent's estate is ample to provide for his own care and maintenance, an award of spousal support may properly be charged against the estate.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If the guardian questions the propriety of a particular charge against the estate,
   
   he may seek prior court approval before making payment by filing a motion in the cause with the superior court clerk. Cline v. Teich, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 374 S.E.2d 462 (1988).

     Many of the cases cited below were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html#t35a1As35-1.6" target="_blank">G.S. 35-1.6</a></cite> and 35-2 and prior law.

       <p>
        Nature of Proceeding.
   
   - An inquisition under this section as regards the person whose sanity is in question is a proceeding in personam; as it affects his property is a proceeding in rem. Such an inquisition is certainly not a criminal action as contemplated by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Ia01s1-5" target="_blank">G.S. 1-5</a></cite>. It is not a civil action as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Ia01s1-2" target="_blank">G.S. 1-2</a></cite>. And by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Ia01s1-3" target="_blank">G.S. 1-3</a></cite> "every other remedy is a special proceeding." Certainly such an inquisition is of a civil nature, though it would seem it is not a special proceeding under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Ia01s1-3" target="_blank">G.S. 1-3</a></cite>. In re Dunn, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 378</cite>, 79 S.E.2d 921 (1954).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard.
   
   - When a party's lack of mental capacity is asserted and denied, and he has not previously been adjudicated incompetent to manage his affairs, he is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard before either a next friend or a guardian ad litem can be appointed for him. Hagins v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 90</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is fundamental that one accused of incompetency is entitled to notice of the proceedings and a reasonable opportunity to rebut the allegations of the petition. In re Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 215 S.E.2d 631 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice to Alleged Incompetent Serves Function of Summons.
   
   - The effect of former section is to provide that the proceeding may be commenced by the filing of the petition, and that the inquisition may be held upon the notice therein provided being served upon the alleged incompetent, thereby dispensing with the necessity of issuing a summons. The notice to an incompetent to appear at a time and place named to present evidence and show cause, if any, why he should not be declared incompetent serves every function of a summons. In re Barker, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 617</cite>, 188 S.E. 205 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Presence of Party.
   
   - The person alleged to be incompetent has a right to be present at the inquest, and if this right be denied him, it is good cause for setting aside the inquisition. Bethea v. McLennon, <cite class="nc_code">23 N.C. 523</cite> (1841).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Traverse Inquisition.
   
   - From the earliest times the common law and the course of the legislation in common-law states has guarded sedulously the right of persons accused of incompetency of any kind to traverse the inquisition or other proceeding in the nature of one de lunatico inquirendo. Hagins v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 90</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusiveness of Adjudication.
   
   - An adjudication of insanity is conclusive as to the parties to the proceeding and their privies, but as to others it is evidence of incompetency and raises a mere presumption to that effect which is not conclusive but may be rebutted. Medical College v. Maynard, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 506</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 315 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        The executed contract of a mentally incompetent person is ordinarily voidable and not void. If, however, the person has been adjudged incompetent from want of understanding to manage his affairs and the court has appointed a guardian for him, he is conclusively presumed insane insofar as parties and privies to the guardianship proceedings are concerned; as to all others, it is presumptive (but rebuttable) proof of the ward's incapacity. Chesson v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 98</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 40 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The test for mental competence
   
   to enter into a release is the same as that controlling the running of the statute of limitations, i.e., whether at the time of execution of the release, the party challenging the release had the mental competence to manage his own affairs. Cox v. Jefferson-Pilot Fire &amp; Cas. Co., <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 122, 341 S.E.2d 608, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 702</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 38 (1986).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The word "affairs"
   
   encompasses a person's entire property and business, not just one transaction or one piece of property to which he may have a unique attachment. Hagins v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 90</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969).

        Test of Incompetence to Manage Own Affairs.
   
   - Under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html#t35a02s35-2" target="_blank">G.S. 35-2</a></cite>, if a person's mental condition is such that he is incapable of transacting the ordinary business involved in taking care of his property, if he is incapable of exercising rational judgment and weighing the consequences of his acts upon himself, his family, his property and estate, he is incompetent to manage his affairs. On the other hand, if he understands what is necessarily required for the management of his ordinary business affairs and is able to perform those acts with reasonable continuity, if he comprehends the effect of what he does, and can exercise his own will, he is not lacking in understanding within the meaning of the law, and he cannot be deprived of the control of his litigation or property. Hagins v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 90</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>

        There is no completely satisfactory definition of the phrase "incompetent from want of understanding to manage his own affairs."

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Incompetency to administer one's property obviously depends upon the general frame and habit of mind,
   
   and not upon specific actions, such as may be reflected by eccentricities, prejudices, or the holding of particular beliefs. Hagins v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 90</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969).
   <br />

        More Efficient Management of Property by Another Is Insufficient Ground.
   
   - To authorize the appointment of next friend or guardian ad litem, it is not enough to show that another might manage a man's property more wisely or efficiently than he himself. Hagins v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 90</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969).

        Mental incapacity is only cause for appointment of a guardian under this section.
   
   Former section does not make physical incapacity alone, however complete, grounds for such appointment. Goodson v. Lehmon, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 616</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 756 (1944).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Ward Presumed to Lack Capacity after Guardian Appointed.
   
   - Where a person has been adjudged incompetent for want of understanding to manage his own affairs, under former section, and the court has appointed a guardian, and not a trustee, the ward is conclusively presumed to lack mental capacity to manage his own affairs, insofar as parties and privies to the proceeding are concerned; and, while not conclusive as to others, it is presumptive, and the presumption continues unless rebutted in a proper proceeding. Sutton v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 274</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 553 (1942).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An inquisition is not always a condition precedent for the appointment of a next friend or a guardian ad litem.
   
   In an emergency, when it is necessary, pendente lite, to safeguard the property of a person non compos mentis whose incompetency has not been adjudicated, the protection of the court may be invoked in his behalf by one acting as next friend. Hagins v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 90</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Substantial Difference between Next Friend and Guardian Ad Litem.
   
   - Although technically a next friend represents a plaintiff and a guardian ad litem represents a defendant, there is no substantial difference between the two. Hagins v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 90</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The class of persons for whom next friends and guardians ad litem may be appointed are the same.
   
   Hagins v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 90</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither a next friend nor a guardian ad litem has authority to receive money or administer the litigant's property.
   
   His powers are coterminous with the beginning and end of the litigation in which he is appointed. Hagins v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 90</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 490 (1969).

If both parents make such recommendations, the will with the latest date shall, in the absence of other relevant factors, prevail. Such recommendation shall be a strong guide for the clerk in appointing a guardian, but the clerk is not bound by the recommendation if the clerk finds that a different appointment is in the incompetent adult's best interest. If the will specifically so directs, a guardian appointed pursuant to such recommendation may be permitted to qualify and serve without giving bond, unless the clerk finds as a fact that the interest of the incompetent adult would be best served by requiring the guardian to give bond.

       Related Custody Action Moot.
   
   - When a stepmother was granted ex parte temporary custody of orphaned stepchildren, an aunt's subsequent guardianship petition made the custody action moot because (1) in the guardianship case, the clerk properly exercised jurisdiction, as the children had no natural guardian, and the clerk's jurisdiction was not divested by the ex parte temporary custody order, since the clerk considered other courts' custody awards, so the clerk had jurisdiction to appoint the children's general guardians, an incident of which was physical custody, and (2) any guardianship modification, including custody modification, required filing a motion with the clerk instead of a district court custody action.

     <p>
      The clerk shall receive evidence necessary to determine whether a guardian of the person, a guardian of the estate, or a general guardian is required. If the court determines that a guardian or guardians are required, the court shall receive evidence necessary to determine the minor's assets, liabilities, and needs, and who the guardian or guardians shall be. The hearing may be informal and the clerk may consider whatever testimony, written reports, affidavits, documents, or other evidence the clerk finds necessary to determine the minor's best interest.

       Related Custody Action Moot.
   
   - When a stepmother was granted ex parte temporary custody of orphaned stepchildren, an aunt's subsequent guardianship petition made the custody action moot because (1) in the guardianship case, the clerk properly exercised jurisdiction, as the children had no natural guardian, and the clerk's jurisdiction was not divested by the ex parte temporary custody order, since the clerk considered other courts' custody awards, so the clerk had jurisdiction to appoint the children's general guardians, an incident of which was physical custody, and (2) any guardianship modification, including custody modification, required filing a motion with the clerk instead of a district court custody action. Corbett v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 40, 795 S.E.2d 564 (2016).

       Appointment of Person to Receive Minor's Death Benefits.
   
   - Clerk of Superior Court may not appoint a "general guardian" for a minor if a natural guardian, such as a biological mother, exists; however, clerk of Superior Court may appoint "some other person" to receive death benefits on behalf of minor.

       Parents are presumed to know the best interest of their children. Any parent may by last will and testament recommend a guardian for any of his or her minor children, whether born at the parent's death or en ventre sa mere, for such time as the child remains under 18 years of age, unmarried, and unemancipated, or for any less time. Such will may be made without regard to whether the testator is an adult or a minor. If both parents make such recommendations, the will with the latest date shall, in the absence of other relevant factors, prevail. In the absence of a surviving parent, such recommendation shall be a strong guide for the clerk in appointing a guardian, but the clerk is not bound by the recommendation if the clerk finds that a different appointment is in the minor's best interest. If the will specifically so directs, a guardian appointed pursuant to such recommendation may be permitted to qualify and serve without giving bond, unless the clerk finds as a fact that the interest of the minor would be best served by requiring the guardian to give bond.
      </li>
      <li id="t35AsIIa06s35A-1225ol1b">
       Any person authorized by law to recommend a guardian for a minor by his last will and testament or other writing may direct that the guardian appointed for his incompetent child shall petition the clerk during the six months before the child reaches majority for an adjudication of incompetence and appointment of a guardian under the provisions of this Chapter. If so directed, the guardian shall timely file such a petition unless the minor is no longer incompetent. Notwithstanding the absence of such provision in a will or other writing, the guardian of an incompetent child, or any other person, may file such petition during the six months before the minor reaches majority or thereafter.

       Appointment by Will.
   
   - A last will and testament cannot operate to appoint a guardian for an adult child regardless of the disability. In re Efird, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 638, 442 S.E.2d 381 (1994).

       Bequest to Son as Trustee for Grandchildren.
   
   - Testatrix bequeathed certain property to her grandchildren with subsequent provisions that it was her will and desire that her son be appointed their guardian and that the guardian should hold and manage the property for the grandchildren with power to sell, convey or exchange the securities. It was held that since testatrix could not appoint a testamentary guardian for her grandchildren the provisions will be interpreted as bequeathing the property to testatrix' son as trustee for testatrix' grandchildren, in order that each provision of the instrument be given effect consistent with testatrix' intention. Johnson v. Salsbury, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 432</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 327 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Interpretation of Will.
   
   - Where it can clearly be collected from the will of a father that certain persons are thereby appointed to have the custody of the persons and the estate of his children, until they arrive at age, such an appointment will be held to constitute them guardians, as though the appropriate term had been used. Peyton v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. 325</cite> (1839).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Rights of Both Parents Are Recognized.
   
   - In former sections and other statutes, the legislature has recognized the human as well as the legal relation between parent and child, the paramount and the subordinate, the present and the inchoate, rights of the father and the mother, and has wisely provided that both the parents shall have adequate opportunity to be heard and, except in rare cases, shall give their consent before the legal relation is severed or the domestic circle is broken.

      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption of Giving of Bond.
   
   - When the fact that a guardian was appointed is admitted, a presumption arises that a guardian bond was given, since such a bond is a prerequisite to the appointment. Kello v. Maget, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. 414</cite> (1835).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Denial of Guardianship Not Permissible.
   
   - Where there is evidence that one had been appointed and had acted as guardian, neither he nor his administrators can deny that he was guardian on the ground that he had not given bond. Latham v. Wilcox, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. 367</cite>, 6 S.E. 711 (1888).
      </p>
      <p>
       The surety on a guardianship bond is estopped to deny the validity of the appointment of a guardian when the bond signed by the surety recites that the guardian has been duly appointed. Phipps v. Royal Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 561</cite>, 161 S.E. 69 (1931).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Omission by the clerk to take the bond required
   
   on the appointment of a guardian does not destroy the efficacy of the appointment. Howerton v. Sexton, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 75</cite>, 10 S.E. 148 (1889).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability on Bond.
   
   - A guardian and his bondsmen are liable for all moneys due his wards which he has collected or ought to have collected. Loftin v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 58</cite>, 35 S.E. 230 (1900).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the administrator of a former guardian himself becomes guardian,
   
   he and his guardian bondsmen become liable for any balance due from the solvent estate of the former guardian. Loftin v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 58</cite>, 35 S.E. 230 (1900).

      <li id="t35AsIIa07s35A-1231ol1a">
       Before issuing letters of appointment to a general guardian or guardian of the estate the clerk shall require the guardian to give a bond payable to the State. The clerk shall determine the value of all the ward's personal property and the rents and profits of the ward's real estate by examining, under oath, the applicant for guardianship or any other person or persons. The penalty in the bond shall be set as follows:
       <ol>
        <li id="t35AsIIa07s35A-1231ol1a1">
         Where the bond is executed by personal sureties, the penalty must be at least double the value so determined by the clerk;

        <li id="t35AsIIa07s35A-1231ol1a2">
         Where the bond is executed by a duly authorized surety company, the penalty may be fixed at not less than one and one-fourth times the value so determined by the clerk;

        <li id="t35AsIIa07s35A-1231ol1a3">
         Provided, however, the clerk may accept bond in estates where the value determined by the clerk exceeds the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), in a sum equal to one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the determined value.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t35AsIIa07s35A-1231ol1b">
       If the court orders a sale of the ward's real property, or if the guardian expects or offers to sell personal property that he knows or has reason to know has a value greater than the value used in determining the amount of the bond posted, the guardian shall, before receiving the proceeds of the sale, furnish bond or increase his existing bond to cover the proceeds if real estate is sold, or to cover the increased value if personal property is sold. The bond, or the increase in the existing bond, shall be twice the amount of the proceeds of any real property sold, or of the increased value of any personal property sold, except where the bond is executed by a duly authorized surety company, in which case the penalty of the bond need not exceed one and one-fourth times the amount of the real property sold or the increased value of the personal property sold.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The bond must be secured with two or more sufficient sureties, jointly and severally bound, and must be acknowledged before and approved by the clerk. The bond must be conditioned on the guardian's faithfully executing the trust reposed in him as such and obeying all lawful orders of the clerk or judge relating to the guardianship of the estate committed to him. The bond must be recorded in the office of the clerk appointing the guardian, except, if the guardianship is transferred to a different county, it must be recorded in the office of the clerk in the county where the guardianship is docketed.

      </p>
      <p>
       Former section contemplates that the bond shall be signed and acknowledged
   
   by the guardian as principal, as well as by the sureties. Cheshire v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 566</cite>, 178 S.E. 348 (1935).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Acceptance without Guardian's Signature Is an Irregularity.
   
   - The acceptance and approval of the bond by the clerk of the superior court without the signature of the guardian as principal is an irregularity, but such irregularity does not render the bond void either as to the principal or as to his sureties. Cheshire v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 566</cite>, 178 S.E. 348 (1935).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A guardian's bond is not strictly a record of the court,
   
   although the fact that it was made and accepted may be. An action may therefore be brought on the bond after its loss or destruction, without any previous application to the court to restore it as a record. Harrell v. Hare, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. 658</cite> (1874).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Insert Penalty.
   
   - A guardian's bond is not binding on the sureties thereto where it did not state the amount of the penalty at the time it was signed, and they did not afterwards authorize anyone to insert the amount. Rollins v. Ebbs, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 355</cite>, 49 S.E. 341 (1904), aff'd on rehearing, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 140</cite>, 50 S.E. 577 (1905).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Collect Money.
   
   - Where a guardian ought to receive a certain amount of money and does not, but takes something else, his own bond for instance, in place of the money, he and his sureties are liable. State ex rel. Avent v. Womack, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 397</cite> (1875).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank Intermingling Trust Funds.
   
   - A bank, as guardian, in not investing the funds of its ward, but intermingling them with other funds of the bank, was faithless to the trust reposed in it; and, under the terms of this action, its bondsman must suffer the loss for such faithlessness. Roebuck v. National Sur. Co., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 196</cite>, 156 S.E. 531 (1931).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Responsible for Laches.
   
   - A guardian is responsible on his bond for any loss resulting from his laches in failing to sue. Cross v. Craven, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 331</cite>, 26 S.E. 940 (1897).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Limit of Liability for Realty.
   
   - The guardian's bond is not responsible in any way for the realty beyond the rents and profits. Cross v. Craven, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 331</cite>, 26 S.E. 940 (1897).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability on Note for Ward's Board.
   
   - The sureties on a guardian's bond are not responsible for the nonpayment of a note given by the guardian, and signed by him as guardian, for the board and tuition of his ward. McKinnon v. McKinnon, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. 201</cite> (1879).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Surety as a Party in Interest.
   
   - When a guardian fails to "faithfully execute the trust reposed in him as such," upon which his bond is conditioned, the surety thereon is subjected to liability, and as a party in interest is entitled to have the wrong remedied. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Lawing, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 8</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 183 (1943).

       When it appears that the ward's estate includes money that has been or will be deposited in an account with a financial institution upon condition that the money will not be withdrawn except on authorization of the court, the court may, in its discretion, order that the money be so deposited or invested and exclude such deposited money from the computation of the amount of the bond or reduce the amount of the bond in respect of such money to such an amount as it may deem reasonable.

       The applicant for letters of guardianship, or a general guardian or guardian of the estate, may deliver to any such financial institution any such money in the applicant's or the guardian's possession or may allow such financial institution to retain any such money already deposited or invested with it; in either event, the applicant or guardian shall secure and file with the court a written receipt including the agreement of the financial institution, duly acknowledged by an authorized officer of the financial institution, that the money shall not be allowed to be withdrawn except on authorization of the court. In so receiving and retaining such money from an applicant for letters of guardianship, the financial institution shall be protected to the same extent as though it had received the same from a general guardian or a guardian of the estate.

       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction of Action.
   
   - The clerk has no jurisdiction of a suit on a guardian's bond. Such suit must be brought in the superior court. Rowland v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 110</cite> (1871).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Action in Name of State.
   
   - An action on a guardian's bond should be in the name of the State, for the benefit of the plaintiff, and not in the name of the plaintiff. Carmichael v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. 29</cite> (1883); Williams v. McNair, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 332</cite>, 4 S.E. 131 (1887); Norman v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 24</cite>, 7 S.E. 468 (1888).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Proper Relator.
   
   - When the share of an infant in an estate in the hands of his guardian is assigned, the assignee, and not the infant, is the proper relator in an action on the guardian's bond. State ex rel. Petty v. Rousseau, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 355</cite> (1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       A creditor of a guardian is not the proper relator in an action upon his bond. McKinnon v. McKinnon, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. 201</cite> (1879).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Unnecessary Parties.
   
   - In an action against the surety on a guardian's bond, when the guardian has defaulted and his whereabouts is unknown, and the defendant is the sole surety, and claims that the guardian, who was assistant clerk of the superior court, had given to the clerk a bond for the faithful performance of his duties as assistant clerk, neither the clerk nor the bonding company on the assistant clerk's bond is a necessary or proper party to said action. Phipps v. Royal Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 561</cite>, 161 S.E. 69 (1931).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Condition of Bond Set Out in Complaint.
   
   - In an action on a guardian's bond, it is necessary that conditions of the bond which are alleged to have been broken should be set forth in the complaint. McKinnon v. McKinnon, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. 201</cite> (1879).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Bond Must Be Proved.
   
   - A guardian's bond is not a record, and, before it can be read in evidence in any case, it must be proved like all other bonds. Butler v. Durham, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. 589</cite> (1845).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of a balance in the hands of a guardian
   
   as shown of his annual account was admissible against a surety under the Laws of 1884. Loftin v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 58</cite>, 35 S.E. 230 (1900).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Defenses.
   
   - The same defense which might be made to an action at law or suit in equity, brought in the name of the ward himself against the guardian, is good in an action brought on the guardian's bond. State ex rel. Clark v. Cordon, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. 179</cite> (1847).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Defenses - Settlement.
   
   - Where in a suit on a guardian's bond it appeared that the account between the guardian and the ward had been settled, and that the guardian gave his own bond to the ward, which was received by the latter in satisfaction of the balance due, and he then gave his guardian a receipt, this was a sufficient defense to the suit on the bond. State ex rel. Clark v. Cordon, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. 179</cite> (1847).
      </p>
      <p>
       A full settlement of a suit brought by a ward on a guardian's bond, made after the ward becomes of age, in the presence of the ward's mother, and by the advice of her counsel, and a final judgment thereon, is a bar to a subsequent action on the bond. State ex rel. Dean v. Ragsdale, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 215</cite> (1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       An action by the ward against the sureties on the bond of the guardian is barred after three years from the time the ward becomes 21 years old if the guardian makes no final settlement, and within six years if the guardian makes a final settlement. Self v. Shugart, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 185</cite>, 47 S.E. 484 (1904).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Amount of Recovery.
   
   - In an action upon a guardian's bond the recovery against either the principal or the surety cannot exceed the penalty thereof, but should be for the penal sum of the bond, and to be discharged on payment of the damages sustained. Anthony v. Estes, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 541</cite>, 8 S.E. 347 (1888).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Amount of Recovery - Measure of Damages.
   
   - The measure of damages in an action upon a guardian's bond for a failure to perform any duty required of him is the amount of the principal received, with compound interest at 6% until the ward arrives at full age. Topping v. Windley, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. 4</cite>, 5 S.E. 14 (1888).

       § 35A-1236. Renewal of bond.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every guardian who is required to post a bond and who does so other than through a duly authorized surety company shall renew his bond before the clerk every three years during the continuance of the guardianship. The clerk shall issue a citation against every such guardian failing to renew his bond, requiring the guardian to renew the bond within 20 days after service of the citation. On return of the citation duly served and failure of the guardian to comply, the clerk shall remove the guardian and appoint a successor. This section shall not apply to a guardian whose bond is executed by a duly authorized surety company.

       An ordinary guardian has no fixed term of office.
   
   While the former statute requires a renewal of the bond every three years there is no requirement for a new appointment. Thornton v. Barbour, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 583</cite>, 169 S.E. 153 (1933).

       Liability for Failure to Enforce Renewal.
   
   - A clerk and his sureties are not liable upon his official bond for his failure to issue a citation requiring a guardian to renew his bond. State ex rel. Jones v. Biggs, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. 364</cite> (1854); Sullivan v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 500</cite> (1870).

       § 35A-1237. Relief of endangered sureties.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any surety of a guardian, who is in danger of sustaining loss by his suretyship, may file a motion in the cause before the clerk where the guardianship is docketed, setting forth the circumstances of his case and demanding relief. The guardian shall have 10 days after service of the motion to answer the motion. If, upon the hearing, the clerk deems the surety entitled to relief, the clerk may order the guardian to give a new bond or to indemnify the surety against apprehended loss, or may remove the guardian from his trust. If the guardian fails to give a new bond or security to indemnify within a reasonable time when required to do so, the clerk must enter a peremptory order for his removal, and his authority as guardian shall cease.

       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       A surety is not discharged from liability by the guardian giving a new bond
   
   with other sureties. Jones v. Blanton, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. 115</cite> (1848).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       New Bond Is Additional Security.
   
   - When, under former section, new sureties are ordered to be given, the obligation of the bond given by the new sureties extends to the entire guardianship, retrospective as well as prospective. Such a bond is at least an additional and cumulative security for the ward. Bell's Adm'r v. Jasper, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. 597</cite> (1843).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       And where a guardian gives several successive bonds, the sureties on each stand in the relation of cosureties
   
   to the sureties on every other bond; the only qualification to the rule being that the sureties are bound to contribution only according to the amount of the penalty of the bond in which each class is bound. Jones v. Hays, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. 502</cite> (1845); Thornton v. Barbour, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 583</cite>, 169 S.E. 153 (1933).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where Counter-Security Given.
   
   - Where the sureties of a guardian obtained an order for counter-security, and at that time the guardian owed his ward, and never afterwards returned an account nor made a payment, no presumption of satisfaction at that or any subsequent time arose from the fact that he was then able to pay the sum he owed; and the sureties on the first bond were liable for it, though the order for counter-security expressly released them. Foye v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. 475</cite> (1836).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The clerk is not empowered by any express statute to release sureties,
   
   upon bonds approved by him, especially at a time when the principal is in default. Former section provides a remedy for dissatisfied sureties upon guardian bonds, but release is not one of the remedies therein contemplated. Thornton v. Barbour, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 583</cite>, 169 S.E. 153 (1933).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Successor Guardian and Ward Are Not Bound by Adjudication if Not Parties.
   
   - A determination in a proceeding between the surety and the former guardian is not conclusive as against a successor guardian and the ward, neither of whom was a party to that proceeding when the adjudication was made. State ex rel. N.W. Bank v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 234</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 396 (1966).

      </p>
      <p>
       A clerk and sureties on his official bond are liable for loss resulting from a failure to take a good guardian's bond,
   
   and the record of the appointment of the guardian is sufficient evidence of such appointment. Topping v. Windley, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. 4</cite>, 5 S.E. 14 (1888).
      </p>
      <p>
       The giving of the bond required of a guardian is not essential to the validity of the appointment itself. The failure to take the bond, however, subjects the clerk to the consequences of such omission. Howerton v. Sexton, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 75</cite>, 10 S.E. 148 (1889).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Action Lies.
   
   - No action can be maintained on the bond given by a clerk conditioned for the faithful performance of his duty, except where there have been such damages sustained as would give the party a right to maintain an action on the case for the neglect of his official duty. State ex rel. Jones v. Briggs, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. 364</cite> (1854).

       <ol>
        <li id="t35AsIIa08s35A-1241ol1a1">
         The guardian of the person is entitled to custody of the person of the guardian's ward and shall make provision for the ward's care, comfort, and maintenance, and shall, as appropriate to the ward's needs, arrange for the ward's training, education, employment, rehabilitation, or habilitation. The guardian of the person shall take reasonable care of the ward's clothing, furniture, vehicles, and other personal effects that are with the ward.
        </li>
        <li id="t35AsIIa08s35A-1241ol1a2">
         The guardian of the person may establish the ward's place of abode inside or outside this State. In arranging for a place of abode, the guardian of the person shall give preference to places inside this State over places outside this State if in-State and out-of-State places are substantially equivalent. The guardian also shall give preference to places that are not treatment facilities. If the only available and appropriate places of domicile are treatment facilities, the guardian shall give preference to community-based treatment facilities, such as group homes or nursing homes, over treatment facilities that are not community-based.
        </li>
        <li id="t35AsIIa08s35A-1241ol1a3">
         The guardian of the person may give any consent or approval that may be necessary to enable the ward to receive medical, legal, psychological, or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or service. If the patient has a health care agent appointed pursuant to a valid health care power of attorney, the health care agent shall have the right to exercise the authority granted in the health care power of attorney unless the Clerk has suspended the authority of that health care agent in accordance with G.S. 35A-1208. The guardian shall not, however, consent to the sterilization of a ward with a mental illness or intellectual disability unless the guardian obtains an order from the clerk in accordance with G.S. 35A-1245. The guardian of the person may give any other consent or approval on the ward's behalf that may be required or in the ward's best interest. The guardian may petition the clerk for the clerk's concurrence in the consent or approval.

       Powers of Appointment.
   
   - Given supreme court precedent, the limited powers granted to a guardian of the person in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35AsIIa08s35A-1241" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1241</a></cite>, and the implied requirement of North Carolina's Rules of Civil Procedure, which imposed the requirement of appointment of a guardian ad litem where no general or testamentary guardian had been appointed under G.S. 1A-1-17(b)(2), a ward of a guardian of the person was neither properly sued nor served in the absence of a guardian ad litem or general guardian, and the verdict against the ward was set aside. Clawser v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 646 S.E.2d 779 (2007).

      <p>
       Supervision of Guardian by Clerk of Trial Court.
   
   - In a disciplinary proceeding against an attorney for misappropriating the client's property, the attorney's explanation had to be rejected that the client wanted the attorney to hold the client's funds because the client was afraid her relatives, including the guardian, would steal the property. The guardian, once appointed, had various powers pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35AsIIa08s35A-1241" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1241</a></cite>, but was also subject to supervision by the clerk of the trial court and also would be responsible for any loss of her property.

      <p>
       Related Custody Action Moot.
   
   - When a stepmother was granted ex parte temporary custody of orphaned stepchildren, an aunt's subsequent guardianship petition made the custody action moot because, (1) in the guardianship case, the clerk properly exercised jurisdiction, as the children had no natural guardian, and the clerk's jurisdiction was not divested by the ex parte temporary custody order, since the clerk considered other courts' custody awards, so the clerk had jurisdiction to appoint the children's general guardians, an incident of which was physical custody, and (2) any guardianship modification, including custody modification, required filing a motion with the clerk instead of a district court custody action. Corbett v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 40, 795 S.E.2d 564 (2016).

      <p>
       Award of Attorney's Fees.
   
   - Given that the guardian of the person had the right to employ legal assistance for the benefit of the ward, the trial court had ample statutory authority to authorize payment of attorney's fees to the attorney and law firm for work performed on behalf of the ward and the guardian of the person pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35AsIIa08s35A-1241" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1241(3)</a></cite>.

        Legislative Classification Is Reasonable.
   
   - Considering the object of this Article (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35</a></cite>, Article 7), which is to prevent the procreation of children by a mentally ill or retarded individual who probably would be unable to care for a child or children and who is likely to procreate a child or children who probably would have serious physical, mental or nervous diseases or deficiencies, the classification under this statute (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html#t35a07s35-36" target="_blank">G.S. 35-36</a></cite>) is reasonable. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislative classification of mentally retarded persons is neither arbitrary nor capricious, but rests upon respectable medical knowledge and opinion that such persons are in fact different from the general population and may rationally be accorded different treatment for their benefit and the benefit of the public.

        Article Not Unconstitutionally Vague or Arbitrary.
   
   - This section (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html#t35a07s35-36" target="_blank">G.S. 35-36</a></cite>) and former G.S. 35-37 through 35-50, inclusive, provide a sufficient judicial standard and are not unconstitutionally vague or arbitrary.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Not a Violation of Equal Protection.
   
   - Since the North Carolina law applies equally to all those named, this section (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html#t35a07s35-36" target="_blank">G.S. 35-36</a></cite>) and former G.S. 35-37 through 35-50, inclusive, do not violate the equal protection clauses of the United States or North Carolina Constitutions. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html#t35a07s35-36" target="_blank">G.S. 35-36</a></cite>) and former G.S. 35-37 do not violate the equal protection clauses of the United States or North Carolina Constitutions since they provide for the sterilization of all mentally ill or retarded persons inside or outside an institution who meet the requirements of these statutes. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislative dual purpose - to prevent the birth of a defective child or the birth of a nondefective child that cannot be cared for by its parent - reflects a compelling state interest, and the classification rests upon a difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation and does not, therefore, violate the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. North Carolina Ass'n for Retarded Children v. North Carolina, 420 F. Supp. 451 (M.D.N.C. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Compelling State Interest Involved.
   
   - State interests in the sterilization of mentally ill or retarded persons rise to the level of a compelling state interest. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        All mentally retarded persons are sufficiently different from the general population to justify classification for some purposes without meeting the compelling governmental interest test. But the right to procreate is a fundamental one and under equal protection challenge sterilization cannot be ordered short of demonstrating a compelling governmental interest. This Article (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35</a></cite>, Article 7) is narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interest of preventing the birth of a defective child or the birth of a nondefective child that cannot be cared for by its parent, and so viewed, the state's interest rises to the dignity of a compelling one. North Carolina Ass'n for Retarded Children v. North Carolina, 420 F. Supp. 451 (M.D.N.C. 1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Valid Exercise of Police Power.
   
   - The sterilization of mentally ill or retarded persons under the safeguards set out in this Article (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35</a></cite>, Article 7) is a valid and reasonable exercise of the police power. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Not Cruel and Unusual Punishment.
   
   - The contention that sterilization amounts to cruel and unusual punishment is without basis in law since the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Constitution refers to those persons convicted of a crime, and sterilization under this section (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html#t35a07s35-36" target="_blank">G.S. 35-36</a></cite>) is not a criminal proceeding. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Application of Statute by Courts.
   
   - Though the sterilization statutes have been determined to meet the tests of constitutionality, the absence of standards and statutory definitions requires that the courts construe and apply the statutory provisions to the evidence in each case so as to adequately protect the respondent's fundamental rights. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 263 S.E.2d 805, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 373</cite>, 267 S.E.2d 686 (1980).

        The object of this Article
   
   (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35</a></cite>, Article 7) is to prevent the procreation of children by a mentally ill or retarded individual who, because of physical, mental or nervous disease or deficiency which is not likely to materially improve, would probably be unable to care for a child or children and who would likely, unless sterilized, procreate a child or children who probably would have serious physical, mental or nervous diseases or deficiencies.

        Concerns of State in Authorizing Sterilization.
   
   - The welfare of the parent and the future life and health of the unborn child are the chief concerns of the State in authorizing sterilization of individuals under certain circumstances. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to procreate is not absolute
   
   but is vulnerable to a certain degree of state regulation. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The welfare of all citizens should take precedence
   
   over the rights of individuals to procreate. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).

        Right to Prevent Procreation of Children Who Will Become State Burden.

         Former G.S. 35-39 Neither Overbroad Nor Vague.
        </b>
        - This section (former G.S. 35-39) is not overly broad. Although it permits initiation of the sterilization procedure against any and all members of the class, it does not contemplate that all members of the class will be sterilized. Nor is the standard of selection so vague that it cannot be comprehended and applied. North Carolina Ass'n for Retarded Children v. North Carolina, 420 F. Supp. 451 (M.D.N.C. 1976).

        <b>
         The legislative classification is itself narrowed as to impact
        </b>
        so that only mentally retarded persons who are sexually active, and unwilling or incapable of controlling procreation by other contraceptive means, and who are found to be likely to procreate a defective child, or who would be unable because of the degree of retardation to be able to care for a child, may be sterilized. North Carolina Ass'n for Retarded Children v. North Carolina, 420 F. Supp. 451 (M.D.N.C. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the standards governing mentally ill or retarded persons
   
   is to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted abridgment of the respondent's fundamental procreative rights while at the same time allowing the State to further its interests. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory phrase "care for a child" is not defined,
   
   but the courts in construing the phrase must find whether the evidence establishes a minimum standard of care consistent with both State interest and fundamental parental rights. The petitioner has the burden of proving at least probable inability to provide a reasonable domestic environment for the child. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings Required.
   
   - In each case the trial court must carefully review the living conditions of the respondent to determine the substantial likelihood that he or she will voluntarily, or otherwise, engage in sexual activity likely to cause impregnation. This will necessarily include an inquiry into the respondent's home environment, daily schedule, social activities, and the degree of supervision entailed in each aspect of this schedule. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of instituting sterilization proceedings under this section (former G.S. 35-39), a determination that a proposed sterilization is in the respondent's best interests must include a determination that the respondent is sexually active and that no temporary measure for birth control or contraception will adequately meet the respondent's needs, in addition to the statutory grounds regarding defective offspring and parental unfitness. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983), modified and aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before a sterilization can be ordered there must be a showing that the subject be shown to be likely to engage in sexual activity without utilizing contraceptive devices and is, therefore, likely to become impregnated. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983), modified and aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the district court judge may enter an order requiring that the operation be performed, he must make the findings of fact required by this section, which amounts to a judicial determination that the allegations contained in the petition are true. North Carolina Ass'n for Retarded Children v. North Carolina, 420 F. Supp. 451 (M.D.N.C. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section (former G.S. 35-43) means that the judge must find that the subject is likely to engage in sexual activity without utilizing contraceptive devices and is therefore likely to impregnate or become impregnated. North Carolina Ass'n for Retarded Children v. North Carolina, 420 F. Supp. 451 (M.D.N.C. 1976), modified and aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court must consider and make findings relative to the possibility that the respondent will experience trauma or psychological damage if she becomes pregnant or gives birth, and, conversely, the possibility of trauma or psychological damage from the sterilization operation. The latter consideration, of course, would also be applicable to a male candidate for sterilization. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The petitioner must prove by clear, strong and convincing evidence that there is a substantial likelihood that respondent will voluntarily or otherwise engage in sexual activity likely to cause impregnation before the district court judge may enter an order and judgment authorizing a sterilization procedure. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).

        "Best Interest" Alone as Basis for Compulsory Sterilization.
   
   - Although subdivision (1) (of former G.S. 35-39) provides that social services shall petition for sterilization if it would be in the "best interests" of the mentally retarded individual, this language is not contained in former G.S. 35-43, the provision which specifically outlines the findings to be made by the trial judge. It is, therefore, doubtful whether compulsory sterilization can be ordered on the basis of undefined "best interests" alone in view of the fundamental interest at stake. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner must establish by clear, strong and convincing evidence
   
   that respondent is unable or unwilling to control procreation by alternative, less drastic contraceptive methods, including, but not limited to, supervision, education and training.

        This Article (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35</a></cite>, Article 7) does not define sterilization
   
   or indicate which medical procedure is to be used when a sterilization is ordered. This section (former G.S. 35-39) suggests the existence of various alternative means of sterilization. The statutes are otherwise silent as to the procedures to be used. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C.

       <p>
        Legislative Intent.
   
   - It is clear from the language of this section (former G.S. 35-43) that the General Assembly intended to provide the mentally ill and defective with sufficient safeguards to prevent misuse of this potentially dangerous procedure. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the standards governing mentally ill or retarded persons is to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted abridgment of the respondent's fundamental procreative rights while at the same time allowing the State to further its interests. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983), modified and aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
   <br />

       <p>
        Sterilization may not be ordered if there is a less drastic means available.
   
   In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute does not limit unfitness to mental retardation.
   
   The term "physical, mental or nervous disease or deficiency" includes qualities other than diminished intelligence, and the range of retardation can vary from mild to severe. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 263 S.E.2d 805, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 373</cite>, 267 S.E.2d 686 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A presumption of unfitness founded solely on retardation is unwarranted.
   
   In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 263 S.E.2d 805, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 373</cite>, 267 S.E.2d 686 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Emergency Situations.
   
   - Under former G.S. 35-49, in life-threatening or emergency situations where sterilization is medically necessary, a petition could be granted absent a showing of the factors required by this section. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden on the petitioner to show personality defects
   
   or traits of unfitness apart from retardation increases as the retardation ranges from severe to mild. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 263 S.E.2d 805, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 373</cite>, 267 S.E.2d 686 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inability to Provide Child a Reasonable Environment Must Be Shown.
   
   - The petitioner has the burden of proving at least probable inability to provide a reasonable domestic environment for the child. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 263 S.E.2d 805, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 373</cite>, 267 S.E.2d 686 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence Must Establish Compelling State Interest.
   
   - The absence of statutory guidance for determining what constitutes proper care of a child and a person's inability to provide that care places on the courts the burden of requiring that the evidence establishes conclusively a compelling state interest before the fundamental right of procreation can be infringed. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 263 S.E.2d 805, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 373</cite>, 267 S.E.2d 686 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Relevant Evidence.
   
   - In an involuntary sterilization proceeding based on the ground that respondent because of mental deficiency would probably be unfit to care for a child, evidence concerning respondent's morals, sexual activity, and attitude toward birth control and her statements to a psychiatrist that in her youth she would get impatient and angry with children left in her care by her parents were relevant on the issues of fitness and care and whether respondent's condition was likely to improve materially. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 263 S.E.2d 822 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no statutory or constitutional authority for considering menstrual problems
   
   with respect to involuntary sterilization. The State's compelling interest is in the prevention of conception, not in the problems respondent's menstruation may pose for her, and certainly not in the problem it poses for her caretaker. Rather, the inquiry must focus on which method or surgical procedure for sterilization poses the least health risk and the least intrusion into respondent's bodily integrity. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No constitutional mandate requires the State to obtain a medical expert
   
   on behalf of an indigent respondent. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of cross-examination is specifically provided
   
   by this section (former G.S. 35-43). In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Only Requirement Is Written Objection to Sterilization.
   
   - In order to assure the right of cross-examination under this section (former G.S. 35-43), the only requirement is that the respondent, his guardian, attorney or other interested party object in writing to the sterilization. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Such Requirement Is Not Unduly Burdensome.
   
   - Since respondent is represented at every stage of the proceeding, the requirement that respondent, his guardian, attorney or other interested party object in writing to the sterilization is not unduly burdensome. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden and Standard of Proof.
   
   - Although this section (former G.S. 35-43) does not specify the burden of proof that the petitioner must meet before the order authorizing the sterilization can be entered, in keeping with the intent of the General Assembly that the rights of the individual must be fully protected, the evidence must be clear, strong and convincing before such an order may be entered. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section (former G.S. 35-43) means that before an order of sterilization can be entered, there must be findings from evidence that is clear, strong and convincing that the subject is likely to engage in sexual activity without using contraceptive devices and that either a defective child is likely to be born or a child born that cannot be cared for by its parent. North Carolina Ass'n for Retarded Children v. North Carolina, 420 F. Supp. 451 (M.D.N.C. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The petitioner must establish by clear, strong and convincing evidence that respondent is unable or unwilling to control procreation by alternative, less drastic contraceptive methods, including, but not limited to, supervision, education and training. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 304 S.E.2d 793 (1983), modified and aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The petitioner who seeks sterilization pursuant to this section (former G.S. 35-43) must satisfy the standards listed by the Court of Appeals in its opinion in North Carolina Ass'n for Retarded Children v. North Carolina, 420 F. Supp. 451 (M.D.N.C. 1976). In addition, the trial judge, in his discretion, may consider certain other factors that he considers to be reflective of the best interests of the respondent in any particular circumstance. In re Truesdell, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 421</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 630 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction on Standard of Proof.
   
   - Where the judge in his charge in effect equated proof by clear, strong and convincing evidence and proof by the greater weight of the evidence, the instruction was error. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 243 S.E.2d 386 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The judge should not attempt to define the term "clear, strong and convincing" in his charge. Whether the evidence is clear, strong and convincing is for the jury to resolve. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 243 S.E.2d 386 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prejudicial Comment on Effect of Sterilization Laws.
   
   - An explanation by the judge in his charge of the necessity and effect of laws authorizing sterilization could only result in prejudice to the respondent. It is very likely that it led the jury to believe that the judge felt it should answer the issue in favor of petitioner. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 243 S.E.2d 386 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prejudicial Comment on Procreation of Mentally Defective Child.
   
   - Where there was no allegation and no evidence to support a finding on the second ground, the likelihood of procreating a mentally defective child, but the judge, nevertheless, repeatedly gave instructions on that part of the statute and included in his final mandate an instruction that the jury answer the issue in favor of petitioner if it found that respondent would be likely, unless sterilized, to procreate a child who would probably have serious mental, physical, or nervous disease or deficiency, the instruction was erroneous and prejudicial to respondent. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 243 S.E.2d 386 (1978).

       Guardian Is Under Fiduciary Obligation to Manage Estate Reasonably and Prudently.
   
   - The guardian is always under a fiduciary obligation to manage the estate reasonably, prudently, and in the ward's best interest, and in all cases, the guardian's management of the estate will eventually be subject to judicial scrutiny. Cline v. Teich, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 374 S.E.2d 462 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian Must Preserve Estate and Enforce Ward's Rights.
   
   - It is the duty of the guardian to preserve the estate of the ward and to take practicable action to enforce the ward's rights against others. Kuykendall v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 510</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 293 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian Must Diligently Collect Obligation Owing Ward.
   
   - It is the duty of a guardian of the estate of an incompetent person to exercise due diligence in the collection of an obligation owing to the ward. The guardian is liable to the ward's estate for any loss to it by his failure to do so. Kuykendall v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 510</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 293 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Including Damages for Wrongs Done Ward.
   
   - It is the duty of the guardian of the estate of an incompetent to collect, insofar as practicable, all moneys due the ward, including damages for wrongs done to the ward which are known to the guardian. Kuykendall v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 510</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 293 (1967); State ex rel. Duckett v. Pettee, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 273 S.E.2d 317 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian Is Liable for All He Ought to Have Received.
   
   - A guardian is liable for what he ought to receive, as well as for what he does receive; and if he ought to receive a certain amount of money and does not, but takes something else, his own bond for instance, in the place of money, he and his sureties are liable. State ex rel. Avent v. Womack, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 397</cite> (1875).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a guardian carelessly and without deliberation accepts for his wards from an insolvent debtor an amount less than they are entitled to receive from a fund, he is liable to the wards for what he failed to collect. Culp v. Stanford, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 664</cite>, 16 S.E. 761 (1893), distinguishing Luton v. Wilcox, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 20</cite> (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       A guardian is liable not only for what he receives, but for all he ought to have received of his ward's estate. Kuykendall v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 510</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 293 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       By Exercise of Diligence and Good Faith.
   
   - A guardian is responsible, not only for what he receives, but for all he might have received by the exercise of ordinary diligence and the highest degree of good faith. State ex rel. Armfield v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 81</cite> (1875).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian Need Not Resort to Extraordinary Remedies.
   
   - Guardians are not responsible for losses to their wards attributable to their not having resorted to new and extraordinary remedies, the force and effect of which are doubtful. White v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 698</cite> (1870).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A guardian in managing his ward's estate must act in good faith
   
   and with that care and judgment that a man of ordinary prudence exercises in his own affairs. Luton v. Wilcox, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 20</cite> (1880).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian Is Empowered to Make Expenditures Without Prior Court Approval Except When Property Mortgaged or Sold.
   
   - In most cases, a guardian is empowered under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> to make expenditures from an incompetent ward's estate without prior court approval; prior approval of expenditures is necessary only when the incompetent's property is to be mortgaged or sold, or when the expenditures will be made from estate principal. Cline v. Teich, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 374 S.E.2d 462 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Accepting Unsecured Note.
   
   - A guardian who accepts an unsecured note in payment of a debt due his ward is guilty of laches, and is liable to his ward for the amount of such note. Covington v. Leak, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 594</cite> (1871).
   <br />
      </p>

       Failure to Sue before Insolvency of Debtor.
   
   - Where a guardian waited six months after the principal in a note held by him as guardian died insolvent before he sued the surety, who also became insolvent before the suit was brought, the guardian having an opportunity all the time of knowing the true condition of the obligors, it was held that by his laches he made himself responsible for the loss of the debt. Williamson v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. 62</cite> (1860), distinguishing Deberry v. Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 370</cite> (1856); Davis v.

       Failure to Collect Note during Civil War.
   
   - A guardian, who acted in good faith and was not guilty of culpable negligence, was held not to be responsible for omitting to collect a note during the Civil War, when it appeared that both of the two obligors were solvent during the war, and were made insolvent by its results. Love v. Logan, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. 70</cite> (1873).

       Payment of funds to guardian under War Risk Insurance Act
   
   vests title in the ward and operates to discharge the obligation of the United States.

       Guardian Not Authorized To Continue Action.
   
   - Trial court erred in denying the collector of an estate partial summary judgment and in granting beneficiaries, a trustee, and a limited liability company (LLC) partial summary judgment in the collector's action challenging the formation of the LLC and a trust because at the time the trial court entered its order denying the guardian of the estate summary judgment, the guardian was no longer authorized by statute to continue the action; pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C.

       Guardian Must Preserve Estate and Enforce Ward's Rights.
   
   - It is the duty of the guardian to preserve the estate of the ward and to take practicable action to enforce the ward's rights against others. Kuykendall v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 510</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 293 (1967).

      <p>
       Guardian Must Diligently Collect Obligation Owing Ward.
   
   - It is the duty of a guardian of the estate of an incompetent person to exercise due diligence in the collection of an obligation owing to the ward. The guardian is liable to the ward's estate for any loss to it by his failure to do so. Kuykendall v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 510</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 293 (1967).

       Including Damages for Wrongs Done Ward.
   
   - It is the duty of the guardian of the estate of an incompetent to collect, insofar as practicable, all moneys due the ward, including damages for wrongs done to the ward which are known to the guardian. Kuykendall v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 510</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 293 (1967); State ex rel. Duckett v. Pettee, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 273 S.E.2d 317 (1980).

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian Is Liable for All He Ought to Have Received.
   
   - A guardian is liable for what he ought to receive, as well as for what he does receive; and if he ought to receive a certain amount of money and does not, but takes something else, his own bond for instance, in the place of money, he and his sureties are liable. State ex rel. Avent v. Womack, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 397</cite> (1875).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a guardian carelessly and without deliberation accepts for his wards from an insolvent debtor an amount less than they are entitled to receive from a fund, he is liable to the wards for what he failed to collect.

       A guardian in managing his ward's estate must act in good faith
   
   and with that care and judgment that a man of ordinary prudence exercises in his own affairs. Luton v. Wilcox, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 20</cite> (1880).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Accepting Unsecured Note.
   
   - A guardian who accepts an unsecured note in payment of a debt due his ward is guilty of laches, and is liable to his ward for the amount of such note. Covington v. Leak, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 594</cite> (1871).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a guardian accepts from an administrator a smaller sum than the wards' share
   
   in the estate, the wards may, at their option, sue the guardian or the administrator for the deficiency. Alexander v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 472</cite>, 27 S.E. 121 (1897).

       Failure to Sue before Insolvency of Debtor.
   
   - Where a guardian waited six months after the principal in a note held by him as guardian died insolvent before he sued the surety, who also became insolvent before the suit was brought, the guardian having an opportunity all the time of knowing the true condition of the obligors, it was held that by his laches he made himself responsible for the loss of the debt. Williamson v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. 62</cite> (1860), distinguishing Deberry v. Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 370</cite> (1856); Davis v. Marcum, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. 189</cite> (1858).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a guardian negligently fails to sue on note due his ward's estate until the parties thereto are insolvent, he is liable for his negligence. Coggins v. Flythe, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 102</cite>, 18 S.E. 96 (1893).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Collect Note during Civil War.
   
   - A guardian, who acted in good faith and was not guilty of culpable negligence, was held not to the responsible for omitting to collect a note during the Civil War, when it appeared that both of the two obligors were solvent during the war, and were made insolvent by its results. Love v. Logan, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. 70</cite> (1873).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The guardian can select the forum,
   
   under former section, as there is no statute to the contrary. Lawson v. Langley, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 526</cite>, 191 S.E. 229 (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a guardian sued a physician for personal injuries to the guardian's minor ward, it was error to grant the physician's motion for a change of venue as of right based on a finding that suit was brought in the wrong county because the complaint's caption and prayer both stated suit was brought by the guardian in the guardian's capacity as guardian of the ward's estate, and, when the guardian had brought suit in the guardian's capacity as the ward's guardian ad litem, the guardian had so indicated in the complaint's caption, so suit was brought pursuant to the guardian's authority in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35AsIIa09s35A-1252" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1252(3)</a></cite>, and the guardian properly brought the suit in the county of the guardian's residence.

       Payment of funds to guardian under War Risk Insurance Act
   
   vests title in the ward and operates to discharge the obligation of the United States. Hence, the deposit of the funds in a bank duly appointed guardian, and which later became insolvent, does not entitle the surety on the guardianship bond to a preference for the amount of the deposit.

       Settlement of Ward's Partnership Interest upon Incorporation.

       § 35A-1253. Specific duties of guardian of estate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to any other duties imposed by law or by order of the clerk, a general guardian or guardian of the estate shall have the following specific duties:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t35AsIIa09s35A-1253ol11">
       To take possession, for the ward's use, of all his estate.
      </li>
      <li id="t35AsIIa09s35A-1253ol12">
       To diligently endeavor to collect, by all lawful means, all bonds, notes, obligations, or moneys due his ward.
      </li>
      <li id="t35AsIIa09s35A-1253ol13">
       To pay income taxes, property taxes, or other taxes or assessments owed by the ward, out of the ward's estate, as required by law. If any guardian allows his ward's lands to be sold for nonpayment of taxes or assessments, he shall be liable to his ward for the full value thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t35AsIIa09s35A-1253ol14">
       To observe the standard of judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that an ordinarily prudent person of discretion and intelligence, who is a fiduciary of the property of others, would observe as such fiduciary in acquiring, investing, reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing the ward's property. If the guardian has special skills or is named as guardian on the basis of representations of special skills or expertise, to use those skills.
      </li>
      <li id="t35AsIIa09s35A-1253ol15">
       To obey all lawful orders of the court pertaining to the guardianship and to comply with the accounting requirements of this Subchapter.

If after due service of the order, the guardian does not, within the time specified in the order, file such inventory or account, or obtain further time to file the same, the clerk may remove him from office, hold him in civil contempt as provided in Article 2 of Chapter 5A, or both.

      </p>
      <p>
       Definition of "Account".
   
   - An "account" is used in former section in the sense of a statement in writing of debits and credits, or of receipts and payments. And when not only an account, but payment or settlement is intended, additional words are used to express that idea. State v. Dunn, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 663</cite>, 46 S.E. 949 (1904).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Ward Can Demand Annual Statement.
   
   - A ward is entitled to demand of her guardian an annual statement of the manner and nature of his investments of her estate. Moore v. Askew, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 199</cite> (1881).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What to Be Set Out.
   
   - It is the duty of a guardian in making his annual returns to set out the manner in which he has invested the ward's estate, and the nature of the securities which he holds as guardian. State ex rel. Collins v. Gooch, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 186</cite>, 1 S.E. 653 (1887).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The annual account of a guardian is competent evidence
   
   against him, and presumptive evidence against his sureties. Loftin v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 58</cite>, 35 S.E. 230 (1900).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Of Good Faith.
   
   - No higher evidence can be offered of that good faith required of a guardian than perfect candor, full information, and minute, detailed accounts. Moore v. Askew, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 199</cite> (1881).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Settlement Is Prima Facie Correct When Accepted by the Court.
   
   - The ex parte settlement made by a guardian with the court having jurisdiction of such matters, is, when accepted by the court, prima facie correct, and while not conclusive upon creditors or next of kin, and strict proof and specific assignment of errors are not required as in actions to surcharge a stated account, nevertheless the burden is on the party attacking such settlement to establish, by a preponderance of testimony, its incorrectness. State ex rel. Turner v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 566</cite>, 10 S.E. 606 (1889).

Upon return of the order, duly served, if the guardian fails to appear or refuses to exhibit such account, the clerk may issue an attachment against him for contempt and commit him until he exhibits such account, and may likewise remove him from office. In all proceedings hereunder the defaulting guardian will be liable personally for the costs of the said proceedings, including the costs of service of all notices or writs incidental to, or thereby acquiring, and also including reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by a successor guardian or other person in bringing any such proceeding, or other proceedings deemed reasonable and necessary to discover or obtain possession of assets of the ward in the possession of the defaulting guardian or which the defaulting guardian should have discovered or which the defaulting guardian should have turned over to the successor guardian. The amount of the costs and attorney fees and expenses of such proceeding may be deducted from any commissions which may be found due said guardian on settlement of the estate.

      <p>
       Former section is not intended to bestow upon the guardian the ward's moneys and properties
   
   for six months (now 60 days) after he becomes of age, nor to deprive him of the right to bring an action to recover them during the period, but simply means that the guardian is presumed to have settled with his ward within such six months (now 60 days), and after its lapse the clerk can call on the guardian to file his final account, with the receipts of the ward, in full settlement, to complete the record in his office, for the section states that such return shall be "audited and recorded." Self v. Shugart, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 185</cite>, 47 S.E. 484 (1904).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction.
   
   - The clerk of the superior court has jurisdiction of settlements between guardian and ward, and, of course, between the guardian and the ward's personal representative. McNeill v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 52</cite>, 11 S.E. 265 (1890); McLean v. Breece, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 390</cite>, 18 S.E. 694 (1893).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Audit" Construed.
   
   - When the former section directs that the clerk shall "audit" the account, it implies that he shall pursue the usual course which has been found to be just and convenient in such cases. Rowland v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 714</cite> (1870).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Action Barred 10 Years after Ward Comes of Age.
   
   - Ten years after the ward comes of age bars an action by him against his guardian for settlement. Dunn v. Beaman, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 766</cite>, 36 S.E. 172, petition to rehear dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 578</cite>, 38 S.E. 1006 (1900).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Action Barred as to Sureties.
   
   - An action for breach of the guardianship bond based upon former section is barred as to the sureties after three years from the date the guardian should have made payment, and the fact that the guardian continued to pay the ward interest on the amount due the ward for several years after the ward's majority does not affect the running of the statute as to the sureties. State ex rel. Finn v. Fountain, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 217</cite>, 171 S.E. 85 (1933). See Copley v. Scarlett, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 31</cite>, 197 S.E. 623 (1938).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment Is an Estoppel.
   
   - The clerk of the superior court, having jurisdiction of proceedings against a guardian for a settlement, a judgment rendered therein is an estoppel to an action in the superior court between the same parties and upon the same question, and cannot be attacked collaterally, but can be impeached for fraud only by a direct proceeding for that purpose. Donnelly v. Wilcox, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 408</cite>, 18 S.E. 339 (1893).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Distributees May Have Accounting.
   
   - The express trust existing between the guardian and ward terminates at death of the latter, and the ward's distributees may have letters of administration taken out and call for an accounting. Lowder v. Hathcock, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 438</cite>, 64 S.E. 194 (1909).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Wrongful Settlement.
   
   - Where a guardian surrendered his office in March to one whom he supposed to be his legal successor and made a settlement with him, though he was not regularly appointed guardian until December following, but in the meantime acted as such in good faith, it was held that the management of the fund from March to December must be treated as an exercise of an agency of the former guardian, whose bond is responsible for any loss resulting therefrom. Jennings v. Copeland, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 572</cite> (1884).

     <p>
      Every guardian may charge in his annual account all reasonable disbursements and expenses; and if it appear that he has really and bona fide disbursed more in one year than the profits of the ward's estate, for his education and maintenance, the guardian shall be allowed and paid for the same out of the profits of the estate in any other year; but such disbursements must, in all cases, be suitable to the degree and circumstances of the estate of the ward.

      <p>
       A guardian should be charged with what he receives and credited with what he pays out,
   
   when it does not appear that he collected anything prematurely or kept on hand any unreasonable sum. Freeman v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 368</cite> (1876).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Credit for Paying Debts Due.
   
   - When the guardian in good faith pays debts that ought to be paid, and by so doing the ward's estate suffers no prejudice, he will be allowed credit for disbursements of assets in his hands in such respects. Adams v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 521</cite> (1880); McLean v. Breece, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 390</cite>, 18 S.E. 694 (1893).

      <p>
       Disbursement Where Ward Deceased and Only Child Is of Age.
   
   - Where, in the settlement of the guardian's account, the ward is dead and his only child is of age, and it appears that the guardian, in good faith, paid debts without prejudice to the estate, the disbursement would be allowed. McLean v. Breece, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 390</cite>, 18 S.E. 694 (1893).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Exceeding Income of Estate.
   
   - In paying the accounts of a guardian, he cannot, except under rare circumstances, be allowed disbursements beyond the income of his ward. Caffey v. McMichael, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 507</cite> (1870); Johnston v. Haynes, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. 514</cite> (1873).

       A guardian will not be permitted to use more than the accruing profits of his ward's estate in the maintenance and education of the ward, except with the sanction of the court, or in extreme cases of urgent necessity.

      <p>
       Exceeding Income of Estate - Clerk May Allow Credit.
   
   - The clerk of the superior court may allow a guardian credit for money necessarily expended in the education of the ward, though the amount exceeded the income and was made without the permission of the clerk. Duffy v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 195</cite>, 45 S.E. 548 (1903).

      <p>
       Father May Not Charge for Child's Maintenance without Court Approval.
   
   - A father, though he be the guardian of his minor child's estate, is not ordinarily permitted to charge for its maintenance, and, if able, he is himself bound to maintain his child; if not so, he must, before applying any of his ward's income to that end, procure the sanction of the proper court. Burke v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 500</cite> (1881).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       May Not Charge for Board and Other Necessaries.
   
   - Where a stepfather becomes guardian to his stepchild, he is not entitled to charge for board and other necessaries furnished to his ward antecedently to his appointment as guardian; the infant being incompetent to contract therefor.

      <p>
       Payments to Mother for Board of Wards after Majority.
   
   - A guardian is not chargeable with moneys paid to the mother of his wards for their board after their arrival at full age, no objection being urged against the propriety or justness of the claim, or of the price paid. McNeill v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 504</cite> (1880).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel Fees.
   
   - Fees paid by a guardian to the counsel for services rendered in obtaining an unfair settlement with the ward, and in aiding the guardian to cover up the fraud, cannot be allowed the latter in his settlement. Johnston v. Haynes, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. 509</cite> (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       A guardian should be allowed reasonable attorneys' fees paid in good faith. Burke v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 500</cite> (1881).
      </p>
      <p>
       The employment of counsel for legal advice and assistance in connection with the administration of the wards' estate is a proper expense to be charged in the guardian's account, if in reasonable amount, and for the benefit of the wards. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Lawing, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 103</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 609 (1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the interests of the guardian and wards are antagonistic and the services rendered by the attorney are in the interest of the former rather than the latter the obligation to pay therefor is the individual liability of the guardian.

Nothing herein contained shall be construed to abridge the inherent right of the clerk to require the production of securities, should he desire to do so.

      <p>
       Commissions are only a compensation to the guardian
   
   for his time and trouble in managing his ward's estate. Walton v. Erwin, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. 136</cite> (1840).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       And the time spent in the management of his ward's estate may be considered

      <p>
       Guardian is entitled to commissions, although he omitted to keep and render regular accounts,

Rose v. Bank of Wadesboro, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 600</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 2 (1940).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Using Ward's Money in Own Business.
   
   - A guardian will be allowed commissions, although he uses his ward's money in his business, if he makes regular returns, so as to show at all times what amount is due his ward. Carr v. Askew, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 194</cite> (1886), distinguishing Burke v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 500</cite> (1881). See Fisher v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 198</cite>, 47 S.E. 398 (1904).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Using Ward's Money in Own Business - Gross Negligence.
   
   - A guardian is not entitled to commissions on money collected and used by him in his own business where he was guilty of gross negligence in not making his returns. Burke v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 500</cite> (1881).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Rate of Commission.
   
   - Reasonable commissions will always be allowed to a guardian unless in cases of fraud or very culpable negligence. The rate will depend upon a variety of circumstances, such as the amount of the estate, the trouble in managing it, whether fees have been paid to counsel for assisting him in the management, the last of which will lessen it. Whitford v. Foy, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 265</cite> (1871).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Rate of Commission - Two and One-Half Percent.
   
   - Two and one-half percent was ample commission to a guardian receiving most of the ward's property, without litigation or difficulty, in the shape of notes payable to himself, which he retained six years collecting but little interest, when he voluntarily resigned and delivered the notes to his successor. Walton v. Erwin, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. 136</cite> (1840).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Rate of Commission - Five Percent.
   
   - Five percent was not an unreasonable allowance to a guardian as commissions on his receipts and disbursements, when these were numerous, and extended over a period of 14 years. Covington v. Leak, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 594</cite> (1871).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission of the highest percentage allowed by statute,
   
   will be allowed to a guardian only in a case of the greatest merit, as where his duties have been troublesome and of long continuance. Walton v. Erwin, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. 136</cite> (1840).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Referee's Decision Usually Adopted.
   
   - The amount of allowance of commissions to a guardian by a referee is usually adopted by the court, unless it is shown to be excessive. Johnston v. Haynes, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. 514</cite> (1873); Whitford v. Foy, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 527</cite> (1874).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate Review of Referee's Finding.
   
   - An appellate court will not review the finding of a referee as to the commissions allowed a guardian, unless such commissions are shown to be grossly erroneous. Whitford v. Foy, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 527</cite> (1874).
   <br />

       When Local Guardian Not Necessary.
   
   - Where a foreign guardian has been duly appointed in the state of his own residence and that of his wards, and has filed a certified copy of his appointment, with a bond sufficient both as to the amount and the financial ability of the sureties to protect the estate of his wards and in conformity with former G.S. 33-48 and former G.S. 33-49, with his petition to the clerk of the court as required by these statutes, it is not necessary that a local guardian be appointed, but the court in this State, before which the matter is properly pending, may order that the foreign guardian be permitted to withdraw the estate of his wards to the place of foreign jurisdiction.

      </p>
      <p>
       When Guardian Must Be Resident.
   
   - Where the infant grandchildren of the testator take upon a contingency, as directed by the will, properly probated here, it is required that the guardian appointed be a resident of this State, according to our law, unless the funds have been properly removed to another state, under former G.S. 33-48 and former G.S. 33-49; and the law of this State governs the interpretation of the will when the testator died domiciled here. Cilley v. Geitner, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 714</cite>, 110 S.E. 61 (1921).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreign Guardian as Next Friend.
   
   - A guardian appointed in another state has no authority to represent his wards in suits and proceedings in this State, but when he brings suit for them as guardian it will be treated as if he were their next friend. Tate v. Mott, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. 19</cite>, 2 S.E. 176 (1887).
   <br />

      <p>
       Removal Held Properly Refused.
   
   - Where it appeared that the property in this State of a ward residing in another state consisted of good bonds at interest in the hands of his guardian here, a part of which arose from the sale of land, and the ward was nearly of age, and there was no special necessity made to appear for making a transfer of the property, the court of equity, in the exercise of its discretion, refused to order a transfer of the estate to the hands of a guardian appointed in such other state. Douglas v. Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. 20</cite> (1860).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A guardian in another state of nonresident wards may proceed to obtain possession of the property bequeathed to the wards
   
   and in the hands of an executor in this State under a will duly probated here under the provisions of former G.S. 33-48 and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.036A.html#t36Aa02s36A-13" target="_blank">G.S. 36A-13</a></cite>, relating to property in the hands of a trustee residing in this State, is not applicable.

      <p>
       The petition and proceeding prescribed by former G.S. 33-48 are jurisdictional,
   
   in order to authorize the transfer of the funds of an infant domiciled in this State to a guardian in another state; and an order, by the judge of the superior court or clerk, for its transfer otherwise is void.

      </p>
      <p>
       Testamentary guardian ought not to be removed without a showing of such waste, insolvency, or misconduct
   
   that the ward will be unable to recover the balance due on the final settlement. Sanderson v. Sanderson, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. 369</cite> (1878).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal Use of Ward's Funds.
   
   - The use by a guardian of the funds of his ward for his own use is sufficient to warrant his removal. Ury v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 270</cite>, 40 S.E. 4 (1901).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Showing Required for Removal of Legal Guardian.
   
   - A legal guardian of a child's person, unlike a mere custodian, is not removable for a mere change of circumstances; unfitness or neglect of duty must be shown. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 334 S.E.2d 428 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 194</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 584 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b)(7) authorizes the removal of a guardian where there is a showing of any potential for conflict between the interests of the ward and those of the guardian. In re Estate of Armfield, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 439 S.E.2d 216 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order changing the guardianship of a protected person was proper because both the clerk and the trial court applied the correct standard to the petition for removal of a guardian, and the appointment of a substitute guardian under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35AsIIa13s35A-1290ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1290(a)</a></cite>: the better care and maintenance of the ward. Thomas v. Birchard (In re Thomas), <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 480, 644 S.E.2d 608 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reversing an assistant clerk's order removing a guardian of an estate and trustee under a special needs trust for breach of fiduciary duty was error where the appropriate standard of review was whether the assistant clerk committed an error of law, the unchallenged findings of fact showed that the guardian and trustee had spent more than 90 percent of the monies that had been deposited in the trust for purposes for which he received some, if not all, of the benefit, and thus, he was removed based on waste and mismanagement of the assets committed to his care. In re Estate of Skinner, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 126</cite>, 804 S.E.2d 449 (2017).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The words "might tend" in subsection (b)(7)
   
   established a minimal showing of possible conflicting interest for the removal of a guardian. In re Estate of Armfield, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 439 S.E.2d 216 (1994).

   - Appeals under G.S. 1-276 [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27As1-301.1" target="_blank">G.S. 1-301.1</a></cite> et seq.] are confined to civil actions and special proceedings. The decisions are plenary that the removal of a guardian is neither. In re Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 702</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 231 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate Jurisdiction of Superior Court over Removals Is Derivative.
   
   - In the appointment and removal of guardians, the appellate jurisdiction of the superior court is derivative, and appeals present for review only errors of law committed by the clerk. In re Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 702</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 231 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A ward may not bring action in superior court by next friend to remove guardian
   
   appointed by the clerk, and for the appointment of another guardian, the superior court in such instance being without jurisdiction. Moses v. Moses, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 657</cite>, 169 S.E. 273 (1933).

      The clerk may remove a guardian without hearing if the clerk finds reasonable cause to believe that an emergency exists that threatens the physical well-being of the ward or constitutes a risk of substantial injury to the ward's estate. In all cases where the letters of a guardian are revoked, the clerk may, pending the resolution of any controversy in respect to such removal, make such interlocutory orders and decrees as the clerk finds necessary for the protection of the ward or the ward's estate or the other party seeking relief by such revocation.

         The cases cited below were decided under former law.
        </b>
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       The receiver does not have the powers of a guardian,
   
   but acts under the control of the court until another guardian is appointed. Temple v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 82</cite> (1884).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability of Receiver.
   
   - As a general rule, a receiver is responsible for his own neglect only, and is protected when he acts in entire good faith. State ex rel. Collins v. Gooch, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 186</cite>, 1 S.E. 653 (1887).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability of Receiver - Similar to Guardian's.
   
   - When a receiver is appointed to take charge of an infant's estate who has no guardian, and is directed to lend out the money and pay the income over to the ward, he will be held to the same accountability as a guardian. State ex rel. Collins v. Gooch, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 186</cite>, 1 S.E. 653 (1887).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability for Failure of Bank.
   
   - A receiver may keep money in a bank as a safe place of deposit, or may use the bank as a means of transmitting money to distant places, and if he uses reasonable diligence, he will not be held liable if the bank fails. State ex rel. Collins v. Gooch, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 186</cite>, 1 S.E. 653 (1887).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a receiver was appointed to take charge of an infant's estate and invest the same, and report to the court annually, and he deposited a portion of the money in a bank in another state to his credit as receiver, on which deposit he was paid interest by the bank, which afterwards failed, it was held that the receiver was liable for the loss, as he had failed to report to the court the manner in which he had invested the infant's estate, although he had acted in the best faith. State ex rel. Collins v. Gooch, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 186</cite>, 1 S.E. 653 (1887).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability on Official Bond of Clerk.
   
   - When the clerk of the superior court is appointed receiver of a minor's estate under this section, he takes and holds the funds by virtue of his office as clerk, and his sureties upon his official bond as such officer are liable for any failure of duty on his part in that respect. State ex rel. Boothe v. Upchurch, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 62</cite>, 14 S.E. 642 (1892). See State ex rel. Rogers v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 432</cite> (1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sureties on the clerk's official bond are liable for any breach of his duties as receiver. Waters v. Melson, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 89</cite>, 16 S.E. 918 (1893).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Action Against Receiver.
   
   - It is not necessary to obtain leave of the court before commencing an action for failure of the clerk to fulfill his duty when appointed receiver under former section. State ex rel. Boothe v. Upchurch, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 62</cite>, 14 S.E. 642 (1892).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Action Against Receiver - Burden of Proof.
   
   - The burden is upon a receiver and his sureties to show that he used due diligence in investing the money in his hands. Waters v. Melson, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 89</cite>, 16 S.E. 918 (1893).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Settlement Not Conclusive Against Ward.
   
   - A settlement made with a receiver appointed under former section, even if had under direction of the court, is not conclusive against the ward, but only raises a presumption that the account and settlement are correct. Such presumption may be disproved. Temple v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 82</cite> (1884).

       Guardian Not Authorized To Continue Action.
   
   - Trial court erred in denying the collector of an estate partial summary judgment and in granting beneficiaries, a trustee, and a limited liability company (LLC) partial summary judgment in the collector's action challenging the formation of the LLC and a trust because at the time the trial court entered its order denying the guardian of the estate summary judgment, the guardian was no longer authorized by statute to continue the action; pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 25(a), the trial court substituted the collector as plaintiff, and that order was entered after the trial court granted the beneficiaries, trustee, and LLC summary judgment. White v.

        Whenever used herein, the word "guardian" shall be construed to include general guardian, guardian of the estate, ancillary guardian, next friend, guardian ad litem, or commissioner of the court acting pursuant to this Article, but not a guardian who is guardian of the person only; and the word "mortgage" shall be construed to include deeds of trust.
       </li>
       <li id="t35AsIIIa14s35A-1301ol1b">
        A guardian may apply to the clerk, by verified petition setting forth the facts, to sell, mortgage, exchange, or lease for a term of more than three years, any part of his ward's real estate, and such proceeding shall be conducted as in other cases of special proceedings. The clerk, in his discretion, may direct that the next of kin or presumptive heirs of the ward be made parties to such proceeding. The clerk may order a sale, mortgage, exchange, or lease to be made by the guardian in such way and on such terms as may be most advantageous to the interest of the ward, upon finding by satisfactory proof that:

         Not Applicable to Settlement or Partition.

   <br />

        <p>
         Jurisdiction of Court.
   
   - The superior courts have authority in all proper cases to direct a sale of the property of infants, both real and personal, for their benefit and advantage. Williams v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. 616</cite> (1850); Ex parte Dodd, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. 97</cite> (1867); Sutton v. Schonwald, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 198</cite> (1882); Morris v. Gentry, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 248</cite> (1883); Tate v.

        </p>
        <p>
         Clerk and Court Have Concurrent Jurisdiction.
   
   - By former section the clerk and court in term have concurrent jurisdiction in the manner of ordering a sale of infants' lands upon petition of their guardian. Barcello v. Hapgood, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 712</cite>, 24 S.E. 124 (1896).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Clerk's Jurisdiction Is Statutory.
   
   - A clerk of the superior court has no jurisdiction with respect to infants or with respect to property, real or personal, of infants, except such as in conferred by statute. Wilson v. Pemberton, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 782</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 217 (1966).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Petition Signed by Person Not a Qualified Guardian Confers No Jurisdiction on Clerk.
   
   - A clerk of the superior court has jurisdiction to order the sale of a ward's lands only upon petition verified by the duly appointed and qualified guardian of the ward, and where such petition is filed and signed by a person purporting to act as guardian, but who had not been appointed guardian and had not qualified by filing bond, the petition confers no jurisdiction on the clerk. Buncombe County v. Cain, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 766</cite>, 188 S.E. 399 (1936).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Petition for Authority to Execute Deeds.
   
   - Trustee, while serving as the individual's guardian, could have petitioned the clerk for the authority to execute the deeds, but what the trustee could not was what she did here: sign deeds pursuant to a power of attorney that was executed well after the individual was adjudicated incompetent. O'Neal v. O'Neal, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 309, 803 S.E.2d 184, review denied, 804 S.E.2d 525, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 711 (N.C. 2017).
   <br />

        <p>
         Purchaser at Sale Acquires No Title Adverse to Infant.
   
   - A purchaser of an infant's property at a sale made under an order which is void because the clerk who made the order had no jurisdiction of the proceeding in which the order was made, acquires no right, title, interest, or estate in said property, adverse to the infant. Buncombe County v. Cain, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 766</cite>, 188 S.E. 399 (1936).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         When Prior Court Approval of Expenditures Required.
   
   - In most cases, a guardian is empowered under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> to make expenditures from an incompetent ward's estate without prior court approval; prior approval of expenditures is necessary only when the incompetent's property is to be mortgaged or sold, or when the expenditures will be made from estate principal. Cline v. Teich, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 374 S.E.2d 462 (1988).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Compliance with Statutory Requirements Presumed.
   
   - Although former section must be strictly complied with, where a guardian has applied for permission to mortgage her wards' land, and the clerk has entered an order therefor, which order has been approved by the court, there is a presumption that the statutory requirements have been met. Quick v. Federal Land Bank, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 562</cite>, 181 S.E. 746 (1935).
        </p>
        <p>
         The power of a guardian to make disposition of his ward's estate is very carefully regulated, and the sale is not allowed except by order of court, which order must have the supervision, approval and confirmation of the resident judge of the district or the judge regularly holding the courts of the district. Pike v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 1</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 453 (1968).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Proof Required.
   
   - Former section contemplates that, in addition to the verified petition of the guardian, there shall be required other satisfactory proof of the truth of the matter alleged. In re Propst, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 562</cite>, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 563</cite>, 57 S.E. 342 (1907).
        </p>
        <p>
         The "satisfactory proof" required under former section must be some proof in addition to the guardian's petition and must show the necessity for the proposed sale. In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 410</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 371 (1976).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Appraisal Value.
   
   - Guardian complied with the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35AsIIIa14s35A-1301ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1301(b)</a></cite> in the sale of the ward's properties because the guardian was not statutorily required to obtain an appraisal value nor did the superior court request such documentation prior to the approval of the sales. Further, the comparative market analysis used by the guardian in valuing the property was an acceptable method in North Carolina. Clay v. Monroe, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 658 S.E.2d 532 (2008).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Sale May Be Private.
   
   - The sale by order of the court may be either public or private. Former G.S. 33-21 does not apply when the sale is by order of court. Barcello v. Hapgood, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 712</cite>, 24 S.E. 124 (1896).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Title at Unauthorized Private Sale.
   
   - A guardian, having offered at public sale the land of his wards in accordance with an order of the court, and having failed to sell for want of a bid at a fair price, subsequently sold the land at private sale upon terms approved by the court. It was held that the purchaser at such private sale obtained a good title. Rowland v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 504</cite> (1875).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         The court may sell the land of minors for better investment,
   
   when they are properly represented before the court. Hutchinson v. Hutchinson, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 671</cite>, 36 S.E. 149 (1900).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         When Foreign Guardian May Sell.
   
   - Where a foreign guardian has complied with the provisions of former G.S. 33-48 and former G.S. 33-49 which authorize him to withdraw the estate of his wards to the place of their residence and to a court of foreign jurisdiction, he may, in the same proceedings, and incident thereto, have the real property of his wards sold and converted into money in conformity with the provisions of former section, when the wards are represented therein by their next friend, and it is made to appear that their interests will be promoted thereby, etc. Cilley v. Geitner, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 528</cite>, 111 S.E. 866 (1922).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         As to sale of contingent interests,
   
   see Smith v. Witter, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 616</cite>, 94 S.E. 402 (1917).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Guardian Cannot Purchase.
   
   - It is well settled that a guardian cannot purchase at his own sale, and that all such purchases may be treated as invalid, at the option of the wards, even when no unfairness in the sale and purchase has been shown. But this does not apply to a sale made by a master. Patton v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 285</cite> (1855); Lee v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. 200</cite> (1873).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         When Guardian Liable.
   
   - Where a guardian obtains a decree for the sale of his ward's land, it must appear, in order to make him liable for any loss in consequence of such sale, that he wilfully practiced a deception on the court by false allegations and false evidence, or by industriously concealing material facts. Harrison v. Bradley, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. 136</cite> (1847).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         No Liability on Implied Warranty of Authority.
   
   - A guardian who contracts to convey the property of his ward is not liable on an implied warranty of authority. Pike v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 1</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 453 (1968).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         A guardian may not be authorized to join with the life tenant in executing a mortgage on lands in which his wards own the remainder
   
   in order to refund notes executed by the life tenant representing a part of the moneys expended by the life tenant in making permanent improvements upon the land, since the remaindermen being in no way liable for the sums expended by the life tenant, the execution of the mortgage could not be to the interest of the remaindermen. Hall v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 805</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 273 (1941).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Mortgage Valid in Part.
   
   - Under the presumption that the provisions of former section were followed, mortgage executed by guardian was held valid as to funds used for permanent improvements on land, but void as to funds used to purchase livestock. Quick v. Federal Land Bank, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 562</cite>, 181 S.E. 746 (1935).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Court May Authorize Lease Extending Beyond Period of Minority.
   
   - Since the superior courts in proper instances have authority to order a sale of infants' real estate and to order and approve execution of a mortgage on same by the guardian for a period exceeding the minority of the wards, such statutory power, together with the inherent jurisdiction of courts of equity over the estates of infants, give courts of equity plenary jurisdiction to order and empower a guardian to execute a lease on the real estate belonging to his wards for a period exceeding the guardianship or the minority of the wards, upon its findings that such would be to the best interest of the infant wards. Coxe v. Charles Stores Co., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 380</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 848, 121 A.L.R. 959 (1939).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Confirmation of Sale.
   
   - While a formal direction to make title is not always necessary a confirmation of the sale cannot be dispensed with. In re Dickerson, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 108</cite>, 15 S.E. 1025 (1892).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Where an order confirming a sale of lands for partition does not provide for the disbursement of the funds,
   
   and the sum received in cash is properly paid into court and properly disbursed to the parties, the share of the minors therein being less than $100 and being paid to their mother for their benefit, under former G.S. 2-53 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIIa12s7A-111" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-111</a></cite>), the sale was not void. Ex parte Huffstetler, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 796</cite>, 167 S.E. 65 (1933).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Order of Sale Must Be Approved.
   
   - The power of a guardian to make disposition of his ward's real estate is very carefully regulated and a sale is not allowed except on petition filed, and the order must in all cases have the supervision and approval of the judge. Morton v. Pine Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 163</cite>, 100 S.E. 322 (1919).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Approval of Order by Emergency Judge.
   
   - An emergency judge has no power to approve and confirm an order of the clerk for the sale or mortgage of lands by a guardian when such emergency judge is not holding court in the county. Ipock v. North Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 791</cite>, 175 S.E. 127 (1934).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Approval of Order Nunc Pro Tunc.
   
   - Where a guardian executed a note and deed of trust under an order made by the clerk without the approval of the judge, and the judge later approved the order nunc pro tunc, the defect was cured so as to come within former section. Powell v. Armour Fertilizer Works, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 311</cite>, 170 S.E. 916 (1933); Ipock v. North Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 791</cite>, 175 S.E. 127 (1934).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         When Sale May Be Set Aside.
   
   - Where the court, without taking any means to ascertain the necessity for a sale, directed it to be made, and that it should be "first advertised at the courthouse and three other public places," and no bid be received less than $125, and that the guardian should make conveyance, it was held that it was not error to set aside the sale and direct another. In re Dickerson, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 108</cite>, 15 S.E. 1025 (1892).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Title Not Affected by Reversal of Decree.
   
   - Where land of an infant was sold under a decree of the court upon petition of a guardian, the title acquired is not rendered invalid by the reversal of the decree on account of irregularity in the proceeding of which the purchaser had no notice. Sutton v. Schonwald, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 198</cite> (1882).
   <br />

         Court should first ascertain that there are debts due from the ward,

         Sufficiency of Order.
   
   - An order authorizing a guardian, under certain circumstances, to sell the land of his ward, must first show that it was ascertained that there were debts due from the ward, and then specify what particular land is to be sold for their payment. Spruill v. Davenport, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. 42</cite> (1855).
   <br />

         Sufficient Specification of Land.
   
   - An order "to sell the land of the ward named in the petition, adjoining the lands of A, B, and others, containing about 110 acres," it not appearing that the ward had other land, was held a sufficient specification of the land under the statute. Pendleton v. Trueblood, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. 96</cite> (1855).
   <br />
        </p>
        <p>
         Insufficient Specification of Land.
   
   - An order that the guardian sell the land of his ward, or so much thereof as will be sufficient to discharge his debts, is fatally defective and void, and vests no title in those who bought at the sale. Leary v. Fletcher, <cite class="nc_code">23 N.C. 259</cite> (1840); Ducket v. Skinner, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. 431</cite> (1850).

         Sale Void Where Debts Not Shown.

   <br />
        </p>

The clerk to whom such application is made shall hear and pass upon the same and enter his findings and order as to whether said sale, mortgage, or exchange is necessary or would materially promote the ward's interest, and said order and findings shall be certified to the clerk of the county in which the ward's land, or some part of it, is located and before whom any petition or application is filed for the sale, mortgage, or exchange of said land. Such findings and orders so certified shall be considered by the court along with all other evidence and circumstances in passing upon the petition in which an order is sought for the sale, mortgage, or exchange of said land.

       <p>
        Proceeds of Sale of Land Retain Character of Real Estate.
   
   - When an undivided interest of an insane person in land was sold by his guardian under court order, the proceeds of sale retained the character of real estate for the purpose of devolution on his death intestate while still insane, and would go as his interest in the land would had it not been sold. Brown v. Cowper, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 1</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 305 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule is that where the real estate of an incompetent is sold under a statute or by order of court, the proceeds of sale remain realty for the purpose of devolution on his death intestate while still an incompetent. Grant v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 473</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 87 (1967), commented on in 46 N.C.L. Rev. 687 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Purchase Back of Identical Real Property Sold.
   
   - In view of the general rule as to the sale of an insane person's real property under a court order, and in view of this section, a conveyance of real property by the guardian of an insane person and the purchase back of the identical real property at a foreclosure sale by the use of unpaid purchase money notes would not break the line of descent. Brown v. Cowper, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 1</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 305 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exchange of Real Property for Real Property.
   
   - Former G.S. 33-32 does not in explicit words refer to the case where real property is substituted for real property. However, considering the general rule as to the sale of an insane person's real property under a court order, and the purpose and intent of former G.S. 33-32, an undivided interest in land conveyed to an insane person in exchange for his interest in other tracts of land transmitted to him by descent from his mother would, upon his death intestate and continuously insane since before the appointment of his guardian until his death, nothing else appearing, descend as by law his undivided interest in the other tracts would descend, if his undivided interest in the other tracts of land had not been sold, conveyed and exchanged. Brown v. Cowper, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 1</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 305 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Husband Who Received Proceeds Had No Right to Complain of Procedure.
   
   - It is the duty of the court, when the real estate of an infant is sold under its decree, to direct the proceeds to be held as real estate, yet the husband of such infant, who has received the proceeds from his wife's guardian, has no right to complain that such course has not been adopted. Harrison v. Bradley, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. 136</cite> (1847).

       <p>
        Where infant's land was sold for her benefit and she married and died before becoming of age,
   
   it was held that the money retained the character of real property. Wood v. Reeves, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. 271</cite> (1859).

       In case the land cannot be rented for enough to pay the taxes and other dues thereof, and there is not money sufficient for that purpose, the guardian, with the consent of the clerk, may annually dispose of or use so much of the lightwood, and box or rent so many pine trees, or sell so much of the timber on the same, as may raise enough to pay the taxes and other duties thereon, and no more.

       Every married person whose husband or wife is adjudged incompetent and is confined in a mental hospital or other institution in this State, and who was living with the incompetent spouse at the time of commitment shall, if he or she be in needy circumstances, have the right to bring a special proceeding before the clerk to sell the real property of the incompetent spouse, or so much thereof as is deemed expedient, and have the proceeds applied for support: Provided, that said proceeding shall be approved by the judge of the superior court holding the courts of the superior court district or set of districts as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIIa07s7A-41.1" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-41.1</a></cite> where the said property is situated.

       <p>
        The duty to provide support to a dependent spouse is a continuing obligation,
   
   fairly chargeable to the estate of an incompetent; therefore, incompetent's wife's complaint for support stated a legally recognized claim. Cline v. Teich, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 374 S.E.2d 462 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Clerk of Superior Court Has Power to Determine Whether Spouse Should Be Granted Support.
   
   - The clerk of superior court - after first ensuring that the estate is ample to meet the expenses of caring for the incompetent - has residual equitable power under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35A</a></cite> to examine the facts and circumstances of the case to determine whether the incompetent's spouse should be granted support from her husband's estate and the right to continue to live in his home; factors the clerk may consider include the size and condition of the estate, the present and future demands against it, and the spouse's needs. Cline v. Teich, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 374 S.E.2d 462 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court was not the proper forum
   
   in which to seek spousal support from the estate of an incompetent; the superior court is the only proper division to hear matters regarding the administration of incompetents' estates; therefore, the incompetent's spouse should have made her demand for support before the clerk of superior court either as a motion in the cause pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35AsIIa04s35A-1207" target="_self">G.S. 35A-1207</a></cite>, or as a special proceeding for the sale of her husband's property under this section.

       Home Purchased in Name of Incompetent for Use by Sister.
   
   - The evidence tended to show that petitioner was the sister of an insane veteran, that prior to and after entering the army he assisted in her support, that he was unmarried and had no other dependents, that his guardian had on hand more than enough to amply provide for his support, and that petitioner was destitute and without means of support. It was held that the clerk of the superior court, with the approval of the resident judge or presiding judge, had the power, upon proper findings from the evidence, to order guardian to purchase a home in the name of the incompetent for the use of petitioner, and to advance petitioner a reasonable sum monthly for her support.

       Evidence Showing Need and Proper Purpose for Advancements.
   
   - Where the impoverished condition of an incompetent's adult children and the adequacy of his estate were not challenged, and while the order for advancements did not restrict the use of the funds to the purchase of a home, the applicants had requested advancements for that purpose, it was held that the evidence demonstrated a need and a proper purpose for advancements, and was sufficient to support the findings and the judgment.

       Article Limits Power of Trustee or Guardian to Make Gifts.
   
   - Former Articles 5A, 5B, and 5C of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html" target="_blank">Chapter 35</a></cite> limit the power of a guardian or a trustee to make gifts of the character enumerated therein. He may do so only with the approval of the resident judge of the superior court of the county in which the guardian or trustee was appointed. To secure approval, the guardian or trustee must file a verified petition setting out what authority he wishes and the reasons justifying his request. In re Trusteeship of Kenan, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 627</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 547 (1964).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Income or Corpus of Incompetent's Estate Cannot Be Taken Except for His Support or Debts.
   
   - A court of equity may not, either in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction or with legislative sanction granted by former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035.html#t35a5As35-29.1" target="_blank">G.S. 35-29.1</a></cite>, 35-29.4, 35-29.5, 35-29.10, 35-29.11 and 35-29.16, authorize the taking of income or corpus of the estate of an incompetent for a purpose other than the incompetent's own support and the discharge of the incompetent's legal obligations. In re Trusteeship of Kenan, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 1</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 85 (1964).

      <p>
       Court May Not Authorize Gift Because It Believes Gift Should Be Made.
   
   - To authorize a gift from an incompetent's estate "if the court under all of the circumstances believes that such gift should be made," would permit the court to do that which the incompetent had not done and would not do if sane. Such an order would amount to a taking of property in derogation of incompetent's constitutional rights. In re Trusteeship of Kenan, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 1</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 85 (1964).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Proposed Act by Trustee Need Not Enhance Ward's Estate.
   
   - No court should authorize a guardian, or trustee, of an estate of an incompetent to act in a manner which will prove detrimental to the estate of his ward; but it does not follow that the proposed action must be one which benefits or enhances the estate of the ward. In re Trusteeship of Kenan, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 627</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 547 (1964).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Gifts of Income or Principal May Be Authorized.
   
   - While an incompetent's property may not, either with legislative sanction or court order, be taken for charitable purposes notwithstanding the part not taken is ample for incompetent's needs, it is nonetheless true that courts of equity have authorized the gift of a part of incompetent's income or principal. In re Trusteeship of Kenan, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 1</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 85 (1964).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       On Finding Incompetent Would Probably Have Made Gift if Sane.
   
   - A court may authorize a fiduciary to make a gift of a part of the estate of an incompetent only on a finding, on a preponderance of the evidence, at a hearing of which interested parties have notice, that the incompetent, if then of sound mind, would make the gift. In re Trusteeship of Kenan, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 1</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 85 (1964); In re Trusteeship of Kenan, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 627</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 547 (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       What it is necessary to establish is that the act proposed by the trustee of an incompetent is that which it is probable the incompetent would himself have done, or as it is probable he would have acted for himself, if he were of sound mind. In re Trusteeship of Kenan, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 627</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 547 (1964).

The incompetent's estate shall consist of all assets owned by the incompetent, including nonprobate assets.

       Section Requires Notice to Those Who May Benefit on Incompetent's Death.
   
   - Former G.S. 35-29.6 makes a condition precedent to the judge's approval "at least 10 days' written notice that approval for such gifts will be sought and that objection may be filed with the clerk of the superior court, of the county in which the guardian or trustee was appointed," to those named as legatees or devisees, if incompetent has executed a will, or to those who would be heirs and distributees if the incompetent died intestate contemporaneously with the filing of the petition.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Opportunity to Present Facts to Court.
   
   - Former G.S. 35-29.6 recognizes the contingent or potential interest of those who would probably benefit financially by the death of an incompetent; and, because of their interest, notice must be given to them. Those who must have notice are given an opportunity to present to the court facts which will assist the court in determining whether the action proposed by the trustee is detrimental to the estate of the incompetent, or whether the incompetent, if then competent, would probably not act as the trustee proposes to act.

      </p>
      <p>
       Beneficiaries Are Not Parties to Trustee's Proceeding.
   
   - Those named as beneficiaries in an incompetent's will have no interest in her properties so long as she lives. They take at her death only such properties as she then owns. They are not parties, and former G.S. 35-29.6 does not purport to make them parties, to a proceeding initiated by the trustee.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When a person has created a revocable trust, reserving the income for life, and thereafter has been judicially declared to be incompetent, the guardian or trustee of such incompetent, with the approval of the resident judge of the superior court of the district in which he was appointed, upon a duly verified petition may declare the trust to be irrevocable and make a gift of the life interest of the incompetent to the State of North Carolina, its agencies, counties or municipalities, or to the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities, or for religious, charitable, literary, scientific, historical, medical or educational purposes.

       Modification of Trust Does Not Rewrite Contract.
   
   - Modification of a trust by making it irrevocable and donating the income for the life of the incompetent trustor to certain designated charities does not rewrite the contract so as to affect the rights of the ultimate beneficiaries, but merely authorizes the trustees to do those things which the trustor, if competent, would probably have done.

       Section Requires Notice to Those Who May Benefit on Incompetent's Death.
   
   - Former G.S. 35-29.12 makes a condition precedent to the judge's approval "at least 10 days' written notice that approval for such gifts will be sought and that objection may be filed with the clerk of the superior court, of the county in which the guardian or trustee was appointed," to those named as legatees or devisees, if incompetent has executed a will, or to those who would be heirs and distributees if the incompetent died intestate contemporaneously with the filing of the petition.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Opportunity to Present Facts to Court.
   
   - Former G.S. 35-29.12 recognizes the contingent or potential interest of those who would probably benefit financially by the death of an incompetent; and, because of their interest, notice must be given to them. Those who must have notice are given an opportunity to present to the court facts which will assist the court in determining whether the action proposed by the trustee is detrimental to the estate of the incompetent, or whether the incompetent, if then competent, would probably not act as the trustee proposes to act. In re Trusteeship of Kenan, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 627</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 547 (1964).

      </p>
      <p>
       Beneficiaries Are Not Parties to Trustee's Proceeding.
   
   - Those named as beneficiaries in an incompetent's will have no interest in her properties so long as she lives. They take at her death only such properties as she then owns. They are not parties, and former G.S. 35-29.12 does not purport to make them parties, to a proceeding initiated by the trustee.

The standby guardian shall file the proof of death in the office of the clerk who entered the order within 90 days of the date of the petitioner's death or the standby guardian's authority may be rescinded by the clerk.

The standby guardian shall file a copy of the determination of incapacity in the office of the clerk who entered the order within 90 days of the date of the receipt of such determination, or the standby guardian's authority may be rescinded by the clerk.

Another person may sign the written consent on the petitioner's behalf and at the petitioner's direction if the petitioner is physically unable to do so, provided such consent is signed in the presence of the petitioner and the two witnesses.
