                        This Act is based, in part, on the provisions of the Uniform Planned Community Act. Many sections, however, have been substantially revised from those that appear in the Uniform Act. Some other sections marked "Reserved" contained provisions which were
                        included in the Uniform Act but were deemed inappropriate for inclusion in this Act. Because of these differences, the Official Comments to the Uniform Act have not been included.

                    <p>
                        Power of Homeowners' Association Not Covered by Act. - In a community that was not subject to the North Carolina Planned Community Act, the homeowners' association's amendment to the declaration of restrictive covenants to provide almost unlimited power
                        to assess lot owners was unreasonable; the amendment exceeded the original intent of the contracting parties, as the original declaration provided no such authority, and the community had public roads, no common areas, and no amenities.
                        Armstrong v. Ledges Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 547</cite>, 633 S.E.2d 78 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Where a community is not governed by the North Carolina Planned Community Act, amendments to a declaration of restrictive covenants must be reasonable; reasonableness may be ascertained from the language of the declaration, deeds, and plats, together
                        with other objective circumstances surrounding the parties' bargain, including the nature and character of the community. Armstrong v. Ledges Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 547</cite>,

                        Because there was no evidence in the record that a resolution was added by amendment to the homeowners association's recorded covenants, conditions and restrictions at the time the owners' fines were assessed against them, the association was bound by

                    A zoning, subdivision, or building code or other real estate use law, ordinance, or regulation may not prohibit a planned community or impose any requirement upon a planned community which it would not impose upon a substantially similar development under

                    No local ordinance or regulation may require the recordation of a declaration prior to the date required by this Chapter.

                        Applicability. - Trial court properly dismissed the parties' claims and counterclaims regarding a clubhouse because the Planned Community Act did not forbid the arrangement whereby the developer retained ownership of the clubhouse and the homeowners association
                        (HOA) was obligated to assess dues to the owners and remit the dues to the developer, the one-year time limit only applied to challenges to "amendments" to an existing declaration, not to challenges to the declaration itself, and
                        the HOA was statutorily authorized to collect the clubhouse dues. Conleys Creek Limited Partnership v. Smoky Mt. Country Club Prop.

                        how the dues were to be collected in the declaration as originally written, and was a valid and enforceable amendment. Kimler v. Crossings at Sugar Hill Prop. Owner's Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite>                        518, 789 S.E.2d 507 (2016).

                        Homeowners' Associations. - The trial court correctly held that the statute provided an association with power to impose reasonable fines against its members as nothing in the association's Articles of Incorporation or Declaration limited fining powers.

                        Statute does not require homeowners' associations to wield the enumerated powers, but merely provides them an option to do so; the statute also explicitly states that the listed powers are subject to the provisions of the articles of incorporation or
                        the declaration. Wise v. Harrington Grove Cmty. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 396</cite>, 584 S.E.2d 731 (2003).

                        of disinterested directors was present and voted at a special meeting, and the POA availed itself of the statutory procedure to bring its own claims against the third parties. Anderson v. Seascape at Holden Plantation, LLC,

                        In a dispute over a homeowners' association's duty to collect dues, the association's claim that the association had no authority to collect dues for a clubhouse failed because (1) the association had statutory authority to collect dues for services provided
                        to lot owners, and (2) the clubhouse owner provided a service to homeowners. Conleys Creek Ltd. P'ship v. Smoky Mt. Country Club Prop. Owners Ass'n, - N.C. App. - , 799 S.E.2d 879 (2017), sub. op., 805 S.E.2d 147,

                        to use a clubhouse did not entitle the homeowner to reimbursement. Conleys Creek Ltd. P'ship v. Smoky Mt. Country Club Prop. Owners Ass'n, - N.C. App. - , 799 S.E.2d 879 (2017), sub. op., 805 S.E.2d 147,

                        Trial court properly dismissed the parties' claims and counterclaims regarding a clubhouse because the Planned Community Act did not forbid the arrangement whereby the developer retained ownership of the clubhouse and the homeowners association (HOA)
                        was obligated to assess dues to the owners and remit the dues to the developer, the one-year time limit only applied to challenges to "amendments" to an existing declaration, not to challenges to the declaration itself, and the
                        HOA was statutorily authorized to collect the clubhouse dues. Conleys Creek Limited Partnership v. Smoky Mt. Country Club Prop.

                        Homeowners' Association May Obtain Power to Fine Its Members Through Amendment of the Declaration. - Where the declaration of a homeowners' association created prior to 1999 is silent as to whether an association has the power to fine its own members,
                        but provides, as the instant declaration does, for amendment of the declaration provisions, the homeowners' association may certainly obtain the power to fine its members as described under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t47Fa03s47F-3-102" target="_self">G.S. 47F-3-102(12)</a></cite>                        by following the prescribed amendment procedure and by adding appropriate language to the declaration.

                        Power to Impose Fines. - Homeowners' association (association) had no power to fine homeowners for not posting a bond to perform landscape maintenance on the homeowners' lot because (1) the covenants only allowed the association to impose reasonable fees
                        for the use of common areas or to assess costs for damage to common areas caused by activity on a homeowner's lot, and (2) this authority granted by the covenants could not be implied to let the association impose the fine. McVicker

                        Power to Rescind Fines. - Board of directors of a property owners' association (association) (board) had authority to rescind the imposition of fines because (1) the power of an entity to take action inherently included the power to alter or rescind such
                        actions once taken, and (2) the association's governing documents, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t47Fa03s47F-3-102" target="_self">G.S. 47F-3-102(17)</a></cite>, and Robert's Rules of Order could not reasonably
                        be interpreted to prevent the board from ever revising or rescinding fines previously imposed or re-visiting any board action previously taken. Bilodeau v.

                        Owner Prevented Access to Property. - Trial court properly denied a home owner's association (HOA) a directed verdict on a property owner's counterclaim seeking damages done to her property because evidence was presented to allow the jury to determine
                        the owner was prevented access to her property and unaware of the construction and lowering of the elevation of a road to the detriment of her property; evidence was presented to show the HOA had changed the lock on the entrance

                        Fines were not properly imposed on members of a property owners' association because no written notice of the imposition of fines was mailed to the members as required by the association's bylaws, even if the members were given a proper opportunity to

                        Foreclosure. - It was no error to deny a mortgagee's motion to set aside a homeowners' association's foreclosure because (1) the mortgagee had notice mailed to an address the mortgagee gave in prior communications, and (2) the mortgagee did not timely
                        object within one year. In re Foreclosure of Real Prop. Under Deed of Trust from Garrett, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 795 S.E.2d 1 (2016).

                        Trial court did not err in declining to join a trustee as a necessary party because he was not a necessary to either the proceeding to set aside the foreclosure sale or the joint motion for relief; the proceedings did not endeavor to foreclose upon the

                    <p>
                        Trial court correctly determined a foreclosure sale was void due to lack of personal jurisdiction over the homeowner because the foreclosure trustee failed to serve all record owners of the property; the attempted service of the notice of foreclosure
                        upon the homeowner by leaving a copy at the property was inadequate because the property was not his dwelling house or usual place of abode. In re Proposed Foreclosure of Claim of Lien Filed on George,

                        because, when the association sought to file a cross-appeal after the homeowners appealed the trial court's judgment on other matters, the association did not file a notice of the association's cross-appeal with the trial court,
                        as required by N.C. R. App. P. 3(a), so the appellate court had no jurisdiction over the cross-appeal. Reidy v. Whitehart Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 648 S.E.2d 265 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 696</cite>,
