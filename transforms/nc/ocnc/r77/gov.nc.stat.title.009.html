     </h3>
     <p>
      Not later than July 1, 1967, there shall be appointed in each county a jury commission of three members. One member of the commission shall be appointed by the senior regular resident superior court judge, one member by the clerk of superior court, and one member by the board of county commissioners. The appointees shall be qualified voters of the county, and shall serve for terms of two years. Appointees may be reappointed to successive terms. A vacancy in the commission shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment, for the unexpired term. Each commissioner shall take an oath or affirmation that, without favor or prejudice, he will honestly perform the duties of a member of the jury commission during his term of service. The compensation of commissioners shall be fixed by the board of county commissioners, and shall be paid from the general fund of the county. All expenses necessary to carry out the provisions of this Chapter and to administer the jury system, including all data processing, document processing, supplies, postage, and other similar expenses, except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, shall be paid from the general fund of the county, except that the clerk of superior court shall furnish clerical or other personnel assistance, as the commission may reasonably require.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t09a01s9-2ol1a">
       It shall be the duty of the jury commission during every odd-numbered year to prepare a master list of prospective jurors qualified under this Chapter to serve in the biennium beginning on January 1 of the next year. Instead of providing a master list for an entire biennium, the commission may prepare a master list each year if the senior regular resident superior court judge requests in writing that it do so.
      </li>
      <li id="t09a01s9-2ol1b">
       In preparing the master list, the jury commission shall use the list of registered voters and persons with drivers license records supplied to the county by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles pursuant to G.S. 20-43.4. The commission may use fewer than all the names from the list if it uses a random method of selection. The commission may use other sources of names deemed by it to be reliable.
      </li>
      <li id="t09a01s9-2ol1c">
       ,   (d) Repealed by Session Laws 2003-226, s. 7(d), effective January 1, 2004.
      </li>
      <li id="t09a01s9-2ol1e">
       The jury commission shall merge the entire list of names of each source used and randomly select the desired number of names to form the master list.
      </li>
      <li id="t09a01s9-2ol1f">
       The master list shall contain not less than one and one-quarter times and not more than three times as many names as were drawn for jury duty in all courts in the county during the previous biennium, or, if an annual list is being prepared as requested under subsection (a) of this section the master list shall contain not less than one and one-quarter times and not more than three times as many names as were drawn for jury duty in all courts in the county during the previous year but in no event shall the list include fewer than 500 names, except that in counties in which a different panel of jurors is selected for each day of the week, there is no limit to the number of names that may be placed on the master list.

       As used in this section "random" or "randomly" refers to a method of selection that results in each name on a list having an equal opportunity to be selected.
      </li>
      <li id="t09a01s9-2ol1i">
       To facilitate random selection of jurors, all the names on the master list may be sorted into random order before the first panel is drawn. Thereafter, names may be selected sequentially from the randomized list without further randomization, except as required by G.S. 15A-1214.
      </li>
      <li id="t09a01s9-2ol1j">
       The procedure for performing the preparation of the master list shall be in writing, adopted by the jury commission, and kept available for public inspection in the office of the clerk of court. The procedure must effectively preserve the authorized grounds for disqualification, the right of public access to the master list of prospective jurors as provided by G.S. 9-4, and the time sequence for drawing and summoning a jury panel.

      <li id="t09a01s9-2ol1k">
       In counties utilizing electronic data processing equipment, the functions of preparing and maintaining custody of the master list of prospective jurors, the procedure for drawing and summoning panels of jurors, and the procedure for maintaining records of names of jurors who have served, been excused or disqualified, or whose service has been deferred may be performed by this equipment, except that decisions as to mental or physical competence of prospective jurors shall continue to be made by jury commissioners.

        The plan in this section for the selection and drawing of jurors is constitutional
   
   and provides a jury system completely free of discrimination to any cognizable group. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972); State v. Foddrell, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 546</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 618 (1977); State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 105</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 828 (1977).

       </p>
       <p>
        Power of State to Prescribe Qualifications of Jurors.
   
   - Absent discrimination by race or other identifiable group or class, a State is at liberty to prescribe such qualifications for jurors as it deems proper without offending U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 411</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 345, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1024, 90 S. Ct. 599, 24 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1970).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Technical and insubstantial violations of the statutes regulating jury selection
   
   in this Chapter are not sufficient to vitiate a jury list or afford a challenge to the array. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 558</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 811 (1986).

        Special Statute Allowing Other Method.
   
   - Where a statute creating a special criminal court for certain counties allows every facility to the accused for getting a fair and impartial jury, it is not unconstitutional because it does not follow the same methods of drawing the jury which are provided for by the superior courts.

   to review the jury venire in the county over a substantial period of time to determine whether the jury commission failed to perform its statutory duty when compiling the jury venire from which defendant's jury would be selected where defendant presented no evidence that the new jury selection process in the county was discriminatory, or that the services of a statistician would have resulted in the selection of a more favorable jury.

        Selection of Names only from Certain Letters of Alphabet.
   
   - Names for the list of grand and petit jurors were not chosen arbitrarily or nonsystematically in violation of this section where every fourth name from the tax list was taken only from the letters A, B, C, D and M rather than from the entire alphabet. However, the practice of choosing names only from certain letters of the alphabet is not approved, since this section seems to contemplate systematic selection of names from the entire alphabet.

        Jury List Not Discriminatory Because Made from Tax List.
   
   - A jury list is not discriminatory merely because it is made from the tax list. The tax list is perhaps the most comprehensive list available for the names of male citizens. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 419</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 109 (1964) (decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-1" target="_self">G.S. 9-1</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        A jury list is not discriminatory or unlawful because it is drawn from the tax list of the county. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the tax lists contained a disproportionate male-female ratio, such disproportion did not result from a systematic, arbitrary and intentionally discriminatory process on the part of the jury commission.

        Failure to Use List of Names Not Appearing on Tax Lists.

State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 411</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 345 (1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1024, 90 S. Ct. 599, 24 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1970).

        Jury Commission Need Not Ascertain Validity of Procedures Used in Compiling Lists.
   
   - To hold that a jury commission must ascertain the validity of the procedures used by independent bodies in compiling tax and voter registration lists before using such lists as sources of names of prospective jurors would be to impose an impossible burden. State v. Tant, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 191 S.E.2d 387, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 429</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 839 (1972); 414 U.S. 938, 94 S. Ct. 240, 38 L.

        Removal of Certain Names from Lists.
   
   - Where commissioners laid aside names of several persons, otherwise qualified, because they did not know whether they were residents of the county, and the jury list was completed by the names of other duly qualified persons, if there was any irregularity it did not affect the action of the jurors so drawn and summoned. State v. Wilcox, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 847</cite>, 10 S.E. 453 (1889) (decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-1" target="_self">G.S. 9-1</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Merely purging the jury list of the names of those who had not paid their taxes, without adding any new names thereto, does not vitiate the venire in the absence of bad faith or corruption on the part of the county commissioners.

        <b>
         How Prima Facie Case of Purposeful Discrimination Established.
        </b>
        - The petitioner has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination. A prima facie case of jury discrimination can be established through a showing of a substantial disparity between the percentage of black residents in the county as a whole and on the jury lists, or by a showing of such disparity between the percentages of black residents on the tax rolls, from which the jury lists are drawn, and on the jury lists. Such a showing is strengthened where the disparity originated, at least in part, at the one point in the selection process where the jury commissioners invoked their subjective judgment rather than objective criteria. Parker v. Ross, 330 F. Supp. 13 (E.D.N.C. 1971), rev'd on other grounds, 470 F.2d 1092 (4th Cir. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The disparity between the percentage of black residents over 21 years of age in a county (45.5%) and on the jury list (4.5%) constituted a prima facie case of systematic exclusion of black residents from the county grand and petit jury lists. Parker v. Ross, 330 F. Supp. 13 (E.D.N.C. 1971), rev'd on other grounds, 470 F.2d 1092 (4th Cir. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish a prima facie case of systematic racial exclusion, defendants are generally required to produce not only statistical evidence establishing that black residents were underrepresented on the jury, but also evidence that the selection procedure itself was not racially neutral, or that for a substantial period in the past relatively few black residents have served on the juries of the county notwithstanding a substantial black population therein, or both. State v. Foddrell, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 546</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 618 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to establish a prima facie case that there has been a violation of the requirement that a jury be composed of persons who represent a fair cross section of the community, defendant must document that the group alleged to have been excluded is a distinctive group; that the representation of the group in question within the venire is not fair and reasonable with respect to the number of such persons in the community; and that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 437</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 103 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Distinctiveness of Excluded Group.
   
   - In determining whether a group is distinctive or cognizable for the purpose of a challenge to a jury selection plan, three factors which must be considered are whether there is some quality or attribute in existence which defines or limits the membership of the alleged group, whether there is a cohesiveness of attitudes, ideas, or experiences which serves to distinguish the purported group from the general social mileau, and whether a community of interest must be present within the alleged group which may not be represented by other segments of the populace. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 437</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 103 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The North Carolina Supreme Court does not recognize "young people" between the ages of 18 and 29 as a distinct group
   
   for the purpose of determining whether a jury panel represents a fair cross section of the community. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 437</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 103 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Effect of State's Failure to Justify Disparity.
        </b>
        - If a prima facie case of jury discrimination is proven, the State must justify the disparity. However, the State's failure to do so does not mean that a guilty defendant must go free. The State may indict and try him again by the procedure which conforms to constitutional requirements. Parker v. Ross, 330 F. Supp. 13 (E.D.N.C. 1971), rev'd on other grounds, 470 F.2d 1092 (4th Cir. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sample of 40 Jurors Insufficient.
   
   - A small sample of 40 jurors from the master list of jurors of a county alone was insufficient to establish a systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury pool. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 712</cite>, 392 S.E.2d 78 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Discrimination Not Established.
   
   - There was no systematic exclusion of blacks, women and 18- through 21-year-olds where jury commissions used a neutral systematic selection procedure (e.g., every 6th name) in selecting names from the source lists as required by this section, and it appeared that the only criteria used in striking names from the jury lists were the permissible disqualifications set out in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-3" target="_self">G.S. 9-3</a></cite>. State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 105</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 828 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the defendant's proof showed that during the period in question blacks made up 17.1 percent of the jury pool but 31.1 percent of the county's population, and young people between the ages of 18 and 29 made up 22.5 percent of the jury pool but 33.3 percent of the county's population, the defendant failed to show that such misrepresentation was the result of a systematic exclusion of those groups by the jury selection process, since the jury commission had fairly and reasonably selected every second name from the county tax listing and every third name from the county voter registration list. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 437</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 103 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence showed that jury lists were compiled in strict compliance with this section, the mere fact that only 15 percent of the jury pool was black in a county in which the population was 24 percent black was insufficient to show systematic discrimination. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 249</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 761 (1981), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1213, 103 S. Ct. 3552, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1398, rehearing denied, 463 U.S. 1249, 104 S. Ct. 37, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1456 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant failed to present evidence showing a gross discrepancy between the percentage of non-whites in a jury venire randomly selected by computer from the county voter registration list prescribed by this section as a master list, defendant's challenges under U.S. Const., Amends. VI and XIV to the grand jury and petit jury venire would be rejected. State v. Avery, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 1</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 786 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 1</cite>, 383 S.E.2d 591 (1989).
       </p>

        Where although the jury commissioners failed to strictly comply with this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-2.1" target="_self">G.S. 9-2.1</a></cite> [now repealed] and 9-5, all of the evidence tended to negate any corrupt intent, discrimination, or irregularities which affected the actions of the jurors actually drawn and summoned, and the trial judge found, on competent evidence, that the jurors were randomly selected, both from the voter list and the driver's license list, and that the selection of the master jury list was in substantial compliance with the law, there was no justification for a dismissal of the indictment or challenge to the array on grounds that statutory procedures were violated in the compilation of the jury list. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 558</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 811 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Requiring Defense Counsel to Investigate Jury Selection Procedures.
   
   - It places no undue burden on defense counsel to require them to make investigations into jury composition and selection procedures with regard to possible systematic racial exclusion prior to the time of trial, so long as the time between retention or appointment of counsel, the date the jury panel is drawn, and the date of trial is not so brief as to make such investigation impractical. State v. Harbison, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 474</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 449 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable Time Allowed Defendant to Investigate Improper Procedures.
   
   - A defendant must be allowed a reasonable time and opportunity to inquire into and present evidence regarding the alleged systematic exclusion of black persons because of their race from serving on the grand or petit jury in his case. Whether he was afforded a reasonable time and opportunity must be determined from the facts in each particular case. State v. Harbison, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 474</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 449 (1977).

       The North Carolina plan which imposes a two-year lapse in preparation of new jury lists is constitutional
   
   and provides a jury system completely free of discrimination to any cognizable group. State v. Kirby, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 480, 190 S.E.2d 320, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 761</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 363 (1972).

      <p>
       Excuse Based on Age.
   
   - Statutory scheme allowing trial judge to exercise his discretion to excuse jurors over the age of 65 has a rational basis and is not constitutionally infirm. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 420</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 859 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no error in defendant's murder case when a trial judge refused to disqualify a juror who was over the age of 65; a prospective juror over that age had a right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-3" target="_self">G.S. 9-3</a></cite> to serve, and while such a juror had a right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-6.1" target="_self">G.S. 9-6.1</a></cite> to request an exemption, the trial judge had discretion whether to excuse any juror. The language of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-6.1" target="_self">G.S. 9-6.1</a></cite> and 9-6(a) gave the court considerable latitude to deal with prospective jurors and particular problems, and the trial judge, after questioning the prospective juror, genuinely exercised his judicial discretion in refusing to excuse her. State v. Elliott, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 400</cite>, 628 S.E.2d 735 (2006).

It was also clear from the text of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-3" target="_self">G.S. 9-3</a></cite>, 9-6(a), and 9-6.1, that whether a juror should be excused from jury service is a decision which rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, and after questioning the prospective juror as to whether or not she thought that she could sit and listen to the evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing her to sit as a juror.

       Inability to Understand English.
   
   - The defendant was not entitled to a mistrial after a prospective juror who responded to two of the prosecutor's questions in Spanish was excused for cause, because his subsequent English responses revealed that his inability to understand English made him unqualified to serve as a juror under this section; any arguable error in not ordering the minimal dialogue in Spanish to be translated for the record was, given the wholly proper excusal, without prejudicial effect. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 531</cite>, 532 S.E.2d 773 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 949, 121 S. Ct. 1419, 149 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The law guarantees the right of trial by a proper jury;
   
   that is to say, a jury possessing the qualifications contemplated by law. It was the manifest purpose of the legislature that all those and only those citizens who possess the proper qualifications of character and intelligence should be selected to serve on juries. State v. Ingram, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 197</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 532 (1953).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere Showing of Violation of Statutory Procedures Does Not Merit Quashing Indictment.
   
   - In the absence of statutory language indicating that preparation of jury lists shall be void if the directions of the act be not strictly observed, a mere showing of a violation of the statutory procedures will not merit the quashing of an indictment. State v. Vaughn, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 167</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 210 (1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 935, 99 S. Ct. 2060, 60 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Corrupt Intent, Discrimination or Irregularities Must Be Shown.
   
   - In order to justify a dismissal of an indictment on grounds that statutory procedures were violated in the compilation of the jury list, a party must show either corrupt intent, discrimination, or irregularities which affect the actions of the jurors actually drawn and summoned. State v. Vaughn, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 167</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 210 (1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 935, 99 S. Ct. 2060, 60 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       And even a showing that certain qualified persons were improperly disqualified
   
   would not require a dismissal of an indictment absent a showing of corrupt intent or systematic discrimination in the compilation of the list, or a showing of the presence upon the grand jury itself of a member not qualified to serve. State v. Vaughn, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 167</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 210 (1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 935, 99 S. Ct. 2060, 60 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The judge is not required to make findings
   
   in the absence of evidence that any qualified person was excluded from jury service, and in the absence of contradictory and conflicting evidence as to the material facts. State v. Vaughn, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 167</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 210 (1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 935, 99 S. Ct. 2060, 60 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no systematic exclusion
   
   of blacks, women and 18- through 21-year-olds where jury commissions used a neutral systematic selection procedure (e.g., every 6th name) in selecting names from the source lists as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-2" target="_self">G.S. 9-2</a></cite>, and it appeared that the only criteria used in striking names from the jury lists were the permissible disqualifications set out in this section. State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 105</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 828 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for a defendant to preserve his exception to the court's denial of a challenge for cause,
   
   he must (1) excuse the challenged juror with a peremptory challenge, (2) exhaust his peremptory challenges before the panel is completed, and (3) thereafter seek, and be denied peremptory challenge to an additional juror. State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 739, 246 S.E.2d 837 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere Summons Does Not Disqualify Person for Two Years.
   
   - It is actual service as a juror rather than a mere summons for jury duty which disqualifies him for service for the next two years. State v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 240 S.E.2d 633, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 737</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 155 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The absence from the jury list of the names of persons between the ages of 18 and 21
   
   during the period from July 21, 1971, the effective date of the amendment of this section lowering the age requirement for jurors from 21 years to 18 years, and September 21, 1971, the date of defendant's trial, was not unreasonable and did not constitute systematic exclusion of this age group from jury service. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 542</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 249 (1972); State v. Barnwell, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 194 S.E.2d 63, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 106</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 634 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The petit jury which served at the trial of a 20-year-old defendant was not invalidated by the fact that the jury list had not been revised to include the names of persons under 21 years of age. State v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 508, 188 S.E.2d 690 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Alienage.
   
   - Alienage is disqualification of a juror. Hinton v. Hinton, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 341</cite>, 145 S.E. 615 (1928).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Juror No Longer Resident of County.
   
   - Trial court properly executed its authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa72s15A-1211ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1211(b)</a></cite> to determine that a prospective juror failed to meet the statutory requirements to sit as a juror in a trial; the court excused the prospective juror from the jury because she was no longer a resident of the county where the trial took place. State v. Tirado, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 551</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 515 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 909, 125 S. Ct. 1600, 161 L. Ed. 2d 285 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant waived any challenge to the fact that a juror was not a resident of Durham County by failing to object at trial as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-3" target="_self">G.S. 9-3</a></cite>. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 535, 664 S.E.2d 21.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       That a juror had forfeited his citizenship
   
   by reason of conviction of a criminal offense was ground for challenge of the juror for cause under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-1" target="_self">G.S. 9-1</a></cite>. Young v. Southern Mica Co., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 644</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 795 (1953).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Challenges in Particular Actions for Bias, etc.
   
   - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-1" target="_self">G.S. 9-1</a></cite>, providing that good and lawful men, required by the Constitution to serve on juries, should be men found by the county commissioners to have paid taxes for the preceding year, of good moral character, and of sufficient intelligence, did not abolish challenges to jurors, in particular actions, for bias, interest, kinship, etc. State v. Vick, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 995</cite>, 43 S.E. 626 (1903).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Juror Must Qualify to Be Sworn in at the Beginning of Court.
   
   - Court committed no error in excusing a juror, where the transcript revealed that at the time jury selection commenced, the juror had previously served on a federal jury within two years and was not immediately qualified to serve in the instant case; the court could not, as defendant suggested, move the juror to a later panel and then swear her in at the time she was called. State v. Golphin, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 364</cite>, 533 S.E.2d 168 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 931, 121 S. Ct. 1379, 1380, 149 L. Ed. 2d 305 (2001), cert. dismissed, without prejudice, 805 S.E.2d 698, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 900 (2017), cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 587</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 594, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 93 (2018).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of Jurors Held Harmless.
   
   - The court's dismissal of six prospective jurors after unrecorded, private bench discussions was harmless where the preliminary questioning of prospective jurors did not result in the rejection of any juror whom defendant was entitled to have on the panel or the seating of any juror whom defendant was entitled to reject either for cause or peremptorily. State v. Cummings, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 281</cite>, 543 S.E.2d 849 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Waiver
   
   - On appeal from defendant's convictions on charges of first-degree murder and robbery with a firearm, the state supreme court refused to consider defendant's argument that the trial court erred by dismissing a juror for cause after the juror informed the court that he was convicted in Texas of committing several felonies in the 1970s, because defendant did not raise the argument that the juror's citizenship rights were restored by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html#t13s13-1" target="_blank">G.S. 13-1(5)</a></cite>, when the trial court dismissed the juror for cause. State v. Haselden, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 1</cite>, 577 S.E.2d 594 (2003).

       Reasonable Time Allowed Defendant to Investigate Improper Procedures.
   
   - A defendant must be allowed a reasonable time and opportunity to inquire into and present evidence regarding the alleged systematic exclusion of black persons because of their race from serving on the grand or petit jury in his case. Whether he was afforded a reasonable time and opportunity must be determined from the facts in each particular case. State v.

       § 9-5. Procedure for drawing panel of jurors.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At least 30 days prior to any session or sessions of superior or district court requiring a jury, the clerk of superior court or assistant or deputy clerk shall prepare or have electronically prepared a randomized list of names from the master jury list equal to the number of jurors required for the session or sessions scheduled. The clerk of superior court may decrease the number of randomized names to account for the addition of names of previously selected jurors whose service has been deferred to this session. For each week of a superior court session, the senior resident superior court judge for the district or set of districts as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIIa07s7A-41.1ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-41.1(a)</a></cite> in which the county is located shall specify the number of jurors to be drawn. For each week of a district court jury session, the chief district judge of the district court district in which the county is located shall specify the number of jurors to be drawn. Pooling of jurors between or among concurrent sessions of various courts is authorized in the discretion of the senior regular resident superior court judge. When pooling is utilized, the senior regular resident superior court judge, after consultation with the chief district judge when a district court jury is required, shall specify the total number of jurors to be drawn for such concurrent sessions. When grand jurors are needed, at least nine additional names shall be drawn.
     </p>
     <p>
      The clerk of superior court shall either (i) prepare and issue the summonses or (ii) deliver the printed summonses or the list of names and addresses of jurors to the sheriff, who shall issue the summonses in accordance with the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a02s9-10ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 9-10(a)</a></cite>. The persons so summoned may serve as jurors in either the superior or the district court, or both, for the week for which summoned. Jurors who serve each week shall be discharged at the close of the weekly session or sessions, unless actually engaged in the trial of a case, and then they shall not be discharged until their service in that case is completed.

The procedures shall provide for the time and place, publicly announced, at which applications for excuses will be heard, and prospective jurors who have been summoned for service shall be so informed. In counties located in a district or set of districts as defined in G.S. 7A-41.1(a) which have a trial court administrator, the chief district judge may assign the duty of passing on applications for excuses from jury service to the administrator.

       Judges' Power to Excuse Jurors.
   
   - Although subsection (f) of this section provides that superior court judges have the power to excuse jurors, this power must be exercised within the constraints of constitutional requirements. State v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 272</cite>, 415 S.E.2d 716 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section places the process of juror excusals within the discretion of the district court judge, and a defendant is not entitled to a new trial for improper jury excusals in the absence of evidence of corrupt intent, discrimination, or irregularities which affected the actions of the jurors actually drawn and summoned. State v. Leary, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 109</cite>, 472 S.E.2d 753 (1996).

      <p>
       There was no error in defendant's murder case when a trial judge refused to disqualify a juror who was over the age of 65; a prospective juror over that age had a right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-3" target="_self">G.S. 9-3</a></cite> to serve. It was also clear from the text of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-3" target="_self">G.S. 9-3</a></cite>, 9-6(a), and 9-6.1, that whether a juror should be excused from jury service is a decision which rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, and after questioning the prospective juror as to whether or not she thought that she could sit and listen to the evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing her to sit as a juror. State v. Elliott, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 400</cite>, 628 S.E.2d 735 (2006).

       There was no error in defendant's murder case when a trial judge refused to disqualify a juror who was over the age of 65; a prospective juror over that age had a right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-3" target="_self">G.S. 9-3</a></cite> to serve, and while such a juror had a right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-6.1" target="_self">G.S. 9-6.1</a></cite> to request an exemption, the trial judge had discretion whether to excuse any juror. The language of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-6ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 9-6(a)</a></cite> gave the court considerable latitude to deal with prospective jurors and particular problems, and the trial judge, after questioning the prospective juror, genuinely exercised his judicial discretion in refusing to excuse her.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Excuse Based on Age.
   
   - Statutory scheme allowing trial judge to exercise his discretion to excuse jurors over the age of 65 has a rational basis and is not constitutionally infirm. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 420</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 859 (2002).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Strictly Comply with Section Not Grounds for New Trial.
   
   - Although it was clear that the district court judge failed to strictly comply with the provisions of this section governing the excusal of jurors, the alleged statutory irregularities did not constitute error; defendant was not entitled to a new trial because the evidence tended to negate any corrupt intent, discrimination or irregularities which affected the action of the jurors actually drawn and summoned. State v. Murdock, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 522</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 325 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       But Compliance with Section Suggested.
   
   - Although the actions of the trial judge did not result in error, the Supreme Court would suggest that district court judges excuse jurors only in keeping with the language and the spirit of this section. State v. Murdock, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 522</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 325 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Admonishment of Juror.
   
   - It is not improper for a judge to admonish a prospective juror for taking a position solely for the purpose of being excused from jury duty. State v. Weeks, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 152</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 895 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The selection process authorized by subsection (b) is essentially a pretrial screening process which is delegated to the district court, rather than a part of the capital trial. State v. McCarver, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 364</cite>, 462 S.E.2d 25 (1995), cert denied, 517 U.S. 1110, 116 S. Ct. 1332, 134 L. Ed. 2d 482 (1996).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right to Be Present at Pretrial Jury Selection.
   
   - The Supreme Court declined to extend the unwaivable right to be present at every stage of a capital trial to pretrial jury selection matters. State v. McCarver, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 364</cite>, 462 S.E.2d 25 (1995), cert denied, 517 U.S. 1110, 116 S. Ct. 1332, 134 L. Ed. 2d 482 (1996).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dismissal of Jurors Outside of Defendant's Presence Before Trial Upheld.
   
   - The trial court did not commit error in excusing prospective jurors prior to the calling of defendant's case as the defendant had no right to be present at that time because his trial had not yet begun. Furthermore, the defendant failed to demonstrate corrupt intent or that he was prejudiced by the jury that was impaneled. State v. Hyde, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 37</cite>, 530 S.E.2d 281 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1114, 121 S. Ct. 862, 148 L. Ed. 2d 775 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Juror Properly Excused.
   
   - Where prospective juror had a medical history including coronary bypass surgery and an addiction to Valium and stated that thinking about the case was "bringing the problem back" and stated that the stress of being a prospective juror awakened him in the middle of the night, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in excusing a prospective juror whose health was possibly in jeopardy. State v. Neal, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 608</cite>, 487 S.E.2d 734 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1125, 118 S. Ct. 1072, 140 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1998).

       Constitutionality
   
   - There is no constitutional infirmity in the statutory scheme as it relates to excusal of jurors over the age of 65 [now 72]. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 420</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 859 (2002).

       Juror Properly Excused.
   
   - Trial judge's failure to record his ex parte communication with one prospective juror as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1241" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1241</a></cite> was harmless error, where the record adequately revealed the substance of the unrecorded conversation, and the juror was properly excused under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-6ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 9-6(a)</a></cite> and 9-6.1 because "he was over sixty-five."

      <p>
       Excuse Based on Age.
   
   - Statutory scheme allowing trial judge to exercise his discretion to excuse jurors over the age of 65 [now age 72] has a rational basis and is not constitutionally infirm. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 420</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 859 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no error in defendant's murder case when a trial judge refused to disqualify a juror who was over the age of 65; a prospective juror over that age had a right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-3" target="_self">G.S. 9-3</a></cite> to serve, and while such a juror had a right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-6.1" target="_self">G.S. 9-6.1</a></cite> to request an exemption, the trial judge had discretion whether to excuse any juror. Judge asked juror if she was able to sit and listen to the evidence, she said that she was, and the court did not abuse its discretion in not excusing her. State v. Elliott, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 400</cite>, 628 S.E.2d 735 (2006).

      </p>
      <p>
       A motion for a change of venue or for a special venire from another county, upon the ground that the minds of the residents in the county in which the crime was committed had been influenced against the defendant, is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Ledbetter, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 303, 167 S.E.2d 68 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The section neither explicitly nor impliedly requires the judge to wait a certain amount of time so that a particular number of summonses can be served. State v. Mebane, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 418 S.E.2d 245, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 670</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 414 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Discretion of Selecting Officer.
   
   - Where an officer is empowered to select and summon talesmen he is vested with some discretion. It is his right and duty to use his best judgment in securing men of intelligence, courage, and good moral character, but he must act with entire impartiality. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 169 S.E.2d 895 (1969); State v. Nolen, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 172, 550 S.E.2d 783 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff Not Always Disqualified Where Deputy Testifies.
   
   - The legislature did not intend to disqualify sheriffs from summoning extra jurors in all cases in which deputy sheriffs testify. If this were so, the legislature would have designated some other official to summon extra jurors. If the sheriff were disqualified from summoning jurors in every case in which a defendant feels the sheriff is harassing him, there would be few if any sheriffs qualified to summon a juror. State v. Yancey, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 293 S.E.2d 298 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimony by a person in the sheriff's office
   
   does not disqualify the sheriff from summoning supplemental jurors to hear the matter. State v. Barnard, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 95</cite>, 484 S.E.2d 382 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that the sheriff and the chief deputy were testifying in case did not preclude members of the department from contacting jurors who failed to acknowledge their service of the summons. State v. Barnard, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 95</cite>, 484 S.E.2d 382 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Clerical Communications.
   
   - Where prospective jurors were contacted by the sheriff himself from a list he had received, and the sheriff merely asked the persons contacted if they had received their summons and if they intended to appear in court, the communication was pretrial and simply a clerical one assuring that the prospective jurors had been served with the summons. State v. Barnard, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 95</cite>, 484 S.E.2d 382 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no statutory or case authority prescribing the methods by which tales jurors must be selected.
   
   State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 169 S.E.2d 895 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowhere in the statute is there a provision delineating discretionary restrictions to be placed on an officer in fulfilling the court's order. The statutory recognition that tales jurors may be needed and the statutory language used contemplate a system easily and expeditiously administered. To place procedural restrictions unnecessarily on their selection would defeat the purpose of the system, which is to facilitate the dispatch of the business of the court. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 169 S.E.2d 895 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tales jurors are selected infrequently and only to provide a source from which to fill the unexpected needs of the court. They must still possess the statutory qualifications and are still subject to the same challenges as regular jurors and may be examined by both parties on voir dire. In order to retain the flexibility needed in the administration of such a system, the summoning official must be permitted some discretion, whether he be located in a relatively small community or a more heavily populated area, and to restrict the discretion placed in the summoning official, without proven cause, is to presume he is not worthy of the office which he holds. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 169 S.E.2d 895 (1969).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere Possibility of Discrimination Does Not Make Panel Objectionable.
   
   - Obviously it would be possible for a sheriff, sent out to execute an order of the court under this section to discriminate in the selection of persons to be summoned. This mere possibility does not make the panel actually summoned by him objectionable where the record shows that he did not so discriminate. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 169 S.E.2d 895 (1969).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Accused was not prejudiced because he was not furnished a list of persons called as supplemental jurors,
   
   where it became necessary to summon them after the court had properly excluded jurors from the original venire. State v. Fountain, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 58</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 674 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Discretion of Sheriff.
   
   - Absent proof that a sheriff violated the discretionary trust placed in him by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a02s9-11" target="_self">G.S. 9-11</a></cite>, he should remain free to use his best judgment in carrying out the orders of the court. State v. Nolen, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 172, 550 S.E.2d 783 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not prejudiced when the trial court ordered the sheriff to randomly recruit jurors
   
   in the middle of the jury selection process, in light of the fact that the defendant failed to exhaust his peremptory challenges. At this time, only one juror remained to be seated. The twelfth juror seated was one of the supplemental jurors, but the defendant still had one peremptory challenge remaining. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 516</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 450 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Special Venire Selected Without Partiality.
   
   - A challenge to the array on the ground that the sheriff and his deputies, under instructions by the sheriff, selected for the special venire freeholders of good character, who had not served on the jury within the past two years and who lived in townships in the county other than the township in which the crime was committed and townships contiguous thereto, was properly refused, the action of the sheriff and the deputies showing no partiality, misconduct and irregularity in making out the list. State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 438</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 371 (1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       A challenge to jury selection under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a02s9-11" target="_self">G.S. 9-11</a></cite> is sustainable when there is a partiality or misconduct on the sheriff's part or some irregularity in making out the list. State v. Nolen, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 172, 550 S.E.2d 783 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of the trial judge to sign the order for a special venire
   
   does not alone invalidate the special venire, it having been ordered and summoned in all other respects in conformity with statute. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 720</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 1 (1948).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Order Substantially a Special Writ of Venire Facias.
   
   - A written order entitled as of the action, commanding the sheriff to summon a special venire of twenty-five freeholders from the body of the county to appear on a specified date to act as jurors in the case, is in substance a special writ of venire facias. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 720</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 1 (1948).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Challenge for Cause.
   
   - Under this section where a special venire has been ordered by the court for the trial of a capital felony, the veniremen, being selected by the sheriff in his discretion, not from the jury box, are subject to the same challenges for cause as tales jurors. State v. Avant, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 680</cite>, 163 S.E. 806 (1932).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Objections Made by Challenges to the Array.
   
   - Objections to the special venire based on partiality, misconduct of the sheriff, or irregularity in making out the jury list, are properly made by challenges to the array. State v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 366</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 585 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A motion challenging the array of special jurors was properly denied
   
   where the motion did not challenge the order of the court directing the sheriff to select six supplemental jurors, nor the action of the sheriff in selecting the jurors, nor contend that black persons were systematically excluded by the sheriff in his selection of the six jurors. State v. Hollingsworth, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 674, 182 S.E.2d 26 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Special Venire Exhausted.
   
   - When a special venire is exhausted without completing the jury, the court may order a further venire to be summoned at once from the bystanders. State v. Stanton, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 1182</cite>, 24 S.E. 536 (1896).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Accessory May Be Tried by Special Venire.
   
   - Where two persons are indicted for murder, one as principal and the other as accessory before the fact, the latter may be tried by a jury selected from a special venire ordered in the case. State v. Register, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 746</cite>, 46 S.E. 21 (1903).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicability of Notice Provision.
   
   - The thirty day notice provision in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09a01s9-5" target="_self">G.S. 9-5</a></cite> did not apply to the trial court's selection of supplemental jurors under this section. State v. Dickens, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 26</cite>, 484 S.E.2d 553 (1997).

     Some of the cases below were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIVa07s1-86" target="_blank">G.S. 1-86</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Discretion of Court.
   
   - The trial judge, when he refused defendant's motion to remove an action for homicide to another county, in the exercise of his sound discretion, could have had the jurors summoned from any adjoining county, or from any county in the same judicial district, or had jurors drawn from the jury box of such county. State v. Kincaid, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 709</cite>, 110 S.E. 612 (1922); State v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 90</cite>, 179 S.E. 450 (1935), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIVa07s1-86" target="_blank">G.S. 1-86</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The granting of a solicitor's (now district attorney's) motion that the jury be drawn from the body of another county is within the court's discretion. State v. Shipman, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 518</cite>, 163 S.E. 657 (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       A motion for change of venue or, in the alternative, that a jury be summoned from another county, on the ground that defendant could not obtain a fair trial because of widespread and unfavorable publicity, was addressed to the discretion of the trial court, and where the record disclosed that the trial judge conducted a hearing, read all the affidavits, and examined the press releases, juror selected stated that he could render a verdict uninfluenced by the publicity, and defendant did not exhaust his peremptory challenges, abuse of discretion in denying the motion was not disclosed. State v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 329</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 10 (1967), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIVa07s1-86" target="_blank">G.S. 1-86</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The motion of the defendants that a jury be summoned from another county was addressed to the sound discretion of the presiding judge. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant's motion for a change of venue and his alternative motion for a special venire from another county were addressed to the sound legal discretion of the trial court. State v. Penley, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 170 S.E.2d 632 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section places the matter of ordering jurors to be summoned from another county in the sound discretion of the judge of the superior court. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 140</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 789 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Order Tantamount to Denial of Motion to Remove.
   
   - When the judge entered an order directing that venire of jurors be drawn from another county to serve as jurors in the trial, it was tantamount to a denial of a motion to remove the cases to another county for trial. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 300</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 563 (1962), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIVa07s1-86" target="_blank">G.S. 1-86</a></cite>.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Order Justified.
   
   - Due to the prior trials and the widespread publicity, the court on motion of the State was justified in ordering the trial jury drawn from another county. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 588</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 176 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Review of Discretion.
   
   - A judge's order, entered by virtue of authority vested in him by this section, is not reviewable, unless there has been a manifest abuse of his discretion. State v. Childs, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 307</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 453 (1967), death sentence vacated, 403 U.S. 948, 91 S. Ct. 2278, 29 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1971), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIVa07s1-86" target="_blank">G.S. 1-86</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A motion for change of venue or for a special venire may be granted or denied in the discretion of the trial judge, and his decision in the exercise of such discretion is not reviewable in the Court of Appeals unless gross abuse of discretion is shown. State v. Ledbetter, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 303, 167 S.E.2d 68 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant's motions for a change of venue or for a special venire from another county, on the ground that he could not get a fair and impartial trial in the county because of extensive publicity and public discussion of the cases, were addressed to the sound legal discretion of the trial court, whose ruling in denying these motions was not disturbed on appeal because (1) the newspaper articles filed in support of the motions were not unduly inflammatory in nature, (2) the articles were published three months prior to the trial and there was no evidence of repeated or excessive publication, and (3) those of the prospective jurors who had read the newspaper accounts stated that they could return an impartial verdict. State v. Penley, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 170 S.E.2d 632 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The courts have consistently held that a motion for removal to an adjacent county or to cause a jury to be selected from an adjacent county on the grounds of unfavorable publicity is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, and that, absent a showing of abuse of discretion, the decision of the trial court is not reviewable. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 210 S.E.2d 876, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 470</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 123 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Motions for change of venue or special venire are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and, absent abuse of discretion, his rulings will not be disturbed on appeal. State v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 644</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 551 (1976); State v. Hopper, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 580</cite>, 234 S.E.2d 580 (1977).

        Administering Oath to Prospective Jurors.
   
   - The phrase "at the beginning of court," as it applies to the swearing of prospective jurors, refers to the beginning of the term of court, as opposed to the beginning of an individual trial, which may be civil or criminal. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 634</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 415 (1998), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 838, 120 S. Ct. 102, 145 L. Ed. 2d 87, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 5307, 68 U.S.L.W. 3225 (1999).

        The presiding judge has the duty to supervise the examination of prospective jurors.

        Regulation of the manner and extent of inquiries on voir dire
   
   rests largely in the trial judge's discretion. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 176</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 626 (1988); State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 142</cite>, 443 S.E.2d 14, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1046, 115 S. Ct. 642, 130 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1994).

       <p>
        Administration of Oath During Voir Dire.
   
   - The State's failure to administer an oath requiring prospective jurors to "tell the truth" during voir dire did not taint jury selection or violate defendant's right to a fair and impartial trial, where the jurors took the statutorily prescribed oath prior to trial and there was no evidence to show that the jury was unqualified to sit, or that he had been prejudiced in any way. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 634</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 415 (1998), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 838, 120 S. Ct. 102, 145 L. Ed. 2d 87, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 5307, 68 U.S.L.W. 3225 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court was not required to ask prospective jurors to swear to tell the truth during jury voir dire

        Juror Must Qualify to Be Sworn in at the Beginning of Court.
   
   - Court committed no error in excusing a juror, where the transcript revealed that at the time jury selection commenced, the juror had previously served on a federal jury within two years and was not immediately qualified to serve in the instant case; the court could not, as defendant suggested, move the juror to a later panel and then swear her in at the time she was called. State v. Golphin, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 364</cite>, 533 S.E.2d 168 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 931, 121 S. Ct. 1379, 1380, 149 L.

       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant is not entitled to a jury of his selection
   
   or choice, but only to a jury selected pursuant to law and without unconstitutional discrimination against a class or substantial group of the community from which the jury panel is drawn. He has no vested right to a particular juror. State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 288</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 241 (1969), death sentence vacated, 403 U.S. 948, 91 S. Ct. 2283, 29 L.

         II. CHALLENGE TO JURORS.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The right of challenge is not one to accept, but to reject.
   
   It is not given for the purpose of enabling the defendant, or the State, to pick a jury, but to secure an impartial one. State v. Allred, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 554</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 833 (1969); State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 210 S.E.2d 555 (1974), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 434 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1080, 96 S. Ct. 868, 47 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been held in many cases that the right to challenge a juror for cause is given to afford a litigant fair opportunity to remove objectionable jurors, and was not intended to enable him to select a jury of his own choosing. See Blevins v. Erwin Cotton Mills Co., <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 493</cite>, 64 S.E. 428 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party has no right to seat a particular juror, but only to reject one who is prejudiced against him. State v. Duvall, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 275 S.E.2d 842, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 557</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 495 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Opinion of Juror.
   
   - The expression of an opinion is sometimes ground for challenge, but is not if the juror states that the opinion could be eliminated and a fair and impartial verdict rendered. State v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 724</cite>, 102 S.E. 406 (1920); State v. Winder, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 776</cite>, 111 S.E. 530 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        The challenge for this cause can be made only by that party against whom the opinion was formed and expressed. State v. Benton, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 196</cite> (1836).
       </p>
       <p>
        A juror may be examined as to opinions honestly formed, and honestly expressed, manifesting a bias of judgment, not referable to personal partiality, or malevolence; but if the opinion has been made up and expressed under circumstances which involve dishonor and guilt, and where such expression may be visited with punishment, he ought not to be required to testify so as to incriminate himself. State v. Benton, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 196</cite> (1836); State v. Mills, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 581</cite> (1884).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In an indictment for illegal sale of liquor, challenges for cause, in that the jurors belonged to the Anti-Saloon League,
   
   were properly disallowed, where the jurors had taken no part in prosecuting or aiding in the prosecution of the defendant. State v. Sultan, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 569</cite>, 54 S.E. 841 (1906).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The desire of a prospective juror to affirm rather than take an oath
   
   is not, of itself, cause for challenge in this State. State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 288</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 241 (1969), death sentence vacated, 403 U.S. 948, 91 S. Ct. 2283, 29 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1971); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 46</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 796, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 850, 94 S. Ct. 143, 38 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Relationship Between Juror and Party.
   
   - A juror, who was related to the defendant by blood or marriage within the ninth degree of kinship, was properly rejected when challenged by the State for cause on that ground. State v. Allred, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 554</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 833 (1969); State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1043, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Relationship Between Juror and Witness.
   
   - A relationship within the ninth degree between a juror and a State's witness, standing alone, is not legal ground for challenge for cause. Where such relationship exists and is known and recognized by the juror, a defendant's challenge for cause should be rejected only if it should appear clearly that, under the circumstances of the particular case, the challenged juror would have no reason or disposition to favor his kinsman by giving added weight to his testimony or otherwise. State v. Allred, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 554</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 833 (1969); State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1043, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Relationship of Juror to District Attorney.
   
   - The trial court did not err in the denial of defendant's challenge for cause directed to the district solicitor's (now district attorney's) father-in-law being a juror, where the challenge was denied only after the juror stated, upon being questioned by the court, that he would not convict on his relationship to the solicitor (now district attorney), and after it was ascertained that the district solicitor (now district attorney) was not prosecuting defendant's case. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1043, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1972).

       <p>
        Excluding Jurors for Opposition to Capital Punishment.
   
   - Under the decision of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S. Ct. 1770, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1968), a sentence of death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction. State v. Ruth, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 36</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 897 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment of the superior court sentencing defendant to death for first-degree murder had to be vacated under the decision of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S. Ct. 1770, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1968), where the trial court allowed the State's challenges for cause to seven prospective jurors who stated simply a general objection to or conscientious scruples against capital punishment, notwithstanding the trial occurred prior to the Witherspoon decision, since that decision was fully retroactive. State v. Ruth, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 36</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 897 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial judge should allow challenge for cause when a venireman is not willing to consider all possible penalties provided by State law and when the venireman is unalterably committed to vote against the death penalty, regardless of the evidence which might be presented at trial. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1043, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a capital case, if a prospective juror states that under no circumstances could he vote for a verdict that would result in the imposition of the death penalty no matter how aggravated the case and regardless of the evidence shown, the trial court can properly dismiss the juror upon a challenge for cause. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 90</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 803 (1974), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1212 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a capital case a juror may be properly challenged for cause if he indicates he could not return a verdict of guilty knowing the penalty would be death, even though the State proved to him by the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the capital crime charged. State v. Honeycutt, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 174</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 844 (1974), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3205, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1207 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a first-degree murder trial, where prospective juror stated that knowing that the death penalty would be imposed he did not feel that he could vote for a verdict of guilty even though he was satisfied of defendant's guilt, the trial judge, in his discretion, and at the request of the prospective juror, in excusing the prospective juror did not commit prejudicial error. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Time of Challenge.
   
   - The court may, in its discretion, permit a juror to be challenged by the State for cause, after he has been tendered to the defendant and before the jury is impaneled. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. 611</cite> (1886).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Excusing Unchallenged Juror.
   
   - The trial judge could excuse a juror, before the jury was impaneled, although the solicitor (now district attorney) had passed him to the defendant and had not challenged him for cause. State v. Vick, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 995</cite>, 43 S.E. 626 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the right and duty of the court to see that a competent, fair and impartial jury is impaneled and, to that end, the court, in its discretion, may excuse a prospective juror without a challenge by either party. It is immaterial that this is done as the result of information voluntarily disclosed by the prospective juror without questioning. State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 288</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 241 (1969), death sentence vacated, 403 U.S. 948, 91 S. Ct. 2283, 29 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1971); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 46</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 796, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 850, 94 S. Ct. 143, 38 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the duty of the trial judge to see that a competent, fair and impartial jury is impaneled, and to that end the judge may, in his discretion, excuse a prospective juror even without challenge from either party. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Method of Taking Advantage of Error.
   
   - The action of a trial judge in determining the qualifications of a juryman, if erroneous, was ground for a challenge to the array by a motion to quash and set aside the entire panel, and in the absence of such challenge a defendant could not be allowed to take advantage of the alleged error after trial and judgment. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 570</cite>, 26 S.E. 697 (1897).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The erroneous allowance of an improper challenge
   
   for cause did not entitle the adverse party to a new trial, so long as only those who were competent and qualified to serve were actually impaneled upon the jury which tried his case. This was especially true where the adverse party did not exhaust his peremptory challenges. State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 288</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 241 (1969), death sentence vacated, 403 U.S. 948, 91 S. Ct. 2283, 29 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1971); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 46</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 796, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 850, 94 S. Ct. 143, 38 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1973).

       </p>
       <p>
        The question of whether a juror is competent is one for the trial judge
   
   to determine in his discretion, and his rulings thereon are not reviewable on appeal unless accompanied by some imputed error of law. State v. Blount, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 561, 167 S.E.2d 444 (1969); State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 281</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 698 (1972); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court has broad discretion in the voir dire selection of jurors, and the exercise of the party's right to examine prospective jurors should be carefully supervised by the trial court. State v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 267, 201 S.E.2d 231 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The competency of jurors to serve is left largely to the sound legal discretion of the trial judge, and his rulings thereon are not subject to review on appeal unless accompanied by some imputed error of law. State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 210 S.E.2d 555 (1974), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 434 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1080, 96 S. Ct. 868, 47 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976).

        Ruling on motion for competency of jurors is discretionary with the trial judge and will not be reviewed absent a showing of abuse of discretion or an error of law. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 211 S.E.2d 470 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decisions as to a juror's competency at the time of selection and his continued competency to serve are matters resting in the trial judge's sound discretion and are not subject to review unless accompanied by some imputed error of law. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unquestionably the trial judge is vested with broad discretionary powers in determining the competency of jurors and that discretion will not ordinarily be disturbed on appeal. State v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 617</cite>, 234 S.E.2d 574 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial judge is vested with broad discretion in determining the competency of the jurors. State v. Duvall, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 275 S.E.2d 842, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 557</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 495 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial judge is empowered to decide all questions regarding the competency of jurors. His decision as to a juror's competency is a matter vested in his sound discretion and will be reversed only upon a demonstration that he abused this discretion. State v. King, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 603</cite>, 320 S.E.2d 1 (1984).

        Review of Discretion.
   
   - The rulings of the judge on questions as to the competency of jurors are not subject to review on appeal unless accompanied by some imputed error of law. State v. DeGraffenreid, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 517</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 523 (1944); State v. Davenport, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 475</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 686 (1947); State v. Suddreth, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 239</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 924 (1949); State v. Gibbs, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 457, 168 S.E.2d 507 (1969); State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 281</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 698 (1972); State v. Noell, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 670</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 750 (1974), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 902, 96 S. Ct. 3203, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1205 (1976); State v. Tatum, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 73</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 562 (1976); State v. Sweezy, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 366</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 524 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a juror in a homicide trial had sister of deceased as one of his passengers in a four-mile automobile trip, the defendant moved to set aside the verdict. The juror stated upon oath that he did not know that his passenger was the sister of the deceased, and the court found upon investigation that the case was not discussed during the ride. It was held that exception to refusal of motion was not reviewable. State v. Suddreth, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 239</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 924 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court's findings, upon supporting evidence, that persons of defendant's race were not excluded from the petit jury on account of race, were conclusive on appeal, and defendant's exception to the overruling of his challenge to the array on that ground presented no reviewable question of law. State v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 561</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 849, cert. denied, 338 U.S. 876, 70 S. Ct. 138, 94 L. Ed. 537 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant moved for a new trial on the ground that during the trial he discussed the case with one of the jurors before recognizing him as a juror. The court found that the defendant had not shown that he was in anywise prejudiced by the occurrence, and denied defendant's motion for a new trial. The ruling of the court was not reviewable. State v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 595</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 153 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        A ruling in respect to the impartiality of a juror presents no question of law for review. State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 210 S.E.2d 555 (1974), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 434 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1080, 96 S. Ct. 868, 47 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant seeking to establish on appeal that the exercise of judicial discretion constituted reversible error
   
   must show harmful prejudice as well as clear abuse of discretion. State v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 377</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 763 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3207, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1208 (1976).

        Purpose of Voir Dire.
   
   - The voir dire examination of jurors is a right secured to the defendant by the statutes and has a definite double purpose: first, to ascertain whether there exist grounds for challenge for cause; and, second, to enable counsel to exercise intelligently the peremptory challenges allowed by law. State v. Allred, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 554</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 833 (1969); State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 645</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 196 (1972); State v. Carey, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 497</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 213 (1974); State v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 377</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 763 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3207, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1208 (1976); In re Will of Worrell, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 278, 241 S.E.2d 343, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 90</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 263 (1978); State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 548, 251 S.E.2d 706, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 302</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 923 (1979); State v. Bracey, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 112</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 390 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the voir dire examination and the exercise of challenges, either peremptory or for cause, is to eliminate extremes of partiality and to assure both the defendant and the State that the persons chosen to decide the guilt or innocence of the accused will reach that decision solely upon the evidence produced at trial. State v. Honeycutt, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 174</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 844 (1974), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3205, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1207 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary purpose of the voir dire of prospective jurors is to select an impartial jury. State v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 617</cite>, 234 S.E.2d 574 (1977); In re Will of Worrell, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 278, 241 S.E.2d 343, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 90</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 263 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The voir dire examination of jurors allowed by this section serves the dual purpose of ascertaining whether grounds exist for challenge for cause to enable counsel to exercise intelligently the peremptory challenges allowed by law. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 280 S.E.2d 31, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 197</cite>, 285 S.E.2d 102 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Any party to an action, whether civil or criminal, is entitled to inquire
   
   into the fitness and competency of any prospective juror. State v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 267, 201 S.E.2d 231 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of inquiry concerning a prospective juror's competency and fitness to serve may be exercised by or on behalf of the defendant as well as the State. State v. Carey, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 497</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 213 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Each defendant is entitled to full opportunity to face the prospective jurors, make diligent inquiry into their fitness to serve, and to exercise his right to challenge those who are objectionable to him. State v. Boykin, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 264</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 914 (1976); State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 105</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 426 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prospective jurors may be asked questions which will elicit information not per se a ground for challenge
   
   in order that the party, propounding the question, may exercise intelligently his or its peremptory challenges. State v. Jarrette, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 625</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 721 (1974), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3205, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1206 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Questions Regarding Right to Make a Will.
   
   - In view of the possibility that many people, for one reason or another, do not agree with the statutory right of a person to make a will, propounders of a will should be allowed to question prospective jurors with respect to their feelings on that question. In re Will of Worrell, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 278, 241 S.E.2d 343, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 90</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 263 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Questioning of Jurors by Court or by Counsel.
   
   - Although this section assures a defendant of the right to have due inquiry made as to the competency and fitness of any person to serve as a juror, the actual questioning of prospective jurors to elicit the pertinent information may be conducted either by the court or by counsel for the State and counsel for the defendant. The trial judge, in his discretion, may decide which course to pursue in a particular case. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 645</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 196 (1972); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 46</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 796, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 850, 94 S. Ct. 143, 38 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1973); State v. Girley, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 219 S.E.2d 301 (1975), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 141</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 799 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibiting Ambiguous or Confusing Questions.
   
   - Discretion over the inquiry on voir dire was properly exercised when the trial court prohibited ambiguous or confusing hypothetical questions. State v. Denny, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 294</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 437 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Refusal of Court to Ask Question Requested by Counsel.
   
   - If the court, when it conducted the questioning, declined to ask a question requested by the defendant's counsel, an exception should have been noted so that an appellate court could consider the propriety, pertinence and substance of such question. This procedure avoids repetitive questioning without precluding or restricting any inquiry suggested and requested by defendant's counsel, and is not violative of this section or otherwise objectionable. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 645</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 196 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of District Attorney's Improper Statements During Voir Dire.
   
   - In a capital case, improper statements made by a district attorney in the presence of prospective jurors during their voir dire examination may well be as prejudicial as a similar statement made by him during argument to the jury. State v. Hines, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 377</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 201 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Regulation of Voir Dire Rests in Trial Judge's Discretion.
   
   - Counsel's exercise of the right to inquire into the fitness of jurors is subject to the trial judge's close supervision, and the regulation of the manner and the extent of the inquiry rests largely in the trial judge's discretion. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 92</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 745 (1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 987, 93 S. Ct. 1516, 36 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1973); State v. Bracey, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 112</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 390 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Regulation of the manner and the extent of the inquiry on voir dire rests largely in the trial judge's discretion. State v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 377</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 763 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3207, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1208 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel's exercise of the right to inquire into the fitness of jurors is subject to the trial judge's close supervision. The regulation of the manner and the extent of the inquiry rests largely in the trial judge's discretion. State v. Boykin, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 264</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 914 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The manner and extent of the inquiry of prospective jurors are matters committed largely to the discretion of the trial judge and are subject to his close supervision. State v. Denny, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 294</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 437 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge's Discretion Is Subject to Review.
   
   - While the regulation of the manner and extent of the inquiry on voir dire rests largely in the trial judge's discretion, his exercise of discretion is not absolute and is subject to review on appeal. In re Will of Worrell, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 278, 241 S.E.2d 343, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 90</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 263 (1978).

        Voir Dire Should Be Based on Questions Phrased in Witherspoon Language.
   
   - Since Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S. Ct. 1770, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1968) has so clearly specified the ultimate questions that must be answered, the voir dire examination of prospective jurors should be based on questions phrased in Witherspoon language, because unless this course is followed, new trials will often be necessary in cases otherwise free from prejudicial error. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Propriety of Examining Jurors' Attitudes.
   
   - In order to ensure a fair trial before an unbiased jury, it is entirely proper in a capital case for both the State and the defendant to make appropriate inquiry concerning a prospective juror's moral or religious scruples, beliefs, and attitudes toward capital punishment. State v. Honeycutt, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 174</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 844 (1974), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3205, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1207 (1976); State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 403</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 234, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a capital case both the State and the defendant may, on the voir dire examination of prospective jurors, make inquiry concerning a prospective juror's moral or religious scruples, his beliefs and attitudes toward capital punishment, to the end that both the defendant and the State may be ensured a fair trial before an unbiased jury. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 256</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 817 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        In many capital cases solicitors (now district attorneys) may ask prospective jurors whether they have moral or religious scruples against capital punishment, and if so, whether they are willing to consider all of the penalties provided by law, or are irrevocably committed to vote against a verdict carrying the death penalty regardless of the facts and circumstances that might be revealed by the evidence. State v. Carey, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 497</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 213 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no error in permitting questions to be propounded to prospective jurors concerning their views about the death penalty. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 422</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 113 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not improper on voir dire for the prosecutor to determine if jurors would be willing to impose the death penalty and what their views were on the death penalty. State v. Chapman, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 328</cite>, 611 S.E.2d 794 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Scope of Inquiries Is Within Control and Supervision of Court.
   
   - The extent of the inquiries to prospective jurors concerning their attitudes toward capital punishment remains under the control and supervision of the trial judge. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 422</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 113 (1975).

         III. CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.

       </h5>
       <p>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose.
   
   - The right to challenge is not given so as to allow a party to pick a jury, but so that he may obtain an impartial jury. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 92</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 745 (1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 987, 93 S. Ct. 1516, 36 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Excluding Jurors for Opposition to Capital Punishment.
   
   - If a prospective juror states that under no circumstances could he vote for a verdict that would result in the imposition of the death penalty no matter how aggravated the case and regardless of the evidence shown, the trial court can properly dismiss the juror upon a challenge for cause. State v. Avery, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 459</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 142 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3209, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1209 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurors who indicated they were irrevocably committed to vote against a verdict carrying the death penalty regardless of the facts and circumstances that might be revealed by the evidence were properly excused for cause. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975); State v. Foddrell, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 546</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 618 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where juror voiced general reservations about the death penalty, but made no affirmative, unequivocal statement that she was unwilling to consider the death penalty or that she was irrevocably committed to vote against it regardless of the facts and circumstances that might be revealed by the evidence, she was erroneously excused for cause. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a first-degree murder trial where prospective juror stated that knowing that the death penalty would be imposed he did not feel that he could vote for a verdict of guilty even though he was satisfied of defendant's guilt, the trial judge, in his discretion, and at the request of the prospective juror, in excusing the prospective juror did not commit prejudicial error. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is settled law that a challenge for cause should be sustained where the venireman challenged states unmistakably that he would, by reason of the death penalty, automatically vote against conviction without regard to any evidence developed at trial. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 505</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 663 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Veniremen may not be challenged for cause simply because they voice general objections to the death penalty or express conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction. State v. Foddrell, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 546</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 618 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Erroneous allowance of an improper challenge for cause
   
   did not entitle the adverse party to a new trial, so long as only those who were competent and qualified to serve were actually impaneled upon the jury which tried his case. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Excusal of Juror Without Challenge by Party.
   
   - In spite of the last phrase of subsection (a) of this section, it is the right and duty of the court to see that a competent, fair and impartial jury is impaneled and, to that end, the court, in its discretion, may excuse a prospective juror without a challenge by either party. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 148</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 10 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 932, 97 S. Ct. 339, 50 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1976).

       Participation of Alternate Juror in Deliberation Is Error.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       And Alternate Juror's Presence in Jury Room Is Reversible Error Per Se.
   
   - Where the alternate juror was not discharged when the jury retired as required by this section, and although the record showed that the court corrected its mistake after only three or four minutes had elapsed, and the alternate did not participate in the deliberation and verdict of the other 12, his brief visit to the jury room was reversible error per se. State v. Bindyke, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 608</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 521 (1975); State v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 226 S.E.2d 231 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       At any time an alternate juror is in the jury room during deliberations, he participates by his presence and, whether he says little or nothing, his presence will void the trial. State v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 226 S.E.2d 231 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presence of an alternate juror, either during the entire period of deliberation preceding the verdict, or his presence at any time during the deliberations of the 12 regular jurors, is a fundamental irregularity of constitutional proportions which requires a mistrial or vitiates the verdict, if rendered. And this is the result notwithstanding the fact that the defendant's counsel consented, or failed to object, to the presence of the alternate. State v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 226 S.E.2d 231 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presence of an alternate juror in the jury room during the jury's deliberations violates N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s2">

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       If alternate juror's presence in jury room is inadvertent
   
   and momentary, and it occurs under circumstances from which it can be clearly seen or immediately determined that the jury has not begun its function as a separate entity, then the rule of per se reversible error is not applicable. State v. Bindyke, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 608</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 521 (1975).

      <p>
       Inquiry into Effect of Presence of Alternate Juror.
   
   - If the judge, from his trial experience and knowledge of the circumstances of the particular case, believes it probable that the jury has not begun its consideration of the evidence, he may properly recall the jury and the alternate and, in open court, inquire of them whether there had been any discussion of the case. If the answer is "no," the alternate will be excused and the jury returned to consider its verdict. If the answer is "yes," there must be a mistrial. No inquiry into the extent or nature of the deliberations is permissible. State v. Bindyke, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 608</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 521 (1975).

       Peremptory Challenge Defined.
   
   - A peremptory challenge is a challenge which may be made or omitted according to the judgment, will, or caprice of the party entitled thereto, without assigning any reason therefor, or being required to assign a reason therefor. State ex rel. Freeman v. Ponder, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 294</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 292 (1951).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Peremptory Challenges on Basis of Race Prohibited.
   
   - N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s2">
    §
   </span>
   26, proscribes peremptory challenges to jurors on the basis of race in civil cases as well as criminal cases. Jackson v. Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 584</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 416 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasons for Challenge Need Not Be Given.
   
   - A party's reason for peremptorily challenging could not be inquired into. Dupree v. Virginia Home Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 417</cite> (1885).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a Right to Select Jurors.
   
   - As in the case of challenges for cause, the right is given to challenge but such right does not constitute the right to select jurors. Ives v. Atlantic &amp; N.C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 131</cite>, 55 S.E. 74 (1906); Medlin v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 397</cite>, 57 S.E. 24 (1907).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A litigant cannot exercise more peremptory challenges than the number allowed
   
   to him by law. State ex rel. Freeman v. Ponder, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 294</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 292 (1951).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Number of Plaintiffs or Defendants Immaterial.
   
   - Whether there are one or more plaintiffs or defendants, only eight peremptory challenges to the jury on either side are allowable. Bryan v. Harrison, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 360</cite> (1877); State ex rel. Freeman v. Ponder, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 294</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 292 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a quo warranto proceeding, the general statutory right to eight peremptory challenges devolving upon the relators as all the parties on one side of the case was not annulled or impaired by their assertion that justice lay with one of the defendants or by the latter's concurrence in that assertion. State ex rel. Freeman v. Ponder, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 294</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 292 (1951).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Challenge After Acceptance.
   
   - Where a juror has been accepted it is error to permit a peremptory challenge. Dunn v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 446</cite>, 42 S.E. 862 (1902).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Transcript of Jury Voir Dire Must Be Provided to Reviewing Court.
   
   - As a rule of practice, counsel who seek to rely upon an alleged impropriety in the jury selection process must provide the reviewing court with the relevant portions of the transcript of the jury voir dire. Jackson v. Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 584</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 416 (1988).

       No Authority to Allot a Defendant More than Six Challenges.
   
   - Having found that the interests of the defendants were antagonistic, this section authorized the trial judge in his discretion to either apportion between them the eight peremptory challenges allotted to the defendants or to increase the peremptory challenges of each defendant up to a maximum of six; it did not authorize the judge to allot either defendant more than six peremptory challenges.
