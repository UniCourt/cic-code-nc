                            Waiver In Pre-Marital Agreement. - Decedent's widow was not entitled to an elective share of the decedent's estate because the express language of the parties' pre-marital agreement showed the widow voluntarily waived any right to claim a spousal elective
                            share of the decedent's separate property, and stated the agreement was binding upon and inured to the benefit of the parties and the parties' respective heirs, executors, personal representatives, successors, and assigns,
                            refuting any contention that the widow intended to retain any rights in the husband's estate. In re Estate of Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 814 S.E.2d 595 (2018).

                            thereafter reconciled and lived together until the decedent's death; thus, the surviving spouse had a right to claim an elective share under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a1As30-3.1" target="_self">G.S. 30-3.1</a></cite>                            because the waiver of inheritance rights was rescinded and canceled under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.052.html#t52s52-10.2" target="_blank">G.S. 52-10.2</a></cite> by the reconciliation of the decedent and

                            Rights Analogous to Former Right of Dower. - The rights devolving after the allocation by the commissioners of the spouse's share after a dissent (claim of elective share) is analogous to the rights which devolved upon a widow in the allocation of her
                            dower before its abolishment. Etheridge v. Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 255 S.E.2d 729 (1979), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 735</cite>, 267 S.E.2d 660

                            Limitation on Right. - Right to dissert under former provisions was limited to those cases in which provisions under the will, when added to the value of property passing outside the will as a result of the testator's death, (1) were less than the intestate
                            share, or (2) were less than one half of the net estate if neither lineal descendant nor parent survived. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Stone, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 384</cite>, 139 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            Right Not an Obligation. - The right to dissent was not an obligation to dissent. Moveover, it was a common principle of law that a surviving spouse had to elect between taking under a will and dissenting from the will, and the election of one precluded
                            the other. Tarlton v. Stidham, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 469 S.E.2d 38 (1996).

                            The phrase "lineal descendants" is generally applied not to distinguish between children of various marriages or out of wedlock, but to distinguish children from other collateral descendants, e.g., nieces and nephews. In re Estate of Edwards,

                            Adopted Children as Lineal Descendants. - Natural children of one spouse born during a previous marriage, if adopted by second spouse with the consent of their surviving natural parent, would be considered lineal descendants by the second marriage for
                            the purposes of former G.S. 30-3(b), which determined a dissenting spouse's share. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>,

                            Applying G.S. 48-23(1), children adopted must be treated legally as having been born at the time of the order of adoption; accordingly, children in question were as a matter of law born of decedent's second marriage, and were "lineal descendants by the
                            second marriage" within the intended meaning of former G.S. 30-3(b). In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>,

                            More Testamentary Freedom Allowed to Spouse with Lineal Descendants by First Marriage Only. - The real effect of former G.S. 30-3 was to allow a spouse who left a child or other lineal descendant by a previous marriage but none by the spouse who survived
                            him more testamentary freedom than he would have had otherwise. It was not for the Court of Appeals to "second guess" the General Assembly on the wisdom of this distinction. The court believed the statute was enacted in good
                            faith and it created a classification based upon real distinctions which were not unreasonable. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 164 S.E.2d 631 (1968), aff'd,

                            of two figures: (1) the aggregate value of property passing under the will and outside the will to the surviving spouse: and (2) the intestate share of the surviving spouse. Phillips v. Phillips,

                            While the legislative purpose of former G.S. 30-3(b) was not entirely clear, it was apparently passed to protect a testator's children by a former marriage against a "fortune-hunting" second or successive spouse. In re Estate of Edwards,
                            <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Former G.S. 30-3(b) was enacted for the protection of a testator's children by a former spouse, on the assumption that a second or successive spouse would not feel as compelled to provide for the stepchildren upon testator's death as would the testator
                            in his will. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 40 (1986).

                            When Former G.S. 30-3(b) was Applicable. - Former G.S. 30-3(b) was applicable when the decedent was survived by a child or lineal descendant of a former marriage, even if the decedent's will left nothing to such child or lineal descendant. Vinson v. Chappell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).

                        <p>
                            Former G.S. 30-3(b) applied to limit the share of a surviving spouse to one half the intestate share only when (1) a married person died testate survived by his spouse, (2) the surviving spouse, being entitled under former
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> to do so, dissented, (3) the surviving spouse was a "second or successive spouse," (4) no lineal descendants by the second or successive marriage
                            survived the testator, and (5) the testator was survived by lineal descendants by his former marriage. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).

                            Facts Not Considered as to Applicability of Former G.S. 30-3(b). - Whether former G.S. 30-3(b) applied did not depend at all upon such considerations as: (1) the comparative durations of the first and second marriage; (2) whether the former marriage was
                            terminated by death or by divorce; (3) the age(s) of the child or children of the former marriage at the time of the second or successive marriage; and (4) the age(s) of the child or children of the former marriage and their
                            financial status at the time of the death of the decedent. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).

                            Wife's failure to "join" in her husband's petition for adoption of her two minor children by a previous marriage in no way affected her relationship with the children and was immaterial to a determination of her husband's distributive share under former
                            G.S. 30-3(b). In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 40 (1986).

                        retained a right shall be included. In valuing property in which the decedent created a power as described in G.S. 30-3.2(3f)f., the value includes, with respect to a power, the value of the property subject to the power, and the
                        amount included in the valuation with respect to a power over the income is the value of the property that produces or produced the income; provided, however, if the power is a power over both income and property and the foregoing

                            The legislature has created a two-step process to be used when a surviving spouse attempts to dissent from a deceased spouse's will (claim an elective share): the first step is to determine if the surviving spouse has the right to dissent (to claim an
                            elective share), and the second step is to determine the consequences. In re Estate of Francis, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 101</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 150 (1990); Funk v.

                            and created a vested property right in the dissenting spouse. Tighe v. Michal, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 15, 254 S.E.2d 538 (1979).

                            the dissent was filed. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).

                            Sufficiency of Marital Trust. - Where under the terms of a trust established for his wife by the testator, the trustee was required to fund the trust with assets which would give wife a life income the value of which (when added to the value of other
                            assets passing to wife under and outside the will) would be equal to her intestate share, and there were no allegations or evidence that the assets of the estate were insufficient to meet this requirement, the marital trust
                            established for wife was not insufficient, as a matter of law, to defeat her right of dissent under former law. In re Estate of Finch, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 389 S.E.2d 126

                            Surviving Spouse Held to Have No Right to Dissent. - Under prior statutes, where surviving spouse under will received all of his deceased wife's personal property and, outside the will, received real property owned by the entireties, which was all the
                            real property, he had no right to dissent, because he received everything that he would have received had his wife died without a will. In re Estate of Francis, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 101</cite>,

                            ample opportunity to prepare for a hearing on the question of the spouse's statutory right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>. In

                            Former G.S. 30-2 was a statute of limitation, not an enabling statute. The period provided a widow to dissent from her husband's will was not a condition precedent to that right, but merely limited the time in which she could resort to the courts to enforce
                            it. Whitted v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 81</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 263 (1957); Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 357</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 506 (1980).

                            Former G.S. 30-2 was a statute of limitations. It extinguished no right, but limited the time in which a widow could enforce the right the law gave her to participate in her husband's estate. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Willis,

                            Filing Procedure Not Determinative of Right. - The filing procedure prescribed by former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a1As30-3.4ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 30-3.4(a)</a></cite> was merely a limitation on the time within which

                            as of the date of the death of the deceased spouse or it never arose. Tighe v. Michal, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 15, 254 S.E.2d 538 (1979).

                            the widow was not barred by the statute of limitations in former G.S. 30-2, but could bring the action through a guardian as within three years after the disability was removed pursuant to

                            the amount of the net estate had to be determined within limits which would permit the court to ascertain with substantial accuracy whether the value of the intestate share of the surviving spouse was less or greater than the

                            of establishing the right of dissent and mandated that the value so determined be used exclusively for that purpose, indicated that the General Assembly anticipated a variance between this valuation and the ultimate distributive

                        Family settlement agreements are favored by the law; however, such an agreement is invalid unless all who receive under the will join in the agreement. In re Estate of Outen, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 818, 336 S.E.2d
                        436 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 377</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 896 (1986).

                        Alleged agreement between widow and estate was not a "family settlement agreement," where it was never executed by all of the beneficiaries under the will. In re Estate of Outen, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 818, 336
                        S.E.2d 436 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 377</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 896 (1986).

                        Release of Right Held Effective. - Although husband's release did not enumerate the statutory right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, where it did release "all
                        rights or claims of curtesy, inheritance, descent, and distribution and all other rights or claims growing out of the marital relationship between the parties . . . [and] all rights in the estate of the said wife, real, personal
                        and mixed, now owned or hereafter acquired by her," this full and final settlement of such rights encompassed the unenumerated statutory right of dissent under former statute.

                        Release Held Not Rescinded by Resumption of Cohabitation. - Where husband and wife's combined separation agreement and property settlement expressly provided that in the event of resumption of cohabitation by the parties the separation agreement and property
                        settlement would remain in full force and effect, and there was no other evidence of rescission, the couple's reconciliation prior to the wife's death did not imply a rescission of husband's release of his right to dissent under

                    Every surviving spouse of an intestate or of a testator, whether or not the surviving spouse has petitioned for an elective share, shall, unless the surviving spouse has forfeited the surviving spouse's right thereto, as provided by law, be entitled,
                    out of the personal property of the deceased spouse, to an allowance of the value of sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) for the surviving spouse's support for one year after the death of the deceased spouse. The surviving spouse may
                    claim the allowance if, at the death of the decedent, either the decedent or the surviving spouse was a resident of this State. Such allowance shall be exempt from any lien, by judgment or execution, acquired against the property of
                    the deceased spouse, and shall, in cases of testacy, be charged against the share of the surviving spouse.

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 2013-81, s. 3, made the amendment to this section by Session Laws 2013-81, s. 1, applicable to estates of persons dying on or after January 1, 2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2018-40, s. 9.1, which amended this section, is located in Part IX of Session Laws 2018-40. Section 9.2 of that act provides, "This section becomes effective January 1, 2019, and applies to allowance applications made on or after that date."
                    The reference to "This section" in Section 9.2 appears to have been in error and "This Part" was apparently the intended wording. Section 15 of the act provides that, except as otherwise provided, the act is effective when it becomes
                    law.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2019-113, s. 7, made the second sentence, as added by Session Laws 2019-113, s. 3, effective July 11, 2019, and applicable to decedents dying, estates filed, and pleadings filed on or after that date.

       Effect of Amendments.
      </b> - Session Laws 2009-183, s. 1, effective January 1, 2010, and applicable to estates of individuals dying on or after that date, substituted "twenty thousand dollars ($20,000)" for "ten thousand dollars ($10,000)," and made
                    gender neutral changes in the first sentence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2011-344, s. 7, effective January 1, 2012, and applicable to estates of decedents dying on or after that date, in the first sentence, substituted "whether or not the surviving spouse" for "whether or not he or she" and "the surviving spouse's"
                    for "his or her."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2018-40, s. 9.1, substituted "sixty thousand dollars ($60,000)" for "thirty thousand dollars ($30,000)" in the first sentence. For effective date and applicability, see editor's note.

                        Purely Statutory Right. - The right of a widow to a year's support is purely statutory. Broadnax v. Broadnax, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 432</cite>, 76 S.E. 216 (1912). See Drewry v. Raleigh Sav. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,

                    <p>
                        Legislative Intent. - The North Carolina Legislature intentionally did not impose a notice requirement with respect to the statutory right to a year's allowance. In re Estate of Archibald, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite>                        274, 644 S.E.2d 264 (2007).

                    <p>
                        If the wife dies intestate, the husband has the same right as a widow. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Melvin, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 255</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 387 (1963).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under this section as rewritten, for the first time in our law a husband may be entitled to a year's allowance. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Melvin, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 255</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 387 (1963).

                    <p>
                        Allowance Is Not "Intestate Share". - The year's allowance for the surviving spouse under the provisions of this section is not a part of the "intestate share" passing to a surviving spouse under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html" target="_blank">Chapter 29</a></cite>                        of the General Statutes, known as the Intestate Succession Act.

                    <p>
                        A widow who has dissented from her husband's will takes her year's allowance in addition to her statutory share in his estate. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Melvin, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 255</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 387 (1963).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The phrase "and shall, in cases of testacy, be charged against the share of the surviving spouse," refers only to the share of a widow who takes in accordance with the will and has not dissented from it. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Melvin,
                        <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 255</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 387 (1963).

                    <p>
                        Priority over Creditors. - The widow is given her right to a year's support against all general creditors, but no better title to the property assigned her than her husband had. She is entitled to her year's allowance in preference to the special lien
                        acquired by an execution bearing teste prior to the husband's death. In regard to other liens and equities, she takes the property in the same manner and plight in which her husband held it. Williams v. Jones,
                        <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. 504</cite> (1886).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Widow's priority extends over funeral expenses and costs of administration. Denton v. Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 542</cite>, 24 S.E. 116 (1896).

                    <p>
                        Mortgage Registered after Husband's Death. - Where a husband mortgaged a horse, but the mortgage was not registered until after his death, and prior to its registration the horse was assigned to the widow as a part of her year's support, it was held that
                        the widow took the property subject to the mortgage lien. Williams v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. 504</cite> (1886); Coastal Sales Co. v. Weston, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 621</cite>, 97 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Will Cannot Deprive Surviving Spouse of Allowance. - The General Assembly did not intend that if the testator left a will under the terms of which the surviving spouse received nothing from his personal property, that the spouse was deprived of an allowance.
                        In re Estate of Brown, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 251 S.E.2d 905 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The General Assembly did not intend that if the deceased left a will under the terms of which the surviving spouse received only what she would have received by law as her own property, that the surviving spouse is deprived of an allowance from the deceased's
                        personal property. In re Estate of Brown, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 251 S.E.2d 905 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where the decedent left a will under the terms of which his surviving spouse did not receive any legacy from his personal property, she could take her allowance out of his personal property, which would not include the proceeds from an insurance policy
                        or her share of a joint bank account. In re Estate of Brown, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 251 S.E.2d 905 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Proceeds from Joint Bank Account Are Not Personal Property of Decedent. - Proceeds from a joint bank account were paid to a surviving spouse under the terms of the contract setting up the account, and were her property and not the "personal property of
                        the deceased spouse." In re Estate of Brown, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 251 S.E.2d 905 (1979).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Deduction of Year's Allowance from Widow's Distributive Share Proper. - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a04s30-27" target="_self">G.S. 30-27</a></cite> merely outlined an alternative procedural method to pursue larger allowances
                        in superior court and should, in all other ways, have been treated in like manner with allowances administered pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a04s30-15" target="_self">G.S. 30-15</a></cite>; there was no error in a
                        trial court's order charging the year's allowance paid to the decedent's widow against the widow's distributive share. Bryant v. Bowers, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 338, 641 S.E.2d 855 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Proceeds from Insurance Policy Are Not Personal Property of Decedent. - Proceeds from an insurance policy were paid to a surviving spouse in accordance with her rights under the insurance contract, and was not the "personal property of the deceased spouse."
                        In re Estate of Brown, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 251 S.E.2d 905 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Award under Will as Estoppel. - Where the widow and the executor by mutual consent selected three men to lay off to the widow her year's support, provided for her in the husband's will, which was done, and both parties assented to the report in writing,
                        it was held that the widow in the absence of fraud and undue influence was estopped by the award and cannot maintain a proceeding under this section. Flippin v. Flippin, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 376</cite>,
                        23 S.E. 321 (1895).

                    <p>
                        Antenuptial Contract as a Bar. - A widow is barred from recovering a year's support by an antenuptial contract relinquishing all claim to any property of her husband. Perkins v. Brinkley, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 86</cite>,
                        45 S.E. 465 (1903); In re Estate of Cline, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 83, 404 S.E.2d 178 (1991).

                        When Husband Dies a Citizen of Another State. - It has been held that the widow of a man who dies a citizen of another state is not entitled to a year's support out of the assets of the decedent in this State, and the fact that she became a citizen of
                        this State after her husband's death is immaterial, since her relations to the estate and her right to share in it are fixed at the intestate's death, and by the laws of his domicile. Simpson v. Cureton,

                        A widow whose husband died domiciled in another state is entitled to her year's support in this State in which there is a fund due her husband, if the widow is a bona fide resident in the State. The reason given for this ruling is that the fiction of
                        personal property being considered as belonging to the domicile of the owner applies only to the distribution of the assets of the one deceased, and has no application to payment of debts, legacies, costs of administration, etc.

        Agreement to Satisfy Allowance Proper.

                    Whenever any parent dies survived by any child under the age of 18 years, including an adopted child or a child with whom the widow may be pregnant at the death of her husband, or a child who is less than 22 years of age and is a full-time student in
                    any educational institution, or a child under 21 years of age who has been declared mentally incompetent, or a child under 21 years of age who is totally disabled, or any other person under the age of 18 years residing with the deceased
                    parent at the time of death to whom the deceased parent or the surviving parent stood in loco parentis, every such child shall be entitled to receive an allowance of five thousand dollars ($5,000) for the child's support for the year
                    next ensuing the death of the parent. The allowance shall be in addition to the child's share of the deceased parent's estate and shall be exempt from any lien by judgment or execution against the property of the deceased parent. The
                    personal representative of the deceased parent shall, within one year after the parent's death, assign to every such child the allowance herein provided for; but if there is no personal representative or if the personal representative
                    fails or refuses to act within 10 days after written application by a guardian or next friend on behalf of the child, the allowance may be assigned by a magistrate or clerk of court upon application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the child resides with the surviving spouse of the deceased parent at the time the allowance is paid, the allowance shall be paid to the surviving spouse for the benefit of the child. If the child resides with its surviving parent who is other than
                    the surviving spouse of the deceased parent, the allowance shall be paid to the surviving parent for the use and benefit of the child. The payment shall be made regardless of whether the deceased died testate or intestate or whether
                    the surviving spouse petitioned for an elective share under Article 1A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.030.html" target="_blank">Chapter 30</a></cite> of the General Statutes. Provided, however,
                    the allowance shall not be available to a deceased father's child born out of wedlock, unless the deceased father has recognized the paternity of the child by deed, will, or other paper-writing, or unless the deceased father died prior
                    to or within one year after the birth of the child and is established to have been the father of the child by DNA testing. If the child does not reside with a surviving spouse or a surviving parent when the allowance is paid, the allowance
                    shall be paid to the child's general guardian or guardian of the estate, if any, and if none, to the clerk of the superior court who shall receive and disburse the allowance for the benefit of the child.

                    personal property of the estate shall be insufficient for such support, the clerk of superior court shall enter judgment against the personal representative for the amount of such deficiency, to be paid when a sufficiency of such assets

                    <p>
                        Meaning of Annual Net Income. - The provision of this section that the allowance shall not exceed "the one half of the [average] annual net income of the deceased for three years next preceding his death" means the one half of one year's net income, determined
                        by the average annual income for the three years next preceding the decease, and not one half of the sum total of the annual net income for the three-year period. Holland v. Henson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 742</cite>,
                        128 S.E. 145 (1925).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Net income" in this section is not "adjusted gross income," but rather is to be computed after deducting all federal and state income taxes attributable to the income received by the decedent during the three years preceding his death. Pritchard v. First-Citizens
                        Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Net income in this section means "take home pay" or "after-tax income," because this is the only income that is "netted," that is truly available for family support purposes in a real sense, as any employee whose earnings are subject to withholding can
                        testify. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Sufficient Allowance to Maintain Standard of Living. - This section is designed to permit the allowance to the surviving spouse of a solvent decedent of an amount sufficient to maintain for a period that standard of living to which he or she had been
                        accustomed, thereby avoiding the hardship which an immediate and drastic reduction in income would entail. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489,
                        248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the larger allowance authorized by this Part appears to be to provide the surviving spouse of a solvent decedent with a level of support commensurate with the support which he or she would have had from the deceased spouse during the first
                        year after the spouse's death had the death not occurred. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The legislature by this section intended the widow to receive an allotment not exceeding one half of the income which would probably have been actually received by and available to her deceased husband for the support of his family, had he lived an additional
                        year. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Allowance May Be Less Than Prescribed Maximum. - The formula in this section serves only to calculate the maximum allowance which may be assigned and does not represent an amount which must be assigned. The only requirement laid down by this section is
                        that the allowance be, within the maximum limit specified, "a value sufficient for the support of plaintiff according to the estate and condition of the decedent." In some cases, this amount could be considerably less than the
                        statutorily prescribed maximum. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Approval of Allowance Less Than Maximum. - Where the superior court found a sum which a widow has agreed to accept to be reasonable and proper, though less than her maximum allowance would have been if calculated under this section,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a04s30-27" target="_self">G.S. 30-27</a></cite> gives the court the jurisdiction to make the allowance agreed upon. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 454</cite>,
                        67 S.E.2d 651 (1951).

                    <p>
                        Allowance Sustained Where Discretion Not Abused. - Where the estate of the deceased husband is large and in good condition, and he received a net annual income for three years prior to his death of over $38,500, an allowance of $12,500 for a year's support
                        to his widow with minor son, less the value of the household furniture, is not an abuse of the superior court's discretion which the Supreme Court will review. Drewry v. Raleigh Sav. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 664</cite>, 92 S.E. 593 (1917).

        Agreement to Satisfy Allowance Proper.
       </b> - Trial court properly allowed an estate's motion to satisfy the deficiency judgment awarded to the surviving spouse for her statutory allowance out of the surplus proceeds from the sale of real property because the
                        parties expressly agreed that the estate would pay the deficiency judgment from the surplus sale proceeds; the law did not prohibit the creation and recognition of a private contractual claim to such proceeds where all other debts
                        of the estate had been satisfied. In re Estate of Giddens, - N.C. App. - , 841 S.E.2d 302 (2020).
