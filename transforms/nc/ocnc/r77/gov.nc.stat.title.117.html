       To have authority to call upon the Utilities Commission of the State to fix such rates and service charges as will be necessary to accomplish the purpose, and the right to petition the Utilities Commission to require extension of lines by the power companies when, in its opinion, it is proper and feasible.
      </li>
      <li id="t117a01s117-2ol17">
       To have the power of eminent domain for the purpose of condemning rights-of-way for the erection of transmission and distribution lines, either in its own name, or in its own name on behalf of the electric membership corporations to be formed as provided by law.

       Fee imposed. - It is the policy of the State of North Carolina to provide fair regulation of electric and telephone membership corporations in the interest of the public. The cost of regulating electric and telephone membership corporations is a burden incident to the privilege of operating as an electric or telephone membership corporation. Therefore, for the purpose of defraying the cost of regulating electric and telephone membership corporations, every electric and telephone membership corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Authority shall pay a quarterly regulatory fee, in addition to all other fees and taxes, as provided in this section. The fees collected shall be used only to pay the expenses of the Authority in regulating electric and telephone membership corporations in the interest of the public.
      </li>
      <li id="t117a01s117-3.1ol1b">
       Rate. - For each fiscal year, the regulatory fee shall be the greater of the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t117a01s117-3.1ol1b1">
         The rate established by the General Assembly for that year for each electric membership corporation's North Carolina meter connected for service and each telephone membership corporation's North Carolina access line connected for service for each quarter of the year.
        </li>
        <li id="t117a01s117-3.1ol1b2">
         Four cents (4›) for each electric membership corporation's North Carolina meter connected for service and for each telephone membership corporation's North Carolina access line connected for service for each quarter of the year.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t117a01s117-3.1ol1c">
       When Due. - The regulatory fee imposed under this section is due and payable to the Authority on or before the 15th day of the second month following the end of each quarter. Every electric and telephone membership corporation subject to the regulatory fee shall, on or before the date the fee is due for each quarter, prepare and render a report on a form prescribed by the Authority. The report shall state the electric or telephone membership corporation's total North Carolina electric meters or North Carolina telephone access lines connected for service for the preceding quarter and shall be accompanied by any supporting documentation that the Authority may by rule require.
      </li>
      <li id="t117a01s117-3.1ol1d">
       Use of Proceeds. - A special fund in the office of the State Treasurer, the North Carolina Rural Electrification Authority Fund (NCREA Fund), is created. The fees collected pursuant to this section and all other funds received by the Authority shall be deposited in the NCREA Fund. The NCREA Fund shall be placed in an interest bearing account and any interest or other income derived from the NCREA Fund shall be credited to the NCREA Fund. Moneys in the NCREA Fund shall only be spent pursuant to an appropriation by the General Assembly.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      When the Authority prepares its budget request for the upcoming fiscal year, the Authority shall propose a rate for the regulatory fee. For fiscal years beginning in an odd-numbered year, that proposed rate shall be included in the budget message the Governor submits to the General Assembly pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143C.html#t143Ca03s143C-3-5" target="_blank">G.S. 143C-3-5</a></cite>. For fiscal years beginning in an even-numbered year, that proposed rate shall be included in a special budget message the Governor shall submit to the General Assembly. If the General Assembly decides to set the regulatory fee at a rate higher than the rate in subdivision (2) of this subsection, it shall set the regulatory fee by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The regulatory fee may not exceed the amount necessary to generate funds sufficient to defray the estimated cost of the operations of the Authority for the upcoming fiscal year, including a reasonable margin for a reserve fund. The amount of the reserve may not exceed the estimated cost of operating the Authority for the upcoming fiscal year. In calculating the amount of the reserve, the General Assembly shall consider all relevant factors that may affect the cost of operating the Authority or a possible unanticipated increase or decrease in North Carolina electric meters and North Carolina telephone access lines.
     </p>
     <p>
      The NCREA Fund shall be subject to the provisions of the State Budget Act except that no unexpended surplus of the NCREA Fund shall revert to the General Fund. All funds credited to the NCREA Fund shall be used only to pay the expenses of the Authority in regulating electric and telephone membership corporations in the interest of the public as provided by this Chapter.

       Electric membership corporations may form, organize, acquire, hold, dispose of, and operate any interest up to and including full controlling interest in separate business entities that provide energy services and products, telecommunications services and products, water, and wastewater collection and treatment, so long as those other business entities meet all of the following conditions:
       <ol>
        <li id="t117a02s117-18.1ol1a1">
         They are not financed with loans or grants from the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the USDA or with similar financing from any successor agency. This limitation shall not apply to RUS or USDA loans or grants, or loans or grants from successor agencies, for water or wastewater collection and treatment projects.

         They fully compensate the electric membership corporation for the use of personnel, services, equipment, or tangible and intangible property, the greater of (i) a competitive price, which is a price comparable with prices generally being charged at the time in arms length transactions in the same market, or (ii) the electric membership corporation's fully distributed costs, which shall include all direct and indirect costs, including cost of capital incurred in providing the personnel, services, equipment, tangible property, or intangible property in question. The value of real property shall include the intangible value of not having to purchase the real property being used, and the value of the identification with the EMC that will exist because of the use of the particular real property. Should the Utilities Commission, upon complaint showing reasonable grounds for investigation, find after investigation, that the charges for those transactions between the electric membership corporation and the other business entity do not conform with the provisions of this subdivision, the Utilities Commission is empowered to direct the electric membership corporation to adjust those charges to comply with the provisions of this subdivision. If the electric membership corporation does not comply with the Utilities Commission's directive, then the Utilities Commission is empowered to direct the electric membership corporation to divest its interest in the other business entity. For purposes of enforcing this subdivision, members of the Utilities Commission, the Utilities Commission staff, and the Public Staff are authorized to inspect the books and records of such other business entities and the electric membership corporations. The Utilities Commission shall have the authority to adopt rules and reporting requirements to enforce this subdivision. The provisions of G.S. 62-310(a), 62-311, 62-312, 62-313, 62-314, 62-315, 62-316, 62-326, and 62-327 shall apply to electric membership corporations with respect to the application of this subdivision.

   <span class="s2">
    §
   </span>

       Name of the Special Act, set out its purpose, To Declare Cape Hatteras Electric Membership Corporation (CHEMC) To Be A Public Agency And Provide That It Shall Be Exempt From Certain Taxation, and it was only logical to surmise that the North Carolina legislature intended for CHEMC to continue to have public agency status, and, therefore continue to be excluded from certain taxation, namely franchise and ad valorem taxes; when read in para material with other bills contained in the Territorial Act, it becomes clear that CHEMC was to retain the same tax exempt status it enjoyed prior to the 1965 amendment to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t117a02s117-19" target="_self">G.S. 117-19</a></cite>.

       Any easement owned, held, or otherwise used by an electric membership corporation for the purpose of electrification, as stated in G.S. 117-10 may also be used by the corporation, or its wholly owned subsidiary, for the ancillary purpose of supplying high-speed broadband service, where such use does not require additional construction and is ancillary to the electrification purposes for which broadband fiber is or was installed. Nothing in this subsection shall affect, abrogate, or eliminate in any way any obligation of the corporation or its wholly owned subsidiary to comply with any applicable requirements related to notice, safety, or permitting when constructing or maintaining lines or broadband fiber on, over, under, or across property owned or operated by a railroad company.

Evidence of revenues or profits derived or the rental value of an assembled communications corridor shall not be admissible in determining fair market value. A property owner's actual damages shall be fixed at the time of the initial trespass and shall not be deemed to continue, accumulate, or accrue. Upon payment of damages, the corporation or its wholly owned subsidiary shall be granted a permanent easement for the trespass that was the subject of the claim.
