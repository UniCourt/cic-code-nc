       Where Prisoner Was Found Guilty on Three Indictments.
   
   - There were three indictments against a prisoner to one of which he pleaded guilty, and judgment was suspended on the payment of costs, and he was found guilty on the other two, on one of which he was sentenced to imprisonment for ten days. After remaining in jail for the term of his imprisonment and twenty days additional, the prisoner took the oath prescribed and applied for his discharge; it was held, that he was entitled to his discharge in all three cases.

       Insolvent's Application Is Proceeding in Cause in Which Convicted.
   
   - The application of an insolvent confined for the nonpayment of costs is a proceeding in the cause in which he was convicted, and should be made by petition to the court wherein the judgment against him was entered. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 451</cite>, 1 S.E. 776 (1887).

      <p>
       Prisoner May Appeal to Judge If Clerk Refuses to Give Oath.
   
   - If the clerk should refuse to allow the prisoner to take the oath, the remedy is by an appeal to the judge holding the courts of that district. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 451</cite>, 1 S.E. 776 (1887), intimating that release of prisoner on writ of habeas corpus by judge of adjoining district is irregular.

      <p>
       Twenty-Day Provision Is Mandatory.
   
   - Whether a defendant has property or not, he must remain in jail the twenty days, or pay the fine and costs, since the officers could not waive the imprisonment, nor had the judge the power to dispense with it. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 610</cite> (1880).

They, in plain, strong terms, embrace any such arrest made or ordered to be made in any action whatever - that is, an action in which a person - a party - may be so arrested. Burgwyn v.

A provisional release under this section shall not constitute a discharge of the debtor, and the creditor may oppose the discharge by suggesting fraud even if he has unsuccessfully attempted to oppose the provisional release on the basis of fraudulent concealment. The debtor may be provisionally released even though actual service upon the creditor has not been accomplished if 72 hours has passed since the debtor delivered the notice to the sheriff for service upon the creditor.

     <p>
      Every debtor entitled under the provisions of this chapter to discharge as an insolvent may, at the time of filing his application for a discharge or at any time afterwards, tender to the sheriff or other officer having his body in charge, a bond, with sufficient surety, in double the amount of the sum due any creditor or creditors at whose suit he was taken or charged, conditioned for the appearance of such debtor before the court where his petition is filed, at the hearing thereof, and to stand to and abide by the final order or decree of the court in the case. If such bond be satisfactory to the sheriff, he shall forthwith release such debtor from custody.

     <p>
      When any debtor is actually confined within the walls of a prison, on an order of arrest in default of bail or otherwise, the jailer must furnish him with necessary food during his confinement, if the prisoner requires it, for which the jailer shall have the same fees as for keeping other prisoners. If the debtor is unable to discharge such fees, the jailer may recover them from the party at whose instance the debtor was confined. And at any time after the arrest, the sheriff or jailer may give notice thereof to the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, and demand security of him for the prison fees that accrue after such notice, and if the plaintiff fails to give such security then the sheriff may discharge the debtor out of custody.

   - Where a man had been arrested and the issue had been continued from term to term, and his sureties had from time to time surrendered him and the issue had been decided against him and he had been committed to prison in all these cases, at the instance of the creditor, it was held that under this section the creditor was responsible to the jailer for his fees or allowance for the food furnished to the prisoner during the whole time he was confined in jail.

      <p>
       Where Prison Bounds Allowed.
   
   - When a debtor is committed to prison, and is permitted to take the prison bounds, the jailer is not under any obligation, while he continues in the bounds, to furnish him provisions for his support, nor, of course, can the creditor, at whose suit he is confined, be compelled to reimburse the jailer for any sum so expended.
