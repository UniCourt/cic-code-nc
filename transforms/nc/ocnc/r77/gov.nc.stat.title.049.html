     <p>
      Any parent who willfully neglects or who refuses to provide adequate support and maintain his or her child born out of wedlock shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.

          Some of the cases cited below were decided under the law pertaining to children born out of wedlock as it stood prior to its revision by Public Laws 1933, c. 228.

        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutionality.
   
   - This section does not violate due process of law or impose imprisonment but by the law of the land. State v. Spillman, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 271</cite>, 186 S.E. 322 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose.
   
   - The object of the Bastardy Act was to shift the burden of maintaining the child from the innocent many to the guilty one. State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. 350</cite> (1849).
       </p>
       <p>
        The sole aim of the proceeding is to ascertain the paternity of the child, to impose upon the father the burden of its support, such as he would incur if it were his lawful instead of his illegitimate offspring, and to save the county the expense of the child's maintenance. State v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 511</cite> (1881). See also, State v. Robeson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. 46</cite> (1841); State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. 129</cite> (1853); Ward v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 79</cite> (1859); State ex rel. Clements v. Durham's Adm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 100</cite> (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary purpose of prosecution under the provisions of this section is to insure that the parent does not willfully neglect or refuse to support his or her illegitimate child. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 174 S.E.2d 8, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 188</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 756 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section is not to confer rights upon either the mother or the father, but to protect the child and to protect the State against the child's becoming a public charge. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This Article is not primarily to benefit illegitimate children,
   
   but to prevent them from becoming public charges. Jolly v. Queen, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 711</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 592 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative Purpose is Social in Nature.
   
   - The duty of a putative father to support his illegitimate child was not created primarily for the benefit of the child. The legislation is social in nature and was enacted to prevent illegitimate children from becoming public charges. The benefit to the child is incidental. Such rights as it may have must be enforced under this section and in accordance with the procedure therein prescribed. Allen v. Hunnicutt, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 49</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 18 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Limitation on Prosecutions for Failure to Support Illegitimate Children Upheld.
   
   - The three-year statute of limitations contained in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-4" target="_self">G.S. 49-4(1)</a></cite> for prosecutions under this section does not violate the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution on grounds that it prescribes a limitations period for the prosecution of persons who willfully fail to support their illegitimate children, while there is no limitations period for the prosecution under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sXIa40s14-322ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 14-322(d)</a></cite> of persons who willfully fail to support their legitimate children. State v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 290 S.E.2d 730, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 559</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 225 (1982).

        "Parent".
   
   - The word "parent" in this section and the word "parents" in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-1" target="_self">G.S. 49-1</a></cite> relate to the rights and duties of parents in respect to their children, and are in pari materia. Dellinger v. Bollinger, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 696</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 592 (1955).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Section Renders Moral Obligation Legal and Enforceable.
   
   - At common law, the father of an illegitimate child was under no legal obligation to support it. However, the father of an illegitimate child is under a natural and moral duty to support the child. This section makes this moral obligation of the father legal and enforceable, and our courts should enforce it where the father is subject to their jurisdiction. State v. Tickle, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 206</cite>, 77 S.E.2d 632 (1953), cert. denied, 346 U.S. 938, 74 S. Ct. 378, 98 L. Ed. 426 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        The natural obligation of the father to support will be enforced under the statute recognizing the obligation and imposing the duty. Burton v. Burton, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 151</cite>, 55 S.E. 71 (1906); Allen v. Hunnicutt, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 49</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 18 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        All men have a moral duty to support their children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, and this section makes this moral obligation legal and enforceable with respect to illegitimate children. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 188</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 756 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A person may be convicted for nonsupport of his illegitimate children only under this section.
   
   State v. Caudill, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 268, 314 S.E.2d 592 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecution of a parent for willful nonsupport under this section is a criminal proceeding.

        State's right to proceed under this section does not require consent of the mother
   
   or of the child, however important to its case may be the mother's cooperation as a witness. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).

        As to whether bastardy proceedings under the former law were criminal or civil
   
   in their nature, see State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. 350</cite> (1849); State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 511</cite>, 14 S.E. 741 (1892); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The old Bastardy Act was repealed in toto
   
   by Public Laws 1933, c. 228, the provisions of s. 2 that the act should not affect pending litigation or accrued actions being repugnant to the specific repealing clause of s. 9, and in a prosecution under the Act of 1933 a demurrer on the grounds that proceedings under the old Bastardy Act were then pending would be overruled. See State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 44</cite>, 179 S.E. 19 (1935), holding that the Act of 1933 was intended to cover the entire subject dealing with bastardy.

       <p>
        Proceeding Under Former Law Would Not Bar Proceeding Under Present Statute.
   
   - Bastardy proceedings against defendant under C.S., G.S. 265, et seq., repealed by Public Laws 1933, c. 228, s. 9, being civil, would not support a plea of former jeopardy in a prosecution under this and the following sections for willful failure to support an illegitimate child. State v. Mansfield, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 233</cite>, 176 S.E. 761 (1934).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Offense Punishable After Effective Date of Section Although Child Born Before.
   
   - A parent may be prosecuted under this section for willful failure to support his illegitimate child begotten and born before the effective date of the statute, the offense being the willful failure to support an illegitimate child, and it being sufficient if such willful failure occur after the effective date of the statute. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 32</cite>, 182 S.E. 723 (1935).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Time Child Was Begotten Is Immaterial.
   
   - A defendant may be prosecuted under this statute for willful failure to support his illegitimate child born after the passage of the act, even though the child was begotten before the effective date of the statute, and defendant's contention that in regard to such prosecution the statute is ex post facto cannot be sustained, since the offense is the willful failure to support the child, and the time it was begotten is immaterial. State v. Mansfield, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 233</cite>, 176 S.E. 761 (1934), followed in State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 44</cite>, 179 S.E. 19 (1935).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This Article does not require the continued life of the child as the basis for a prosecution
   
   under this section, and the death of the child does not abate or prevent a prosecution against the father of an illegitimate for his willful failure to support and maintain the child prior to its death. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Even If Blood Test Is Made Impossible.
   
   - When the death of the child makes a blood test impossible, the situation is analogous to that which occurs when an eyewitness to events constituting the basis for an indictment dies before the accused has interviewed him or taken his deposition, and it would hardly be suggested that to try the defendant after the death of that witness would deprive him of due process and that therefore the prosecution must be dismissed. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        To hold that a prosecution under this section must be dismissed when the death of the child deprives the defendant of a blood test would be to attach to the test a significance which the legislature failed to give it. Even when a blood grouping test demonstrates nonpaternity the law does not make the test conclusive of that issue. A fortiori, the absence of a test which, if made, would provide one falsely accused only an even chance to prove his nonpaternity, should not result in a dismissal of the action. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970). But see <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008.html#t08a07s8-50.1" target="_blank">G.S. 8-50.1</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-7" target="_self">G.S. 49-7</a></cite>, as to competency of blood tests.

       <p>
        Each Day Constitutes a Separate Offense.
   
   - A continuing offense is a new violation of the law. Each day during which it is continued constitutes a separate offense and will support a separate prosecution, provided the warrant or indictment alleges separate and distinct times during which the offense was committed. State v. Killian, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 155, 300 S.E.2d 257 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior Prosecution Does Not Bar Prosecution for Subsequent Offense.
   
   - Defendant was convicted and served the sentence imposed for willfully failing and refusing to support his illegitimate child under this and the following sections. After completion of his term, defendant still willfully failed and refused to support the child, and this prosecution was instituted for breach of this and the following sections subsequent to his release. Defendant entered a plea of former jeopardy. It was held that the violation of the statute constituted a continuing offense, and the prior prosecution was not a bar to a prosecution for breach of the statute for the period subsequent to defendant's release from the imprisonment imposed in the first prosecution. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 566</cite>, 194 S.E. 319 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        A new warrant may be filed charging defendant with nonsupport, if such has occurred after the issuance of the warrant on which he has been tried. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 164 S.E.2d 39 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The criminal offense of willful nonsupport of an illegitimate child by a parent of the child may be repeated, and if it is, prosecution for the subsequent offense will not be barred by the prosecution for the former offense on the theory of double jeopardy. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        A previous acquittal on a charge of willful nonsupport does not bar a subsequent prosecution, because this section creates a continuing offense. Stephens v. Worley, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 277 S.E.2d 81 (1981).

        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> Compared.
   
   - The issue of paternity is the entire thrust of the civil action under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite>, whereas the focus of the crime punishable by this section is the willful failure to pay support for an illegitimate child, not paternity, because this section does not make the mere begetting of a child a crime. Stephens v. Worley, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 277 S.E.2d 81 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Prosecution upon Subsequent Civil Proceedings to Establish Paternity.
   
   - Since the parties to a previous criminal proceeding under this section and civil proceedings under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> are not the same, and the State and the present plaintiff were not in privity, the defendant was not estopped in a civil action to deny paternity. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        A judgment of acquittal in a criminal prosecution under this section for willful failure to support two illegitimate children was not res judicata in county's civil action under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> to establish defendant's paternity of the two children, where the criminal judgment merely stated that defendant was found not guilty and did not disclose whether an acquittal was entered because the judge found that defendant was not the father of the children or because he did not believe that defendant had willfully failed to provide for their reasonable support, as there was thus no showing on the record that the issue of paternity had been previously adjudicated in defendant's favor. Stephens v. Worley, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 277 S.E.2d 81 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        General verdict of not guilty, upon charges of willful neglect and refusal to provide adequate support of an illegitimate child, did not operate as res judicata on the issue of paternity in subsequent action to establish paternity and require support of an illegitimate child. Sampson County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. McPherson v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 372 S.E.2d 340 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Liability of Nonresident Who Begot Child in Another State.
   
   - Where defendant, a resident of another state, begot an illegitimate child in such other state, and the mother moved to this State before the child was born, and the mother and child continued to reside in this State from the time of the birth, the offense of willful failure and refusal to support the child was committed in this State, and defendant was constructively in this State when the offense was committed, since he had voluntarily set in motion the chain of circumstances resulting in the commission of the offense here, and therefore the courts of this State had jurisdiction of the offense. State v. Tickle, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 206</cite>, 77 S.E.2d 632 (1953), cert. denied, 346 U.S. 938, 74 S. Ct. 378, 98 L. Ed. 426 (1954), commented on in 32 N.C.L. Rev. 435 (1954).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction.
   
   - The district court has exclusive original jurisdiction of misdemeanors, including actions to determine liability of persons for the support of dependents in any criminal proceeding. Cline v. Cline, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 170 S.E.2d 645 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Violation of this section is a misdemeanor over which the district court has exclusive original jurisdiction. Until a defendant is tried and convicted of this offense in district court and appeals to the superior court for a trial de novo, the superior court has no jurisdiction. State v. Caudill, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 268, 314 S.E.2d 592 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        As to sufficiency of summons issued under this section,
   
   see State v. Walton, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 254 S.E.2d 661 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Counsel.
   
   - For cases formerly holding that a defendant charged under this section was not entitled to appointed counsel as the charge did not involve a serious offense, see State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 188</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 756 (1970); Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for willful failure to support an illegitimate child, the defendant had a constitutional right to be represented by counsel at his trial unless he knowingly and intelligently waived that right, since violation of this section can result in imprisonment. State v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 165, 252 S.E.2d 225 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Punishment.
   
   - The only punishment authorized by law for the willful failure or neglect to support an illegitimate child is found in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-8" target="_self">G.S. 49-8</a></cite> and is limited at most to six months in prison. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 188</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 756 (1970).

         II. ELEMENTS OF OFFENSE.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Elements of Offense, Generally.
   
   - For a defendant to be found guilty of the criminal offense created by this section, two facts must be established: first, that the defendant is a parent of the illegitimate child in question, who must be a person coming within the definition of a child as set forth in this section; and second, that the defendant has willfully neglected or refused to support and maintain such illegitimate child. In addition, if the defendant is the reputed father, it must be shown that the prosecution has been instituted within one of the time periods provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-4" target="_self">G.S. 49-4</a></cite>. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 164 S.E.2d 39 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the provisions of this section the State must establish two facts in order for the defendant to be found guilty: (1) That the defendant is the parent of the illegitimate child in question and (2) that the defendant has willfully neglected or refused to support and maintain such illegitimate child. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 174 S.E.2d 8, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 188</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 756 (1970); State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 181 S.E.2d 186 (1971); State v. Soloman, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 253 S.E.2d 270 (1979); State v. Lambert, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 799, 281 S.E.2d 754 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution under this section, the State must prove two things: (1) that the defendant is indeed the parent of the child and (2) that defendant has intentionally neglected or refused to provide reasonable support for the child. Stephens v. Worley, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 277 S.E.2d 81 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement that a parent "support and maintain his or her illegitimate child"
   
   within the purview of this section is not restricted merely to providing food. It includes the supplying of food, clothing and other necessaries, together with medical assistance reasonably required for the preservation of the health of the child. And this obligation to the child applies even in the case of the newly born baby. State v. Love, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 283</cite>, 77 S.E.2d 501 (1953).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere begetting of an illegitimate child is not a crime.
   
   State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 164 S.E.2d 39 (1968); State v. Ingle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 200 S.E.2d 427 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The only "prosecution" contemplated by this legislation is that grounded on the willful neglect or refusal of any parent to support and maintain his or her illegitimate child, the mere begetting of the child not being denominated a crime. State v. Dill, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 57</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 145 (1944); State v. Stiles, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 137</cite>, 44 S.E.2d 728 (1947); State v. Coppedge, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 590</cite>, 94 S.E.2d 569 (1956); State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 10</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 126 (1956); State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        As the criminal offense is not committed by begetting but by willful nonsupport
   
   of the child. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>

        Prosecution Is Grounded on Willful Neglect or Refusal to Support Child.
   
   - The only prosecution contemplated under this section is that grounded on the willful neglect or refusal of a parent to support his or her illegitimate child. State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 653</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 246 (1962); State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 164 S.E.2d 39 (1968); State v.

        Question of paternity is incidental to the prosecution
   
   for nonsupport. State v. Bowser, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 330</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 282 (1949); State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 345</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 157 (1951); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The question of paternity is merely incidental to the prosecution for nonsupport and involves no punishment. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 188</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 756 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Paternity Is Preliminary Requisite.
   
   - The question of paternity is incidental to the prosecution for the crime of nonsupport - a preliminary requisite to conviction. State v. Coffey, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 164 S.E.2d 39 (1968); Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Willfulness Is Essential Element of Offense.
   
   - Willfulness is an essential element in the crime of failure and refusal to support an illegitimate child. State v. McDay, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 388</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 86 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        The father of an illegitimate child may be convicted of neglecting to support such child only when it is established that such neglect was willful, that is, without just cause, excuse or justification. The willfulness of the neglect is an essential ingredient of the offense, and as such must not only be charged in the bill, but must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption of innocence with which the defendant enters the trial includes the presumption of innocence of willfulness in any failure on his part to support his illegitimate child. The failure to support may be an evidential fact tending to show a willful neglect, but it does not raise a presumption of willfulness. State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 261</cite>, 176 S.E. 757 (1934); State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 10</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 126 (1956); State v. McCoy, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 363</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 788 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Which Must Be Charged in Warrant or Indictment.
   
   - Under this section, the neglect or refusal to support an illegitimate child must be willful, and it must be so charged in the warrant or bill of indictment, and the omission of such allegation is fatal. State v. Vanderlip, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 610</cite>, 35 S.E.2d 885 (1945); State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 414</cite>, 38 S.E.2d 166 (1946); State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 743</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 914 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        The warrant in a prosecution under this and the following sections must allege that the failure or refusal of defendant to support his illegitimate child was willful, and where it does not do so, defendant's motion in arrest of judgment should be allowed. State v. McLamb, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 322</cite>, 199 S.E. 81 (1938). See State v. Tarleton, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 734</cite>, 182 S.E. 481 (1935); State v. Clarke, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 392</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 468 (1941); State v. Sturdivant, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 535</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 661 (1941); State v. Coppedge, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 590</cite>, 94 S.E.2d 569 (1956); State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 118</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 442 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Proved Beyond Reasonable Doubt.
   
   - The willfulness of the neglect is an essential ingredient of the offense, and as such must not only be charged in the bill, but must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Spillman, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 271</cite>, 186 S.E. 322 (1936); State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 743</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 914 (1953).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Willful" Defined.
   
   - The word "willfully," as used in the statute, is used with the same import as in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sXIa40s14-322" target="_blank">G.S. 14-322</a></cite>, relating to willful abandonment of wife (now spouse). State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 261</cite>, 176 S.E. 757 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "willful," as used in this section, means that the act is done purposely and deliberately in violation of the law; it means an act done without any lawful justification, reason or excuse. State v. Stiles, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 137</cite>, 44 S.E.2d 728 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant's willful failure and refusal to support his illegitimate child means an intentional neglect or refusal. State v. McDay, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 388</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 86 (1950).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Willful Neglect Must Follow Demand for Support.
   
   - In order to support a finding of willful nonsupport of an illegitimate child by the father, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mother of the child or, under certain circumstances, the director of social services has, after the child was born and before the prosecution was commenced, made demand upon the father for support, and after such demand and before prosecution, the father willfully neglected and refused to provide adequate support according to his means and condition and the necessities of the child. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Willfulness Not Presumed from Failure to Support.
   
   - Construing the word "willful" in light of the decided cases, it is clear that one cannot be brought within the meaning of the statute without proving the criminal intent, and that it is error for the court to charge the jury that if the defendant failed to support his illegitimate child "the presumption is he willfully did so." State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 261</cite>, 176 S.E. 757 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a father has failed to pay the child support ordered by the court, he may not be held in contempt of court and imprisoned or punished in any way until a judicial determination has been made as to whether he has failed willfully to comply; willfulness may not be presumed. State v. McCoy, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 363</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 788 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Presumption of Paternity.
   
   - To impose responsibility on a man for the support of an illegitimate child, it must first be established that he is the father of the child. The Act of 1741 created a conclusive presumption from the oath of the mother. This was modified in 1814 to make a prima facie case by the affidavit or oath of the woman. There is now no presumption from the affidavit or testimony of the mother. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 10</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 126 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden Is on State to Prove Paternity of Child and Willful Neglect.
   
   - It is not necessary that defendant's paternity of the child should first be judicially determined, but the State must prove on the trial, first, defendant's paternity of the child, and then his willful neglect or refusal to support the child. State v. Spillman, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 271</cite>, 186 S.E. 322 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the statute raises no presumption against a person accused, the State must overcome the presumption of innocence both as to the willfulness of the neglect to support the illegitimate child and defendant's paternity of the child. State v. Spillman, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 271</cite>, 186 S.E. 322 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to convict defendant under this section, the burden is on the State to show not only that he is the father of the child and that he had refused or neglected to support and maintain it, but further, that his refusal or neglect was willful, that is, intentionally done, "without just cause, excuse or justification," after notice and request for support. State v. Hayden, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 779</cite>, 32 S.E.2d 333 (1944); State v. Stiles, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 137</cite>, 44 S.E.2d 728 (1947); State v. Ellison, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 59</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 9 (1949); State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 345</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 157 (1951); State v. Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 154</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 655 (1951); State v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 373</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 209 (1953); State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 653</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 246 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is as much the duty of the State to establish willful failure to support by evidence showing that fact beyond a reasonable doubt as it is to so establish paternity. State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 653</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 246 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution under this section, the burden is upon the State upon defendant's plea of not guilty to prove not only that defendant is the father of the child and had refused or neglected to support the child, but further that his refusal or neglect was willful. State v. Mason, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 423</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 753 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Paternity Need Not Be Relitigated on Subsequent Prosecution.
   
   - Upon a prosecution for a subsequent willful neglect or refusal to support, the accused is not entitled to have the question of paternity relitigated. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964); State v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 238 S.E.2d 653 (1977), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 184</cite>, 241 S.E.2d 519 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the question of paternity has been determined, the accused is not entitled to have the question of paternity relitigated upon a subsequent prosecution for later willful neglect or refusal to support his illegitimate children. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 174 S.E.2d 8, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 188</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 756 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a subsequent prosecution of an alleged father, the question of paternity, necessarily determined against him in the previous criminal action, need not be relitigated, that question being res judicata. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Guilty Verdict as Finding of Paternity.
   
   - A general verdict of "guilty" or "guilty as charged" to a valid charge of violation of this section is adequate as a finding of paternity. State v. Golden, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 37, 251 S.E.2d 875 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A judgment as of nonsuit in a prosecution under this section does not constitute an adjudication on the issue of paternity
   
   and will not support a plea of former acquittal in a subsequent prosecution under the statute, the offense being a continuing one. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 408</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 857 (1952). See also, State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 119</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 329 (1954); State v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 766</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 197 (1956).

       <p>
        Affidavit Supporting Warrant Must Name Defendant.
   
   - Where, in the affidavit upon which a warrant charging unlawful failure to support an illegitimate child is based, the name of the defendant does not appear, then the warrant does not charge the defendant with a crime, and judgment must be arrested. State v. Satterfield, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 597, 174 S.E.2d 640 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Warrant Must Charge Him with Refusal to Support Child.
   
   - The begetting of an illegitimate child is not of itself a crime, and a warrant charging defendant with being the putative father of an unborn, illegitimate child is insufficient to support a prosecution under this statute, nor is such insufficiency cured by an amendment allowing the word "willful" to be inserted therein, in the absence of an amendment alleging the birth of the child and defendant's refusal to support the child. State v. Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 231</cite>, 180 S.E. 85 (1935). See also, State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 345</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 157 (1951); State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 408</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 857 (1952); State v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 373</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 209 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the warrant upon which defendant was tried was insufficient to charge any crime, defendant's motion in arrest of judgment should have been allowed, since the defect was one appearing on the face of the record. Thus the failure of the warrant to charge defendant with willful failure to support his illegitimate child was not cured by the charge or verdict, where the warrant failed to charge any criminal offense. State v. Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 231</cite>, 180 S.E. 85 (1935).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The charge must be supported by the facts as they existed at the time it was formally laid
   
   in the court, and cannot be supported by evidence of willful failure supervening between the time the charge was made and time of trial, at least when the trial is had upon the original warrant. State v. Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 154</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 655 (1951); State v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 373</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 209 (1953); State v. Ingle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 200 S.E.2d 427 (1973); State v. Killian, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 155, 300 S.E.2d 257 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand for Support Must Have Been Made Before Warrant Was Drawn.
   
   - Where, in a prosecution for willful neglect and refusal to support an illegitimate child, the evidence discloses that no demand for support of the child was made upon defendant until after the warrant was drawn, nonsuit must be entered, since the warrant must be supported by the facts as they existed at the time it was formally laid and cannot be supported by evidence of willful failure thereafter. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 119</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 329 (1954); State v. Ingle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 200 S.E.2d 427 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment of Warrant.
   
   - The trial court has authority to permit the prosecuting attorney to amend a warrant charging defendant with willful failure to support his illegitimate child by inserting the word "maintain," so as to charge his willful failure to support and maintain his illegitimate child. State v. Bowser, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 330</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 282 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Charging of Specific Date in Indictment.
   
   - In a prosecution for willful failure and refusal to support an illegitimate child under this and the following sections, an exception on the ground that the indictment failed to charge the specific date in the month in which the offense was alleged to have been committed cannot be sustained. State v. Oliver, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 386</cite>, 196 S.E. 325 (1938).

        Testimony of Prosecutrix That She Wrote Defendant Demanding Support for Child.
   
   - In a prosecution under this section, testimony of prosecutrix that she wrote defendant after the baby was born demanding support for it was sufficient upon that question, without introduction of the letter in evidence, since the testimony was sufficient to support the inference that the letter was written before the bill of indictment was laid. State v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 373</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 209 (1953).

       <p>
        Cross-Examination as to Failure to Make Blood Test.
   
   - It was held competent upon the trial of a prosecution under this section for the prosecuting attorney to ask defendant upon cross-examination if the reason blood test was not made was because defendant knew the baby was his, the matter being within the bounds of a fair cross-examination. The legal principles relating to the purpose and value of a blood test were not relevant upon objection to the cross-examination. State v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 373</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 209 (1953).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence Held Sufficient.
   
   - Evidence in prosecution of defendant for willful neglect or refusal to support his illegitimate child held sufficient to overrule motions to nonsuit. State v. Bowser, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 330</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 282 (1949).

        Evidence held sufficient to show failure to support at time warrant was issued. State v. Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 154</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 655 (1951).

        Instruction as to Willfulness.
   
   - Willfulness in refusal to support one's illegitimate child is an essential ingredient of the offense denounced by this section, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and instructions which fail to so charge deprive defendant of his right to have the jury consider his willfulness as an issuable fact. State v. Hayden, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 779</cite>, 32 S.E.2d 333 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution under this section, an instruction defining the term "willfully" as "wrongfully and unjustifiably, without valid and good excuse," instead of as an intentional neglect or refusal, would be held for reversible error. State v. McDay, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 388</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 86 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution under this section, an instruction that the jury was to find defendant guilty if it found from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the father of the child, without submitting the question of whether defendant willfully refused to support the child, constituted prejudicial error. State v. Mason, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 423</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 753 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Charge as to Necessity of Notice and Demand for Support.
   
   - Failure of the court to charge that there was no obligation upon defendant to support the child in question until he had been given notice that he was the father and demand was made upon him for support could not be held prejudicial where there was evidence of notice and demand prior to issuance of the warrant and the court categorically charged that the jury had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the father of the child and that he knowingly, intentionally and with stubborn and willful purpose refused to support the child before they could return a verdict of guilty. State v. Humphrey, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 608</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 479 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Submission of Interrogatories or Issues Is Virtually Necessary.
   
   - The submission of issues in prosecutions under this section is, as a practical matter, almost a necessity. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the nature and effect of the elements involved in this section, it would be difficult to properly try a case pursuant to this statute without submitting to the jury either oral interrogatories or written issues. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless Paternity Has Previously Been Determined.
   
   - If the question of paternity has been previously determined adversely to the accused, the case could well be tried solely upon the general issue of guilt. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Submission of Interrogatories or Issues Is Approved.
   
   - The submission of interrogatories or issues in criminal prosecutions under this section is now the approved practice, the questions and answers being treated as a special verdict. State v. McKee, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 280</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 204 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The practice of submitting written issues in cases charging violation of this section is strongly commended. State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 181 S.E.2d 186 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a general verdict of "guilty" or "guilty as charged" may be proper, it is not required. Indeed, the preferred practice in cases charging a violation of this section calls for the submission of written issues to the jury. State v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 320 S.E.2d 319 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A jury's verdict based on issues submitted to it should include an individual determination of four issues.
   
   First, is defendant a parent of the illegitimate child in question? Second, did defendant receive notice and demand for support? Third, did defendant willfully neglect or refuse to provide adequate support for the child? Lastly, if the answers to the preceding are yes, is defendant guilty of willful neglect or refusal to maintain and provide adequate support for his illegitimate child? Such a verdict of the jury is in the nature of a special verdict and, when attempted, must reveal that all issues of ultimate material fact have been resolved against defendant. State v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 320 S.E.2d 319 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Verdict upon Proper Issues Is Sufficient Without General Verdict of Guilty.
   
   - A verdict upon the issues of paternity and nonsupport, if resolved in favor of the State, is sufficient to support a judgment against defendant without a general verdict by the jury of guilty. This does not contravene the provisions of the North Carolina Constitution requiring trial and verdict by jury in criminal cases. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964), holding findings in special verdict deficient and granting a new trial.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A jury verdict must unambiguously state that defendant has been found guilty
   
   of a crime. State v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 320 S.E.2d 319 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A general verdict of "guilty" or "guilty as charged" is sufficient
   
   when a defendant is properly charged under this section. However, when the jury undertakes to spell out its verdict without specific reference to the charge, it is essential that the spelling be correct. State v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 320 S.E.2d 319 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Verdict Must Find Willful Nonsupport.
   
   - Willfulness is an essential element of the offense denounced by this section, and a verdict "guilty of failure to support and maintain his bastard child" was insufficient to support a judgment. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 530</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 530 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a jury finds that the accused is a parent of the child but that he has not willfully failed or refused to support the child, there can be no conviction, for no crime has been committed. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Verdict Held Insufficient.
   
   - A verdict of "guilty of willful nonsupport of illegitimate child" was insufficient in that it failed to fix the paternity of the child. State v. Ellison, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 59</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 9 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        A verdict of "guilty of the charge of bastardy" would not support a judgment in a prosecution under this section. State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 653</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 246 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the nonsupport issue submitted was, "Has the defendant . . . willfully neglected and refused to support and maintain said illegitimate child?", an affirmative answer did not supply the information as to whether demand was made, or, if made, whether it was before or after the prosecution was commenced. Because of the deficiency of the findings in the special verdict, there had to be a new trial. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        A verdict of "guilty of non-support of illegitimate child" was held improper and was set aside where it neither alluded generally to the warrant nor used specific language sufficient to show a conviction of the offense charged. State v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 320 S.E.2d 319 (1984).

       Constitutionality.
   
   - The three-year statute of limitations contained in subdivision (1) of this section for prosecutions under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-2" target="_self">G.S. 49-2</a></cite> does not violate the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution on grounds that it prescribes a limitations period for the prosecution of persons who willfully fail to support their illegitimate children, whereas there is no limitations period for the prosecution under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sXIa40s14-322ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 14-322(d)</a></cite> of persons who willfully fail to support their legitimate children. State v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 290 S.E.2d 730, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 559</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 225 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no statute of limitations as such affecting a father's duty to support
   
   his illegitimate children. That duty continues throughout the child's minority. Bertie-Hertford Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Souza v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 342 S.E.2d 579 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the inapplicability of statute limiting criminal prosecutions for misdemeanors to two years to proceedings under the former statute,
   
   see State v. Hedgepeth, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 1039</cite>, 30 S.E. 140 (1898); State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 1043</cite>, 30 S.E. 139 (1898).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section cannot be limited to proceedings to establish paternity.
   
   Its language is clear, positive and unbending. It seems to have been taken from C.S.,
   <span class="s2">
    §
   </span>
   274, of the old law, which was held to supersede the general statute of limitations on the subject. State v. Bradshaw, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 5</cite>, 197 S.E. 564 (1938).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Maximum time for prosecution was formerly six years from birth.
   
   State v. Killian, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 339</cite>, 7 S.E.2d 702 (1940).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to support an illegitimate child is a continuing offense,
   
   and the date such child was born is immaterial, provided the action is instituted within the time prescribed by this section and that demand for the support of such child was made a reasonable time before the action was instituted. State v. Womack, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 342</cite>, 111 S.E.2d 332 (1959).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A proceeding to establish paternity of an illegitimate child and to prosecute father
   
   who willfully neglects or refuses to support and maintain the same may be instituted at any time within three years after the birth of the child. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 356</cite>, 23 S.E.2d 31 (1942).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the question of paternity is judicially determined within three years
   
   after the birth of the illegitimate child, the defendant may thereafter be prosecuted for his willful neglect and refusal to support the child. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 10</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 126 (1956).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Acknowledgment Made More Than Three Years from Birth Does Not Prevent Running of Statute.
   
   - Where acknowledgment of the paternity of a child has been made by payments for its support within three years from the date of its birth, prosecution for nonsupport may be brought within three years thereafter, but a later acknowledgment, made more than three years from the birth, will not avail to prevent the running of the statute. State v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 625</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 24 (1940).

      <p>
       Proof Required Under Subdivision (3).
   
   - Where prosecution was not begun within three years after the birth, and paternity was not judicially determined within that time, the State had to meet the requirements of subdivision (3) of this section and prove not only that defendant made payments for the child's support within the three years after its birth, but also that the warrant was issued within three years from the date of the last payment.

      Proceedings under this Article may be brought by the mother or her personal representative or, if the child is likely to become a public charge, the director of social services or such person as by law performs the duties of such official in said county where the mother resides or the child is found. Proceedings under this Article may be brought in the county where the mother resides or is found, or in the county where the putative father resides or is found, or in the county where the child is found. The fact that the child was born outside of the State of North Carolina shall not be a bar to proceedings against the putative father in any county where he resides or is found, or in the county where the mother resides or the child is found. The death of the mother shall in no wise affect any proceedings under this Article. Preliminary proceedings under this Article to determine the paternity of the child may be instituted prior to the birth of the child but when the judge or court trying the issue of paternity deems it proper, he may continue the case until the woman is delivered of the child. When a continuance is granted, the courts shall recognize the person accused of being the father of the child with surety for his appearance, either at the next session of the court or at a time to be fixed by the judge or court granting a continuance, which shall be after the delivery of the child.

       Institution of Proceedings.
   
   - The provision that proceedings under this section can only be instituted by the mother or her personal representative or by the director of social services is applicable both to preliminary proceedings to determine paternity and to proceedings involving the completed crime. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 10</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 126 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The affidavit initiating the prosecution may be made by the mother or the director of social services. State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 653</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 246 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother may decide whether to call upon father for assistance.
   
   In the event that she elects not to make the demand, her election will be respected unless the child is likely to become a public charge, in which case the director of social services may proceed. State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 653</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 246 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Joining of Mother in Prosecution Is Not Required.
   
   - Prosecution of the alleged father for violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-2" target="_self">G.S. 49-2</a></cite> may be initiated by the mother, but her joining therein is not a prerequisite to the validity of the prosecution. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Continuance Until After Birth of Child.
   
   - By express statutory language preliminary proceedings to determine the paternity of a child may be initiated and determined before the birth of the child. A continuance of the proceedings until after the birth of the child rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 10</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 126 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem that in a preliminary proceeding under this section a continuance until the birth of the child would be required when a defendant requests a blood-grouping test under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-7" target="_self">G.S. 49-7</a></cite>. State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 228 S.E.2d 523 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Rights of Surety.
   
   - The surety on the appearance bond of the defendant, who, in bastardy proceedings under the former law, appealed from a justice of the peace to the county court, which remanded the cause for want of jurisdiction, could insist upon the exact terms of his bond; and where the defendant had been legally convicted and had served his term as the law provided on failing to pay the allowance made to the prosecutrix, costs, etc., the provisions in the appearance bond as to the surety's liability had been discharged. State v. Carnegie, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 467</cite>, 137 S.E. 308 (1927).

   - What kind of order should be entered where the child dies pending trial is in the discretion of the judge. The former statute seemed to require an order in every case. State v. Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 648</cite> (1872).

       Consideration for Promise of Father to Support Child.
   
   - Where the mother of an illegitimate child had refrained from enforcing maintenance thereof under the former statute, this was held to constitute consideration to support an action on a promise of the father to support and educate the child.

     <p>
      The court before which the matter may be brought shall determine whether or not the defendant is a parent of the child on whose behalf the proceeding is instituted. After this matter has been determined in the affirmative, the court shall proceed to determine the issue as to whether or not the defendant has neglected or refused to provide adequate support and maintain the child who is the subject of the proceeding. After this matter has been determined in the affirmative, the court shall fix by order, subject to modification or increase from time to time, a specific sum of money necessary for the support and maintenance of the child, subject to the limitations of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.10" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.10</a></cite>.

The order fixing the sum shall require the defendant to pay it either as a lump sum or in periodic payments as the circumstances of the case may appear to the court. The social security number, if known, of the minor child's parents shall be placed in the record of the proceeding. Compliance by the defendant with any or all of the further provisions of this Article or the order or orders of the court requiring additional acts to be performed by the defendant shall not be construed to relieve the defendant of his or her responsibility to pay the sum fixed or any modification or increase thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court before whom the matter may be brought, on motion of the State or the defendant, shall order that the alleged-parent defendant, the known natural parent, and the child submit to any blood tests and comparisons which have been developed and adapted for purposes of establishing or disproving parentage and which are reasonably accessible to the alleged-parent defendant, the known natural parent, and the child. The results of those blood tests and comparisons, including the statistical likelihood of the alleged parent's parentage, if available, shall be admitted in evidence when offered by a duly qualified, licensed practicing physician, duly qualified immunologist, duly qualified geneticist or other duly qualified person. The evidentiary effect of those blood tests and comparisons and the manner in which the expenses therefor are to be taxed as costs shall be as prescribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008.html#t08a07s8-50.1" target="_blank">G.S. 8-50.1</a></cite>.

       Right to Blood Test.
   
   - A defendant's right to a blood test to determine parentage is a substantial right, and upon defendant's motion the court must order the test when it is possible to do so. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970); State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 228 S.E.2d 523 (1976).

       The 1975 amendment to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008.html#t08a07s8-50.1" target="_blank">G.S. 8-50.1</a></cite> amplifies the importance of the right to a blood-grouping test under this section. State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 228 S.E.2d 523 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of serological blood tests,
   
   when made and interpreted by specifically qualified technicians using approved testing procedures and reagents of standard strength, is now generally recognized. Such tests, however, can never prove the paternity of any individual, and they cannot always exclude the possibility. Nevertheless, in a significant number of cases, they can disprove it. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The result of a blood test to determine parentage will be either "exclusion of paternity demonstrated" or "exclusion of paternity not possible." It has been estimated that by tests based upon each of three blood-type classifications, A-B-O, M-N, and Rh-hr, a man falsely accused has a 50-55% chance of proving his nonpaternity. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The blood-grouping test results are conclusive only in excluding the putative father.
   
   The results might show him to have a blood type which the father of the child must have had; but this only indicates that of all the people of that blood type or group, he, as well as anyone else with that blood type or group, could have been the father of the child. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).

      </p>
      <p>
       Attacking Results of Blood Tests.
   
   - The only areas in which the results of blood-grouping tests should be open to attack are in the method of testing or in the qualifications of the persons performing the tests. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).
   <br />

      <p>
       Death of Child Making Blood Test Impossible.
   
   - When the death of the child makes a blood test impossible the situation is analogous to that which occurs when an eyewitness to events constituting the basis for an indictment dies before the accused has interviewed him or taken his deposition. It would hardly be suggested that to try the defendant after the death of that witness would deprive him of due process and that therefore the prosecution must be dismissed. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970), decided prior to the 1975 amendments to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008.html#t08a07s8-50.1" target="_blank">G.S. 8-50.1</a></cite> and this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       To hold that a prosecution under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-2" target="_self">G.S. 49-2</a></cite> must be dismissed when the death of the child deprives the defendant of a blood test would be to attach to the test a significance which the legislature failed to give it. Even when a blood-grouping test demonstrates nonpaternity, the law does not make the test conclusive of that issue. A fortiori, the absence of a test, which, if made, would provide one falsely accused only an even chance to prove his nonpaternity, should not result in a dismissal of the action. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970), decided prior to the 1975 amendments to

      <p>
       Issue of Paternity Must Be Determined First.
   
   - In a prosecution for willful neglect or refusal of alleged father to support his illegitimate child, the issue of paternity must first be determined before and separate from the determination of the issue of guilt or innocence of the offense charged. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 408</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 857 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court is expressly commanded by this section to first determine the paternity of the child. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 10</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 126 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Domestic relations court was entitled to determine paternity of child, even though when the affidavit was filed and the warrant was issued the defendant had not committed the offense of willfully neglecting same, and even though the court exceeded its power in ordering the defendant to make payments, its determination of the facts as to paternity was in effect a jury verdict, and constituted a judicial declaration of the paternity of the child. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 10</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 126 (1956).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       As an affirmative answer to question of paternity is an indispensable prerequisite to defendant's conviction
   
   on the criminal charge. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976); Wilkes County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Nations v.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Paternity Must Be Established Beyond a Reasonable Doubt.
   
   - The paternity of a child cannot be established by a mere preponderance of the evidence, but must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 10</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 126 (1956).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Form of Verdict.
   
   - This section requires the court to determine, in the affirmative, first, whether or not the defendant is the parent, before it proceeds to determine whether or not defendant has willfully failed to support his or her child. For this reason, the verdict in a bastardy action should ordinarily be rendered in a special form, upon the submission of separate written issues or interrogatories, or alternatively, if a general verdict is returned, it should be accompanied by appropriate findings of fact to clarify the precise effect of the judgment. Stephens v. Worley, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 277 S.E.2d 81 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal on Issue of Parentage Where Defendant Is Acquitted on Charge of Nonsupport.
   
   - Under this section, a defendant in a prosecution for nonsupport of his illegitimate child may appeal from a verdict establishing his paternity of the child, notwithstanding the fact that the verdict finds him not guilty of nonsupport. State v. Clement, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 614</cite>, 54 S.E.2d 919 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if defendant is found not guilty of willfully neglecting or refusing to support his illegitimate child, he may nevertheless appeal an adverse finding and conclusion that he is the parent of such illegitimate child. State v. Lambert, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 799, 281 S.E.2d 754 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant Not Entitled to Appeal When Acquitted of Nonsupport.
   
   - Before the 1947 amendment, which added the proviso at the end of this section, it was held that where the jury found the defendant to be the father of the bastard child, but not guilty of nonsupport, this was an acquittal. The defendant therefore was not entitled to an appeal. State v. Hiatt, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 116</cite>, 189 S.E. 124 (1937).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Modification of Orders.
   
   - Where defendant pleaded guilty and orders were made for the support of the child, the court had no authority to strike out a plea of guilty or a judgment at a former term; but, under this section, the court could modify the conditions of the former judgment, or increase from time to time the amount necessary for the child's support. State v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 11</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 822 (1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-8" target="_self">G.S. 49-8</a></cite> contemplate initial findings and an order of support, subject to modification or increase from time to time, to be enforced by such prescribed supplemental orders as the exigencies of the case may require. State v. Dill, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 57</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 145 (1944).

       As to jurisdiction over defendant who was over 16 years of age
   
   during the time he was charged with willfully neglecting or refusing to support his illegitimate child, but was under 16 when conception of the child occurred, see State v. Bowser, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 330</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 282 (1949).

        <b>
         Many of the cases cited below were decided under former statutory provisions.
        </b>
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Constitutionality.
   
   - A judgment for an allowance for the mother of an illegitimate child is not a debt arising out of contract, to which the protection afforded by the inhibition of the constitutional provision against imprisonment for debt extends, but is rendered as a means of enforcing a legal obligation and duty imposed by the legislature under the police power of the State upon one who is responsible for bringing into existence a child that may become a burden to society. State v. Manuel, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. 144</cite> (1838); State v. Cannady, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. 539</cite> (1878); State v. Parsons, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 730</cite>, 20 S.E. 511 (1894); State v. Wynne, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 981</cite>, 21 S.E. 35 (1895); State v. Nelson, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 797</cite>, 25 S.E. 863 (1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       Imprisonment of the putative father for failure to obey an order of maintenance or give the bond is a matter of legislative discretion, and is not imprisonment for debt. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 172</cite> (1874); State v. Wynne, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 981</cite>, 21 S.E. 35 (1895); State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 726</cite>, 53 S.E. 142 (1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceedings in bastardy under the former law, C.S., G.S. 273, for an allowance to be made to the woman were civil and not criminal, for the enforcement of police regulations, and that section was held not to be contrary to the provisions of Art. IV,
   <span class="s2">
    §
   </span>
   27, of the Constitution of 1868, relating to jurisdiction of justices. Richardson v. Egerton, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 291</cite>, 119 S.E. 487 (1923).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Punishment for Failure to Support.
   
   - The only punishment authorized by law for the willful failure or neglect to support an illegitimate child is found in this section and is limited at most to six months in prison. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 188</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 756 (1970).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Six months is the maximum sentence permitted
   
   by this section. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Work on Roads.
   
   - Under former law, when there was no house of correction in the county, the court could only commit the putative father to jail until the performance of the order of support. He could not be put to work on roads. State v. Addington, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 683</cite>, 57 S.E. 398 (1907).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       For case in which sentence was held excessive,
   
   see State v. Nelson, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 797</cite>, 25 S.E. 863 (1896).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Suspension of Execution of Sentence.
   
   - Upon defendant's conviction of willful failure to support his illegitimate child, the trial court has plenary power to suspend execution of sentence on condition that defendant pay specified sums of money into court for support of his child. State v. Bowser, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 414</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 98 (1950). See also, State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 282</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 376 (1958).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Discharge.
   
   - After the defendant, who had served a 20-day sentence for failure to pay under former law, had been discharged, he could not be resentenced to the house of correction at a subsequent term. State v. Burton, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 655</cite>, 18 S.E. 657 (1893).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Support Payments Are Not a Fine.
   
   - The support payments ordered by a court are to be paid for the support of the defendant's minor children and are not in the nature of a fine. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 174 S.E.2d 8, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 188</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 756 (1970).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Application of Money Paid into Court.
   
   - This section does not contemplate that money paid into court to discharge past due obligations should be paid to a person to whom it was not due. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       When, without compensation, doctors and hospitals have performed immediately necessary services incident to the birth of a child and its subsequent welfare, public policy and simple justice require that money paid into court for them be disbursed directly to them; in no other way can their interests be protected. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Death of Child.
   
   - Under the former law, C.S. G.S. 273, the intention was to secure to the mother either her probable expenses or to reimburse her actual outlay, and the death of the child when born did not affect the right of the mother to "support"; among other things, she was entitled to payment for medical attention and medicine for herself and the burial expenses of the child, consequent upon the defendant's unlawful act. State v. Addington, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 683</cite>, 57 S.E. 398 (1907).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother as Creditor of Father.
   
   - The mother of an illegitimate child, to whom an allowance has been made in bastardy proceedings, is such a creditor of the father of her child as to permit her to oppose the insolvent's discharge by suggesting fraud in answer to his petition. State v. Parsons, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 730</cite>, 20 S.E. 511 (1894).

     <p>
      The putative father of any child born out of wedlock, whether such father resides in North Carolina or not, may apply by a verified written petition, filed in a special proceeding in the superior court of the county in which the putative father resides or in the superior court of the county in which the child resides, praying that such child be declared legitimate. The mother, if living, and the child shall be necessary parties to the proceeding, and the full names of the father, mother and the child shall be set out in the petition. A certified copy of a certificate of birth of the child shall be attached to the petition. If it appears to the court that the petitioner is the father of the child, the court may thereupon declare and pronounce the child legitimated; and the full names of the father, mother and the child shall be set out in the court order decreeing legitimation of the child. The clerk of the court shall record the order in the record of orders and decrees and it shall be cross-indexed under the name of the father as plaintiff or petitioner on the plaintiff's side of the cross-index, and under the name of the mother, and the child as defendants or respondents on the defendants' side of the cross-index.

       Requirement That Child's Surname Be Changed Is Invalid.
   
   - The valid purpose served by this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-13" target="_self">G.S. 49-13</a></cite> of establishing the filial relationship between illegitimate children and their fathers is not enhanced, advanced or served in any useful or justifiable way by the additional requirement that the child's surname be changed to that of the father; such a requirement denies the mother of an illegitimate child the equal protection of the laws, and because it requires arbitrary action on the part of an agency of the State, it denies such mothers a protected liberty interest without due process of law. Jones v. McDowell, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 281 S.E.2d 192 (1981).

   49-12.1 is whether a putative father is the biological father of a minor child such that the rights and responsibilities inherent in the relationship between father and child may be acknowledged.

       Section Read in Conjunction with Statutes Applicable to Special Proceedings.
   
   - This section, as a special proceeding, should provide procedural mechanisms for the full and fair resolution of cases. To ensure the parties' right to a trial by jury, this section can and should be read in conjunction with the procedural statutes that apply to all special proceeding. In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Legitimation Procedure Within Jurisdiction of Superior Court Clerk.
   
   - The legitimation procedure, which is identified in this section as a special proceeding in the superior court of the county in which the putative father resides, is within the jurisdictional purview of the clerk of superior court. In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The clerks of superior court have authority, pursuant to this section, to enter an order legitimating a minor child of a man who alleges that he is the child's natural father, where the child is presumed to be legitimate because he was born to his mother while she was lawfully married to another man, provided that the issue of paternity must be submitted to and decided by a jury after the child and the husband have been properly made parties to the proceeding. In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of Procedure for Legitimation.
   
   - By specifying the manner and time in which an illegitimate child may establish his paternity, this State has sought (1) to mitigate the hardships created by former law (which permitted illegitimate children to inherit only from the mother and from each other); (2) to equalize, insofar as practical, the inheritance rights of legitimate and illegitimate children; and (3) at the same time, to safeguard the just and orderly disposition of a decedent's property and the dependability of titles passing under intestate laws. Mitchell v. Freuler, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 206</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 762 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several ways to legitimate children
   
   in North Carolina: 1) verified petition filed with the superior court by the putative father, 2) subsequent marriage of the parents, or 3) civil action to establish paternity. Helms v. Young-Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 746, 411 S.E.2d 184 (1991), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 117</cite>, 414 S.E.2d 756, 506 U.S. 829, 113 S. Ct. 91, 121 L. Ed. 2d 53 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Phrase "born out of wedlock" should refer to the status of the parents of the child
   
   in relation to each other. In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A child born to a married woman, but begotten by one other than her husband,
   
   is a child "born out of wedlock." In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Legitimation on Prior Consent to Adoption.
   
   - A legitimation proceeding brought under this section by the putative father of a child born out of wedlock, wherein the child was declared legitimate, had no effect upon the prior written consent to adoption given by the unwed mother under G.S. 48-6. In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 560, 181 S.E.2d 760, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 394</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 244 (1971).

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute Inoperative After Death of Father.
   
   - Both the North Carolina legitimation and paternity statutes are inoperative after the death of the father. Tucker v. City of Clinton, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 776, 463 S.E.2d 806 (1995).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Standing to Bring Legitimation Action After Termination of Parental Rights.
   
   - Where father's parental rights had been terminated under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba11s7B-1112" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-1112</a></cite> in 1999, he lacked standing to bring an action under G. S. 49-10, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-11" target="_self">G.S. 49-11</a></cite> to legitimate the same child to whom his parental rights had been terminated. Gorsuch v. Dees, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 618 S.E.2d 747 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Petition to Be Filed by Father Only.
   
   - This statute unambiguously limits the person who may file a legitimation petition to the putative father of any child born out of wedlock; thus, the putative grandfather lacked standing to attempt legitimation. Tucker v. City of Clinton, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 776, 463 S.E.2d 806 (1995).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsequently Filed Affidavit Did Not Relate Back to Original Filing Date.
   
   - Where termination order, later held to be invalid for failure to use due diligence in ascertaining
   putative father's address, was filed with adoption petition in lieu of affidavit required by G.S. 48-13, a subsequently filed affidavit did not relate back to original filing date of petition so as to cut off rights of
   putative father who filed legitimation petition to this section before affidavit was filed. In re Adoption of Clark, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 61</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 791 (1990).

       "Best Interest of the Child" Inquiry Not Required.
   
   - North Carolina's General Assembly has not required a best interest of the child inquiry in the context of a legitimation proceeding. While the General Assembly has specifically required such an inquiry under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.2" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.2</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite>, its failure to mandate a best interest inquiry in connection with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-10" target="_self">G.S. 49-10</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-12.1" target="_self">G.S. 49-12.1</a></cite> is clear evidence of its intent that no such inquiry is required in this context.

       Married Woman's Husband Should Be Summoned.
   
   - As a potentially adverse party in a special proceeding under this section brought by natural father of child whose mother was married to another man at the time of his conception and birth, the married woman's husband should be construed as one of the respondents on whom summons must be served. In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985). See also <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-12.1" target="_self">G.S. 49-12.1</a></cite>.

       Summons Procedure Governed by G.S.

       Standard of Proof.
   
   - This section, just as <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite>, requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt to establish paternity in rebuttal of the presumption of legitimacy arising from the lawful marriage of child's mother to man other than its natural father. In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985). But see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-12.1ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 49-12.1(c)</a></cite>.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption of Legitimacy Where Child's Mother Is Married.
   
   - Because of the strong presumption of legitimacy involved where mother of child is married, the lawful husband of the mother has an obvious interest in a legitimation proceeding involving a child born to his wife while the two were married. The rebuttal of this presumption should be presented to and resolved by a jury to ensure that the parties' rights are adequately protected. In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Man Living with Mother for Five Years Preceding Child's Birth Was Putative Father.
   
   - Petitioner, who had lived openly and notoriously in an adulterous relationship with the mother of child (born in 1965) since 1960, continuing to maintain and care for the child born of that relationship, was the "putative father" of the child, rather than the mother's husband, who discontinued living with the mother in 1960, years before the child was born. In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Transfer to Civil Docket for Jury Determination of Paternity.
   
   - Resolution by a jury of the factual issue of paternity, when a presumption of legitimacy is involved, may be accomplished by transferring the case to the civil issue docket for trial at the next ensuing session of the superior court pursuant to G.S. 1-273 [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27As1-301.1" target="_blank">G.S. 1-301.1</a></cite> et seq.]. Therefore, it is not necessary to require that the putative father first file a paternity action under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> before proceeding under this section to have child legitimated. In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985).

       Relationship to Actions for Custody.
   
   - Father of a child born out of wedlock who sought custody of the child under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.1ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.1(a)</a></cite> was treated as a third party as he had not legitimated the child pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-10" target="_self">G.S. 49-10</a></cite>, 49-12, or 49-12.1 or had his paternity adjudicated under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite>.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Priority over Paternity Action.
   
   - When a putative father filed both an action for custody in the district court, which was converted into a paternity action, and a legitimation action in the superior court, the legitimation action took priority, as legitimation vested greater rights in the parent and child than an order adjudicating paternity; therefore, the court in which the custody action was filed was divested of jurisdiction. Smith v. Barbour, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 571 S.E.2d 872 (2002), cert. denied, - N.C.
   - , 599 S.E.2d 408 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       In a termination of parental rights proceeding,
   
   because a trial court improperly interpreted a stipulation regarding legitimacy under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-10" target="_self">G.S. 49-10</a></cite>, it erroneously found that the four factors in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a5" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(5)</a></cite> were satisfied; because there was insufficient evidence on the elements outside of the stipulation, a reversal was required. In re I.S., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 611 S.E.2d 467 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of a father's parental rights was upheld on appeal since the father failed to challenge any of the findings of fact made by the trial court, namely that prior to the date the motion to terminate his parental rights was filed, he never established paternity over the minor child at issue, never legitimated the child by statute or marriage, nor had he provided any financial support. In re A.R.H.B., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 211, 651 S.E.2d 247 (2007), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 235</cite>, 659 S.E.2d 433 (2008).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of Parental Rights.
   
   - No evidence supported terminating a father's parental rights for failure to legitimate the children because no evidence was adduced showing (1) the children were born out of wedlock or, (2) when the petition was filed, the father did not file a paternity affidavit or petition to legitimate the children, legitimate the children by marrying the children's mother, or establish paternity in court, and (3) a proffer that the father did not pay support or provide gifts or clothes since the children were in foster care did not suffice.

      The effect of legitimation under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-10" target="_self">G.S. 49-10</a></cite> shall be to impose upon the father and mother all of the lawful parental privileges and rights, as well as all of the obligations which parents owe to their lawful issue, and to the same extent as if said child had been born in wedlock, and to entitle such child by succession, inheritance or distribution, to take real and personal property by, through, and from his or her father and mother as if such child had been born in lawful wedlock.

       Purpose of Procedure for Legitimation.
   
   - By specifying the manner and time in which an illegitimate child may establish his paternity, this State has sought (1) to mitigate the hardships created by former law (which permitted illegitimate children to inherit only from the mother and from each other); (2) to equalize, insofar as practical, the inheritance rights of legitimate and illegitimate children; and (3) at the same time, to safeguard the just and orderly disposition of a decedent's property and the dependability of titles passing under intestate laws. Mitchell v. Freuler, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 206</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 762 (1979).

      <p>
       Legitimated Child May Inherit By, Through and From Parents.
   
   - A legitimated child shall have the same right to inherit by, through and from his father and mother as if such child had been born in lawful wedlock. Greenlee v. Quinn, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 601</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 409 (1961).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The plain intent and language of this section
   
   is that a legitimated child shall inherit his father's real estate and be entitled to the personal estate of his father in the same manner as if it had been born in lawful wedlock. Love v. Love, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 115</cite>, 101 S.E. 562 (1919).

       Transfer of Rights and Duties to Biological Father.
   
   - Husband of the mother of a child born during the parties' marriage is presumed to be the father of that child and, thus, enjoys all the parental rights and privileges, as well as obligations, to that child. A determination that a petitioner in a legitimation action, and not the husband, is the biological father of the child terminates the husband's rights to the child, conferring them onto petitioner pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-11" target="_self">G.S. 49-11</a></cite>; thus, unless the husband has previously been determined not to be the child's father, he is a necessary party to the proceeding pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C.

       Upon the evidence in the case, and the theory of the defense, the defendant could not invoke the doctrine of vested rights so as to contest the constitutionality of this section. Bowman v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 662</cite>, 110 S.E. 98 (1921).

       Purpose of Procedure for Legitimation.
   
   - By specifying the manner and time in which an illegitimate child may establish his paternity, this State has sought (1) to mitigate the hardships created by former law (which permitted illegitimate children to inherit only from the mother and from each other); (2) to equalize, insofar as practical, the inheritance rights of legitimate and illegitimate children; and (3) at the same time, to safeguard the just and orderly disposition of a decedent's property and the dependability of titles passing under intestate laws. Mitchell v. Freuler, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 206</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 762 (1979).

   - This section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-13" target="_self">G.S. 49-13</a></cite> regulate the family circle and define the rights and responsibilities of members of the circle, and must be construed in pari materia.

       Action Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> Prohibited When Child Is Legitimated.
   
   - If child is legitimated by virtue of this section, an action under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> cannot be maintained, as G.S. 49-14 establishes a means of support for illegitimate children.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Strict Construction.
   
   - This section is strictly construed as being in derogation of the common law. In re Estate of Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 334</cite>, 148 S.E. 456 (1929).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Retroactivity of Section.
   
   - This section, by its express terms, is retroactive as well as prospective in effect. Stewart v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 476</cite>, 142 S.E. 577 (1928); Greenlee v. Quinn, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 601</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 409 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section are retroactive as well as prospective in effect, and a child born out of wedlock whose mother married his reputed father prior to the enactment of the statute is the heir of his parents who die subsequent to its enactment. In re Estate of Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 334</cite>, 148 S.E. 456 (1929).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature has given a new or additional meaning to the word "legitimate"
   
   as used in this section. Although this meaning is not strictly within its ordinary definition, the courts will adopt the meaning impressed upon the word by legislative enactment. Carter v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 614</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 711 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Reputed Father".
   
   - The word "reputed" means considered, or generally supposed, or accepted by general or public opinion. Bowman v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 662</cite>, 110 S.E. 98 (1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of the word "reputed" rather than "putative" in this section was intended merely to dispense with the absolute proof of paternity, so that, if the child is "regarded," "deemed," "considered," or "held in thought" by the parents themselves as their child, either before or after marriage, it is legitimate. Carter v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 614</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 711 (1950); Chambers v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 361, 258 S.E.2d 822 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       DNA sampling results may be used
   
   to rebut the presumption that a child born to a married woman is her husband's child and to simultaneously offer evidence that a person was "born out of wedlock" within the meaning of this section. Batcheldor v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 423 S.E.2d 810 (1992), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 254</cite>, 426 S.E.2d 700 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Irregularity in divorce proceedings
   
   is not a ground for declaring children who would otherwise be legitimated by a subsequent marriage illegitimate. Reed v. Blair, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 745</cite>, 164 S.E. 118 (1932).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Rights and Duties as to Custody and Support.
   
   - In declaring in this section that "the child shall in all respects after such intermarriage be deemed and held to be legitimate," the General Assembly clearly intended that the child should be treated as a child born in lawful wedlock in determining the rights and duties of parent and child as to custody and support. In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 1</cite>, 56 S.E.2d 8 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the reputed father of a child marries the child's mother after its birth, such child is deemed legitimate, just as if it had been born in lawful wedlock, and such child is a minor child of the marriage within the purview of the statute relating to custody and support of children in divorce; thus, the father may be required to furnish support for such child upon motion made either before or after decree of divorce. Carter v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 614</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 711 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Child Has Same Right to Inherit As If Born in Lawful Wedlock.
   
   - A legitimated child shall have the same right to inherit by, through and from his father and mother as if such child had been born in lawful wedlock. Greenlee v. Quinn, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 601</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 409 (1961).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Including Right to Inherit from Collateral Relations.
   
   - The legislature intended to confer upon the legitimated child the same right to inherit from collateral relations as it would have had if it had been born in lawful wedlock. Greenlee v. Quinn, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 601</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 409 (1961).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       As to inheritance from collateral relations
   
   under former law, see In re Estate of Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 334</cite>, 148 S.E. 456 (1929).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Marriage on Child's Legitimacy under Former Law.
   
   - Prior to the passage of this section, where, by the laws of the domicile of the parents at the time of the birth of their illegitimate child and of their marriage, their marriage legitimated him, the legitimacy attached at the time of the marriage, he being a minor, and followed him wherever he goes. Fowler v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 169</cite>, 42 S.E. 563 (1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the passage of this section in 1917, marriage of the parents did not legitimate the previous offspring. Ashe v. Camp Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. 241</cite>, 70 S.E. 295 (1911).

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1a">
       The paternity of a child born out of wedlock may be established by civil action at any time prior to such child's eighteenth birthday. A copy of a certificate of birth of the child shall be attached to the complaint. The establishment of paternity shall not have the effect of legitimation. The social security numbers, if known, of the minor child's parents shall be placed in the record of the proceeding.
      </li>
      <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1b">
       Proof of paternity pursuant to this section shall be by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.
      </li>
      <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1c">
       No such action shall be commenced nor judgment entered after the death of the putative father, unless the action is commenced either:
       <ol>
        <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1c1">
         Prior to the death of the putative father;

         Within one year after the date of death of the putative father, if a proceeding for administration of the estate of the putative father has not been commenced within one year of his death; or
        </li>
        <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1c3">
         Within the period specified in G.S. 28A-19-3(a) for presentation of claims against an estate, if a proceeding for administration of the estate of the putative father has been commenced within one year of his death.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1d">
       If the action to establish paternity is brought more than three years after birth of a child or is brought after the death of the putative father, paternity shall not be established in a contested case without evidence from a blood or genetic marker test.
      </li>
      <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1e">
       Either party to an action to establish paternity may request that the case be tried at the first session of the court after the case is docketed, but the presiding judge, in his discretion, may first try any pending case in which the rights of the parties or the public demand it.
      </li>
      <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1f">
       When a determination of paternity is pending in a IV-D case, the court shall enter a temporary order for child support upon motion and showing of clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of paternity. For purposes of this subsection, the results of blood or genetic tests shall constitute clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of paternity if the tests show that the probability of the alleged parent's parentage is ninety-seven percent (97%) or higher. If paternity is not thereafter established, then the putative father shall be reimbursed the full amount of temporary support paid under the order.
      </li>
      <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1g">
       Invoices for services rendered for pregnancy, childbirth, and blood or genetic testing are admissible as evidence without requiring third party foundation testimony and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amounts incurred for the services or for testing on behalf of the child.
      </li>
      <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1h">
       Notwithstanding the time limitations of G.S. 1A-1, Rule 60 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, or any other provision of law, an order of paternity may be set aside by a trial court if each of the following applies:
       <ol>
        <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1h1">
         The paternity order was entered as the result of fraud, duress, mutual mistake, or excusable neglect.
        </li>
        <li id="t49a03s49-14ol1h2">
         Genetic tests establish the putative father is not the biological father of the child.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Any judgment under this subsection establishing a decedent to be the father of a child shall be entered nunc pro tunc to the day preceding the date of death of the father.
     </p>
     <p>
      The burden of proof in any motion to set aside an order of paternity shall be on the moving party. Upon proper motion alleging fraud, duress, mutual mistake, or excusable neglect, the court shall order the child's mother, the child whose parentage is at issue, and the putative father to submit to genetic paternity testing pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008.html#t08a07s8-50.1" target="_blank">G.S. 8-50.1(b1)</a></cite>. If the court determines, as a result of genetic testing, the putative father is not the biological father of the child and the order of paternity was entered as a result of fraud, duress, mutual mistake, or excusable neglect, the court may set aside the order of paternity. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect the presumption of legitimacy where a child is born to a mother and the putative father during the course of a marriage.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose.
   
   - The legislature, by enacting this section, intended to establish a means of support for illegitimate children. Wright v. Gann, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 45, 217 S.E.2d 761, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 513</cite>, 219 S.E.2d 348 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       By specifying the manner and time in which an illegitimate child may establish his paternity, this State has sought (1) to mitigate the hardships created by former law (which permitted illegitimate children to inherit only from the mother and from each other); (2) to equalize, insofar as practical, the inheritance rights of legitimate and illegitimate children; and (3) at the same time, to safeguard the just and orderly disposition of a decedent's property and the dependability of titles passing under intestate laws. Mitchell v. Freuler, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 206</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 762 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purposes of this Article are to enable an illegitimate child to receive support from its biological father and to prevent it from becoming a public charge. County of Lenoir ex rel. Cogdell v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 182, 264 S.E.2d 816 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of an action under this section is to establish the identity of the biological father of an illegitimate child so that the child's right to support may be enforced and the child will not become a public charge. Smith v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 328 S.E.2d 811 (1985), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 523</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 408 (1986); Smith v. Bumgarner, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 443 S.E.2d 744 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislative purpose underlying this section's paternity actions is to provide the basis or means of establishing the identity of the putative father in order to allow the courts to impose an obligation of support. Becton v. George, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 607, 369 S.E.2d 366 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute Inoperative After Death of Father.
   
   - Both the North Carolina legitimation and paternity statutes are inoperative after the death of the father. Tucker v. City of Clinton, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 776, 463 S.E.2d 806 (1995).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several ways to legitimate children
   
   in North Carolina: 1) verified petition filed with the superior court by the putative father, 2) subsequent marriage of the parents, or 3) civil action to establish paternity. Helms v. Young-Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 746, 411 S.E.2d 184 (1991), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 117</cite>, 414 S.E.2d 756, 506 U.S. 829, 113 S. Ct. 91, 121 L.

      <p>
       <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-2" target="_self">G.S. 49-2</a></cite> Compared.
   
   - The issue of paternity is the entire thrust of the civil action under this section, whereas the focus of the crime punishable by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-2" target="_self">G.S. 49-2</a></cite> is the willful failure to pay support for an illegitimate child, not paternity, because that section does not make the mere begetting of a child a crime. Stephens v. Worley, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 277 S.E.2d 81 (1981).

       Applicability of G.S.
   
   50-13.6. - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.6" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.6</a></cite> does not apply to civil actions to establish paternity under this section, but would authorize an award of reasonable attorney fees for custody and support actions involving an illegitimate child whose paternity had been determined. Smith v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 328 S.E.2d 811 (1985), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 523</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 408 (1986).

      <p>
       Effect of Acknowledgment of Paternity Under G.S.
   
   110-132. - There are significant differences between an acknowledgment of paternity under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.110.html#t110a09s110-132" target="_blank">G.S. 110-132</a></cite> in an agreement to provide child support and the procedures governing the legitimation of a child; where father had not taken any steps to legitimate the child, by statute or judicial determination, his execution of an acknowledgment of paternity under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.110.html#t110a09s110-132" target="_blank">G.S. 110-132</a></cite> did not erase the common law presumption in favor of mother's custody. Rosero v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 563 S.E.2d 248, cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 166</cite>, 568 S.E.2d 610 (2002).

       Action Under This Section Prohibited When Child Is Legitimated.
   
   - If child is legitimated by virtue of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-12" target="_self">G.S. 49-12</a></cite>, an action under this section cannot be maintained, as this section establishes a means of support for illegitimate children. Lewis v. Stitt, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 356 S.E.2d 398 (1987).

       This section is applicable to all illegitimate children,

       Enforcement of Child's Right to Support.
   
   - The illegitimate child has no statutory right to parental support through criminal proceedings; rather, such child's right to parental support is enforced by an action under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-15" target="_self">G.S. 49-15</a></cite>, which impose a support obligation on persons determined to be the parents of an illegitimate child. The function of a criminal prosecution of a parent who willfully fails to support his illegitimate child is not to compensate the illegitimate child, but to promote society's interest in preventing the parents of children from willfully leaving those children without parental support. State v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 290 S.E.2d 730, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 559</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 225 (1982).

       Only Designated Persons Have Standing.
   
   - If the North Carolina Legislature wanted others to have the capacity to be parties in a <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> paternity it could have also designated those others, but it did not when it consciously changed the existing common law.

      <p>
       Only Parent Who Has Custody of Child May Bring Action for Support.
   
   - Although plaintiff alleged that he was the father of the child, he did not allege that he had custody, therefore under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.4" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.4</a></cite>, only a parent who has custody of a minor child may bring an action for its support.

       Siblings Do Not Have Standing.
   
   - Trial court properly disallowed intervention by child's two siblings in mother's paternity action against putative father's estate; in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-16" target="_self">G.S. 49-16</a></cite>, the designation of who had standing to participate in a <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> paternity proceeding was intended to be construed as written.

       A paternity suit under this section is a civil action,

       Actions to enforce the child's right to support under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-15" target="_self">G.S. 49-15</a></cite> are civil actions. State v.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A suit brought for the sole purpose of establishing paternity pursuant to this section is not a criminal prosecution
   
   and cannot be considered criminal in nature simply because plaintiff must meet a higher burden of proof and establish such paternity beyond a reasonable doubt. Bell v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 715</cite>, 264 S.E.2d 101 (1980).

       Confers No Per Se Right to Counsel.
   
   - The mere begetting of a child, standing alone, is not a crime in this State. It is true that a related threat of actual imprisonment, based partially upon a prior determination of paternity, may arise in subsequent criminal or civil enforcement proceedings if such becomes necessary to secure a defendant-father's support obligation to his child. However, it is plain that this uncertain "web of possibilities" concerning future sanctions or ramifications does not constitute an immediate threat of imprisonment in the initial civil paternity action itself, especially since the defendant may, in fact, prevail on the critical issue of fatherhood. Thus, there is no per se constitutional right to appointed counsel for an indigent defendant in a civil paternity suit under this section, by whomever instituted, because the necessary menace to personal liberty is clearly absent at that legal stage. Wake County ex rel. Carrington v. Townes, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 333</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 95 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1113, 103 S. Ct. 745, 74 L. Ed. 2d 965 (1983).

      <p>
       Since Only One Issue Is Presented.
   
   - Representation by legal counsel is not invariably an essential component of fairness in all child support enforcement proceedings. There is but one factual issue in a paternity action, i.e., whether the defendant is the father of the child, and practically speaking, this is not an especially complex matter. The crux of most cases is credibility: simply deciding whom to believe. Wake County ex rel. Carrington v. Townes, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 333</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 95 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1113, 103 S. Ct. 745, 74 L. Ed. 2d 965 (1983).

       Absent Counsel, Indigent May Not Later Be Incarcerated to Enforce Support Order.
   
   - An indigent person cannot be sent to jail in any later proceeding to enforce a child support order, unless he had the benefit of legal assistance and advocacy at the proceeding in which paternity was determined. Wake County ex rel. Carrington v. Townes, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 333</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 95 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1113, 103 S. Ct. 745, 74 L. Ed. 2d 965 (1983).

       Failure to Join Child Does Not Require Dismissal.
   
   - In a civil action to establish paternity of an alleged illegitimate child the failure to properly join that child does not justify dismissal of the action. Smith v. Bumgarner, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 443 S.E.2d 744 (1994).
      </p>

       Trial Judge to Determine Necessity for Appointed Counsel.
   
   - The trial judge shall determine, in the first instance, what true fairness requires, in light of all of the circumstances, when an indigent makes a motion for the appointment of counsel in a civil paternity suit. The trial court should proceed with an evaluation of the vital interests at stake on both sides and a determination of the degree of actual complexity involved in the given case and the corresponding nature of defendant's peculiar problems, if any, in presenting his own defense without appointed legal assistance. The judge must then weigh the foregoing factors against the overall and strong presumption that the defendant is not entitled to the appointment of counsel in a proceeding which does not present an immediate threat to personal liberty. Wake County ex rel. Carrington v. Townes, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 333</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 95 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1113, 103 S. Ct. 745, 74 L. Ed. 2d 965 (1983).

       Effect of Criminal Proceedings Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-2" target="_self">G.S. 49-2</a></cite> upon Proceedings under This Section.
   
   - Since the parties to a previous criminal proceeding under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-2" target="_self">G.S. 49-2</a></cite> and civil proceedings under this section were not the same, and the State and the present plaintiff were not in privity, the defendant was not estopped in the civil action to deny paternity. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment of acquittal in a criminal prosecution under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a01s49-2" target="_self">G.S. 49-2</a></cite> for willful failure to support two illegitimate children was not res judicata in a county's civil action under this section to establish defendant's paternity of the two children, where the criminal judgment merely stated that defendant was found not guilty, and did not disclose whether an acquittal was entered because the judge found that defendant was not the father of the children or because he did not believe that defendant had willfully failed to provide for their reasonable support, as there was thus no showing on the record that the issue of paternity had been previously adjudicated in defendant's favor. Stephens v. Worley, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 277 S.E.2d 81 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a criminal action has been dismissed on grounds that the statute of limitations has run, and there is an identity of interest between the plaintiffs in the criminal and civil actions so that the parties are in privity, plaintiffs in the civil action are estopped by the judgment in the criminal action, even where the law has changed since the criminal action so as to allow proof of paternity by blood test. Settle ex rel. Sullivan v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 298 S.E.2d 62 (1982), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 616</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 288 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       General verdict of not guilty, upon charges of willful neglect and refusal to provide adequate support of an illegitimate child, did not operate as res judicata on the issue of paternity in subsequent action to establish paternity and require support of an illegitimate child.

      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Prior Determination in Action by County to Recover Support from Father.
   
   - Child's interests in having his paternity determined were not so identified with a county's interest in a prior action to recover from the father amounts paid by the county for child support that they were determinable in that action. The interest of the county, the real party in interest in the prior suit, was solely economic, as it was only interested in requiring the responsible parent to support the child and to recoup the amounts that it had paid for such support. The child, on the other hand, had more at stake in the later suit seeking support from his father, as the paternity adjudication would dramatically affect his personal interests. Settle ex rel. Sullivan v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 616</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 288 (1983).
   <br />

      <p>
       No Certified Copies of Birth Certificates Attached to Petition.
   
   - In action under Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, where the record disclosed that no certified copies of the birth certificates of the alleged children-obligees were attached to plaintiffs' petition, court was without subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate defendant's paternity. Reynolds v. Motley, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 385 S.E.2d 548 (1989), (decided under prior law).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       In actions under this section, the jury decides only the factual issue of paternity,
   
   and the court decides what payments should be awarded for the support of the child. Searcy v. Justice, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 202 S.E.2d 314 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim of Being Tricked into Fathering Child Not Appropriate as Defense.
   
   - Argument of defendant in paternity proceeding in which he counterclaimed against plaintiff for fraud that he was tricked into fathering a child and should not bear the financial responsibility for it was not appropriate in a civil action to establish paternity, either as a defense or a counterclaim. Smith v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 328 S.E.2d 811 (1985), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 523</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 408 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Clear, Cogent &amp; Convincing Standard.
   
   - The plaintiff's testimony at trial that she had sexual contact with no man other than defendant either in 1990 or 1991, expert testimony regarding the likelihood of conception given the number of sexual encounters between the two, and exhibits indicating that the child bears a strong resemblance to the defendant were sufficient to support the trial court's conclusion that defendant was the child's biological parent. Brown v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 526 S.E.2d 686 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt.
   
   - In a paternity action under this section, plaintiff must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant is the father of the child whose paternity is in issue. Thus, in a paternity case, in order to affirm a JNOV, the court must conclude as a matter of law that the jury could have had no reasonable doubt that defendant was the biological father of plaintiff 's son. Smith v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 413</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 408 (1986).

      <p>
       Testimony by Expert Concerning Paternity.
   
   - Although it may be proper for a qualified physician to testify concerning the result of a defendant's blood test and concerning the use and application of the paternity index, it is not proper to allow the expert to state his opinion concerning paternity, as such an opinion is of no assistance to the trier of fact. The jury is equally capable of weighing the genetic factors along with the nongenetic circumstances to determine the ultimate probability of paternity. Lombroia v. Peek, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 745, 421 S.E.2d 784 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Assertion by Court as to Paternity of Child Held Prejudicial Error.
   
   - In flatly asserting that the person who had had intercourse with plaintiff 10 lunar months before the birth of her child would be the father of her child, the court ignored the possibility of a premature birth or an unusually long pregnancy, and thus committed prejudicial error. Searcy v. Justice, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 202 S.E.2d 314 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Visitation Rights of Father.
   
   - The principle that the father of an illegitimate child is not entitled to visitation privileges absent consent of the mother has been abrogated by statutes as well as case law. Conley v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 122, 210 S.E.2d 88 (1974) (decided under prior law).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Transfer to Civil Docket for Jury Determination of Paternity.
   
   - Resolution by a jury of the factual issue of paternity, when a presumption of legitimacy is involved, may be accomplished by transferring the case to the civil issue docket for trial at the next ensuing session of the superior court pursuant to G.S. 1-273 [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27As1-301.1" target="_blank">G.S. 1-301.1</a></cite> et seq.]. Therefore, it is not necessary to require that the putative father first file a paternity action under this section before proceeding under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a02s49-10" target="_self">G.S. 49-10</a></cite> to have child legitimated.

       Priority of Legitimation Action over Paternity Action.
   
   - When a putative father filed both an action for custody in the district court, which was converted into a paternity action, and a legitimation action in the superior court, the legitimation action took priority, as legitimation vested greater rights in the parent and child than an order adjudicating paternity; therefore, the court in which the custody action was filed was divested of jurisdiction. Smith v. Barbour, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 571 S.E.2d 872 (2002), cert. denied, - N.C.

       - While paternity had to be established for an illegitimate child to inherit from a father who died intestate, North Carolina had no statute requiring that paternity be established for an illegitimate child to benefit from a life insurance policy, and the policy at issue in defendant claimant's case did not exclude illegitimate children unless paternity had been judicially established.

       § 49-15. Custody and support of children born out of wedlock when paternity established.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon and after the establishment of paternity pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> of a child born out of wedlock, the rights, duties, and obligations of the mother and the father so established, with regard to support and custody of the child, shall be the same, and may be determined and enforced in the same manner, as if the child were the legitimate child of the father and mother. When paternity has been established, the father becomes responsible for medical expenses incident to the pregnancy and the birth of the child.

       Effect of Acknowledgment of Paternity Under G.S.
   
   110-132. - There are significant differences between an acknowledgment of paternity under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.110.html#t110a09s110-132" target="_blank">G.S. 110-132</a></cite> in an agreement to provide child support and the procedures governing the legitimation of a child; where father had not taken any steps to legitimate the child, by statute or judicial determination, his execution of an acknowledgment of paternity under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.110.html#t110a09s110-132" target="_blank">G.S. 110-132</a></cite> did not erase the common law presumption in favor of mother's custody. Rosero v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 563 S.E.2d 248, cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 166</cite>, 568 S.E.2d 610 (2002).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Priority of Legitimation Action over Paternity Action.
   
   - When a putative father filed both an action for custody in the district court, which was converted into a paternity action, and a legitimation action in the superior court, the legitimation action took priority, as legitimation vested greater rights in the parent and child than an order adjudicating paternity; therefore, the court in which the custody action was filed was divested of jurisdiction. Smith v. Barbour, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 571 S.E.2d 872 (2002), cert. denied, - N.C.
   - , 599 S.E.2d 408 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       How Rights Determined and Enforced.
   
   - This section contemplates that parents' rights may be determined and enforced in an action brought pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite>, and does not contemplate the bringing of a separate action for that purpose pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.1" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.1</a></cite> et seq., which relates to the custody and support of legitimate children. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Child's Welfare Is Primary Consideration.
   
   - Once paternity is established, the proper custody and amount of support are determined in the same manner as for a legitimate child. In making this determination, the court has considerable discretion, but the welfare of the child is the primary consideration. To determine the rights of an illegitimate child any differently would violate the illegitimate child's constitutional right to equal protection of the law. Smith v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 328 S.E.2d 811 (1985), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 523</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 408 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The illegitimate child has no statutory right to parental support through criminal proceedings;
   
   rather, such child's right to parental support is enforced by an action under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite>, which impose a support obligation on persons determined to be the parents of an illegitimate child. The function of a criminal prosecution of a parent who willfully fails to support his illegitimate child is not to compensate the illegitimate child, but to promote society's interest in preventing the parents of children from willfully leaving those children without parental support. State v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 290 S.E.2d 730, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 559</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 225 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Actions to enforce the child's right to support under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> are civil actions.
   
   State v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 290 S.E.2d 730, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 559</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 225 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Retroactive Child Support Awards Authorized.
   
   - Trial court was not precluded as a matter of law from awarding retroactive child support under this section. Napowsa v. Langston, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 14, 381 S.E.2d 882, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 709</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 460 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An action to enforce liability under this section is barred after three years under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa05s1-52" target="_blank">G.S. 1-52(2)</a></cite>.
   
   Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute of Limitation Applies to Each Expenditure.
   
   - Each time a mother makes an expenditure reasonably incurred for the support of a child, such expenditure creates in her a new right to reimbursement, so that the statute of limitation applicable to proceedings hereunder, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa05s1-52" target="_blank">G.S. 1-52(2)</a></cite>, begins to run against each expenditure on the date when the expenditure was made. Tidwell v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 98</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 816 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctrine of laches is not applicable to an action for retroactive child support
   
   since the public policy concerns about stale claims are already adequately served by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa05s1-52" target="_blank">G.S. 1-52(2)</a></cite>. Napowsa v. Langston, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 14, 381 S.E.2d 882, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 709</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 460 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Extent of Recovery for Past Expenditures.
   
   - Assuming adequate proof of the expenditures under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.4ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.4(c)</a></cite>, the plaintiff-mother could recover reimbursement for her past support expenditures (1) to the extent she paid the father's share of such expenditures, and (2) to the extent the expenditures occurred three years or less before August 8, 1986, the date she filed her claim for child support. Napowsa v. Langston, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 14, 381 S.E.2d 882, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 709</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 460 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Attach Certified Copies of Birth Certificates to Petition.
   
   - In action under Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, where the record disclosed that no certified copies of the birth certificates of the alleged children-obligees were attached to plaintiff's petition, court was without subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate defendants' paternity. Reynolds v. Motley, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 385 S.E.2d 548 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Court Decides Payments to Be Awarded.
   
   - In actions under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite>, the jury decides only the factual issue of paternity, and the court decides what payments should be awarded for the support of the child. Searcy v. Justice, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 202 S.E.2d 314 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Criminal Proceedings upon Proceedings to Establish Paternity.
   
   - General verdict of not guilty, upon charges of willful neglect and refusal to provide adequate support of an illegitimate child, did not operate as res judicata on the issue of paternity in subsequent action to establish paternity and require support of an illegitimate child. Sampson County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. McPherson v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 372 S.E.2d 340 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Visitation Rights of Father.
   
   - The principle that the father of an illegitimate child is not entitled to visitation privileges absent consent of the mother has been abrogated by statutes as well as case law. Conley v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 122, 210 S.E.2d 88 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The district court was authorized to grant visitation privileges
   
   to father and to punish the mother for refusing to allow father to visit his illegitimate child. Conley v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 122, 210 S.E.2d 88 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Reimbursement by State upon Receipt of Test Results.
   
   - Conclusion that defendant was not child's father and that the State was obligated to reimburse defendant for the monies it illegally garnished from his pay arose as a matter of law from paternity test results, which plaintiff and the court accepted as binding when order was entered, and stating those conclusions and ending the case properly in compliance with the law was the court's duty.

       Siblings Do Not Have Standing.
   
   - Trial court properly disallowed intervention by child's two siblings in mother's paternity action against putative father's estate; in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-16" target="_self">G.S. 49-16</a></cite>, the designation of who had standing to participate in a <cite class="octn"><a href="#t49a03s49-14" target="_self">G.S. 49-14</a></cite> paternity proceeding was intended to be construed as written. Stockton v. Estate of Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 899, 600 S.E.2d 13 (2004).

       Visitation Rights of Father.
   
   - The principle that the father of an illegitimate child is not entitled to visitation privileges absent consent of the mother has been abrogated by statutes as well as case law. Conley v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 122, 210 S.E.2d 88 (1974).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Constitutionality.
   
   - This section satisfies the first prong of the test set out in Dillon v. Numismatic Funding Corp., <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 674</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 629 (1977) by creating special jurisdiction under very limited circumstances; on its face, this statute is constitutionally sound and although the language in this section which refers to "minimum contacts" is misleading and confusing in the context of the Dillon requirements, the intent of the statute is not to abrogate the second prong of the Dillon test; rather, the statute simply creates special jurisdiction in certain situations. Cochran v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 167, 381 S.E.2d 853 (1989).

       Due Process Requirements Satisfied.
   
   - In paternity suit, where the trial court adequately inquired into the defendant's contacts with this State and so set those findings out in its order without objection of the defendant, the hearing which was held on defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction comported with all due process requirements. Cochran v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 167, 381 S.E.2d 853 (1989).
