                        The common thread running throughout the Juvenile Code (G.S. 7A-516, et seq. [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-100</a></cite> et seq.]) is that the court must consider the child's best
                        interests in making all placements whether at the dispositional hearing or the review hearing. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 303 S.E.2d 636 (1983), modified, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>,
                        319 S.E.2d 567 (1984).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Purpose of Juvenile Code. - None of the purposes of the Juvenile Code were met by subjecting a child's family to Department of Social Services supervision because of an adult relative's abuse of the child in his home during a sleepover because an adjudication
                        of abuse and neglect neither promoted the child's best interest nor protected her mother's fundamental right to parent her child; the child's mother and stepfather took appropriate steps to ensure the child's safety. In re R.R.N.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 167</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 656 (2015).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Legislative Intent. - When, in a dependency proceeding, a trial court's order transferring a child's custody from a department of social services to foster parents was entered eight months late, this resulted in protracted custody proceedings that left
                        the legal relationship between parent and child unresolved and left the child in legal limbo, thwarting the legislature's wish that children be placed in safe, permanent homes within a reasonable amount of time, as stated in
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-100(5)</a></cite>. In re L.L., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 689, 616 S.E.2d 392 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In dependency proceedings, to hold that the failure of a department of social services to list the address of an allegedly dependent child in a petition under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-402" target="_self">G.S. 7B-402</a></cite>,
                        or that the department's failure to file an affidavit required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html#t50Aa02s50A-209ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 50A-209(a)</a></cite> could prevent a trial court from acquiring
                        subject matter jurisdiction over the juvenile action, would be to elevate form over substance; such a holding would additionally impose jurisdictional limitations that the general assembly clearly never intended in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-100(3)</a></cite>                        when it sought to balance the interests of children with the rights of parents in juvenile actions. In re A.R.G., <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 392</cite>, 646 S.E.2d 349 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contrary to the mother's assertion, leaving her sons in their current foster placements with periodic visitation by her was not working as a plan; this arrangement was not only contrary to the permanent plan established by the trial court, it also served
                        to deny the children the prospect of a safe, permanent home within a reasonable amount of time as contemplated by the Juvenile Code. Termination of the mother's parental rights was affirmed. In re J.S.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 811</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 66 (2020).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Best Interest of the Child is Paramount. - The common thread running throughout the Juvenile Code, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-100</a></cite> et seq., is that the court's primary concern must
                        be the child's best interest; a child's interest in being protected from abuse and neglect is paramount to his parents' constitutional interest in the custody of their child. In re Pittman, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite>                        756, 561 S.E.2d 560 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 982, 123 S. Ct. 1799, 155 L. Ed. 2d 673 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holding that <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite> did not deprive a trial court of jurisdiction to grant a motion for termination of parental rights that was filed during the pendency
                        of an appeal from the trial court's dispositional order was consistent with the purposes of the Juvenile Code because the holding minimized procedural delay unnecessary to protect parental rights that interfered with addressing
                        a child's needs. In re M.I.W., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 374</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 469 (2012).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's conclusion that termination of a mother's parental rights was in the child's best interests did not constitute an abuse of discretion because it properly considered the statutory factors; the trial court found that the conduct of the mother
                        and father demonstrated that they would not promote the child's health, physical, and mental well-being and that the child was no closer to returning home than she was on the day she entered into the care of the department of social
                        services. In re N.G., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 891</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 16 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Court properly terminated a father's parental rights because the father's choices and actions resulted in a lengthy delay in his projected release date from incarceration and significantly limited his access to classes, programs, services, and employment
                        which directly related to his case plan; there was no error in the trial court's findings of fact regarding the father's failures in accomplishing his case plan, most of which resulted from circumstances for which he was responsible.
                        In re G.B., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 16, 2021).
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        While one of the essential aims of the Juvenile Code is to reunite a parent with a child after the child is taken from the parent's custody, reunification may not always be a viable option. A trial court did not fail to consider the purpose and legislative
                        intent of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-100(4)</a></cite> when it terminated a mother's parental rights after finding clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that supported
                        neglect as a ground for termination. In re Dhermy, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 588 S.E.2d 555 (2003).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Goal of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-100(5)</a></cite> is to place children in safe, permanent houses within a reasonable time, and allowing parents to delay termination proceedings by appealing
                        custody review orders would have thwarted <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-100(5)</a></cite>; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite> did not deprive
                        the trial court of jurisdiction to terminate the mother's parental rights during the pendency of the custody review order appeal as <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite> applied only
                        to dependency proceedings, not to termination proceedings. In re R.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 539</cite>, 614 S.E.2d 489 (2005).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The purpose of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7As0Va23s7A-277" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-277</a></cite> was to give to delinquent children the control and environment which might lead to their reformation
                        and enable them to become law abiding and useful citizens, a support and not a hindrance to the State. In re Whichard, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 174 S.E.2d 281 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 940, 91 S. Ct. 2258,

                        Juvenile Hearing. - Former Subchapter XI of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7A</a></cite>, which contained the former North Carolina Juvenile Code, did not classify a juvenile hearing
                        as civil or criminal. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 161</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 405, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 956, 112 S. Ct. 414, 116 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Constitutional Rights at Juvenile Hearing. - There are certain constitutional rights which a juvenile has at a juvenile hearing which are not required in civil trials, such as the right to counsel if there is a possibility of commitment and the privilege
                        against self incrimination. This would suggest a juvenile hearing is not a civil case. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 161</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 405, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 956, 112 S. Ct. 414,

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in quashing s mother's subpoena for her child's testimony because its decision to quash the subpoena was based on a reasonable weighing of the relevance of the child's testimony and the detrimental effect that
                        testifying would have on the child; the trial court's evidentiary rulings assured fairness and equality and provided the mother with a meaningful opportunity to participate in the termination proceeding. In re A.H.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 546, 794 S.E.2d 866 (2016), review denied, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 294 (2017).

                    <p>
                        The court must consider the welfare of the delinquent child as well as the best interest of the State. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 251 S.E.2d 643 (1979).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        State's Interest in Juvenile Proceeding. - The fact that the proceeding is not an ordinary criminal prosecution, but is a juvenile proceeding, does not lessen, but should actually increase, the burden upon the State to see that the child's rights are
                        protected. In re Meyers, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 214 S.E.2d 268 (1975).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Limits to Agency Interference With Parent-Child Relationship. - Department of Social Services has an important role in protecting children; however, because parents have a fundamental right to parent their children, the courts must acknowledge the limits
                        within which governmental agencies may interfere with or intervene in the parent-child relationship. In re R.R.N., <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 167</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 656 (2015).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The county was not entitled to appeal an order to pay for the mental health evaluation of a juvenile although it had to be given notice and the opportunity to be heard at the juvenile hearing. In re Voight, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite>                        542, 530 S.E.2d 76 (2000).

                        The district court's authority in juvenile dispositions is limited to utilization of currently existing programs or those for which the funding and machinery for implementation is in place. In re Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite>                        167, 352 S.E.2d 449 (1987).

                    <p>
                        The former North Carolina Juvenile Code (former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa41s7A-516" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-516</a></cite> et seq.) did not grant the district courts the authority to order
                        the State, through the Division of Youth Services, to develop and implement specific treatment programs and facilities for juveniles. In re Swindell, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 473</cite>, 390 S.E.2d 134 (1990).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Court Order May Not Exceed Court's Authority. - When a student has been lawfully suspended or expelled pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115C.html#t115CsVIa27s115C-391" target="_blank">G.S. 115C-391</a></cite>                        and the school has not provided a suitable alternative educational forum, court-ordered public school attendance is not a dispositional alternative available to the juvenile court judge, absent a voluntary reconsideration of or
                        restructuring of the suspension by the school board to allow the student's restoration to an educational program within its system. In re Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 167, 352 S.E.2d 449 (1987).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Delinquency Proceedings May Result in Commitment. - Juvenile proceedings to determine delinquency, though not the same as criminal prosecutions of an adult, may nevertheless result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile's freedom is curtailed.
                        In re Meyers, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 214 S.E.2d 268 (1975).

                    <p>
                        Dismissal of Petitions Against Juveniles Treated Unequally. - The trial court erred in not dismissing petitions against six juveniles who received unequal treatment relative to other juveniles who were alleged to have committed the same or similar offenses
                        by design, in that each respondent was prosecuted because he or she, or his or her parents, was unwilling or unable to pay $1,000 compensation to the victim, while the other juveniles, who were similarly situated, were not prosecuted
                        because they, or their parents, were able or willing to pay $1,000 thereto. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 352 S.E.2d 889 (1987).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Interlocutory Order Not Appealable. - Because an order was best characterized as a temporary child custody order under G.S. ch. 50 rather than as a disposition order under G.S. ch. 7B, and was set for review in approximately four months, it was an interlocutory
                        order that did not affect any substantial right and was not appealable. In re N.T.S., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 731, 707 S.E.2d 651 (2011), review denied <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 203</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Lack of Jurisdiction Found. - Because a district court never exercised jurisdiction over defendant for the charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, the superior court that convicted him never obtained jurisdiction via transfer of the charge; because
                        the trial court lacked jurisdiction over defendant for the conspiracy charge, his conviction was vacated. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 600 S.E.2d 16 (2004).

                        "Caretaker" Limited. - In concluding that a stepfather's cousin was a child's caretaker, the trial court stretched <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(3)</a></cite> beyond its intended scope,
                        as the stepfather's cousin was simply a relative who sexually assaulted the child while the child was under the cousin's temporary supervision. The trial court erred in applying the Juvenile Code on these facts and in adjudicating
                        the child abused and neglected. In re R.R.N., <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 757 S.E.2d 503 (2014), review denied <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 524</cite>, 762 S.E.2d 213, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 622 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Court of appeals properly determined that the trial court erred in adjudicating a child abused and neglected because an adult relative was not the child's "caretaker" when he sexually abused her at his home during a sleepover because he was not entrusted
                        with her care; the child's mother and stepfather responded appropriately, and thus, the abuse of the child by the adult relative did not warrant the State's intrusion into the family unit. In re R.R.N.,

                        Stepfather had no standing to appeal an adjudication and disposition order because (1) the stepfather was not the child's "custodian," as the stepfather was not awarded the child's custody, so the stepfather was the child's "caretaker," which included
                        a stepparent, and (2) <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1002" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1002(4)</a></cite>, letting a "parent" appeal an order of adjudication and disposition, did not let a stepparent
                        appeal without showing the stepparent became the child's parent through adoption or was otherwise qualified. In re M.S., <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 785 S.E.2d 590 (2016).

                        "Community-Based Program". - Although the term "community-based program" is a term of art, its usage by the General Assembly reflects its concern that responses to the problems of the juveniles coming before the courts be fashioned in a flexible manner
                        so as to address the best interests of the child in ways other than probation and commitment to training schools (now youth development centers). In re Brownlee, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 532</cite>,

                        The term community ought to be interpreted in a broad manner, connoting an interrelationship among persons who live in the same general area, but who also share the same laws, rights, and interests. In re Brownlee, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 532</cite>,

                        "Dependent". - Trial court erred in adjudicating a mother's three-month-old son as dependent, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(9)</a></cite>, as the trial court's finding of fact
                        that the mother was not willing to investigate the needs of her son in a safe environment, after the infant suffered a severe head trauma while in the father's sole care, was not supported by clear and convincing evidence; as the
                        mother did not neglect her son, nor was he deemed abused, he was not dependent because he had a parent capable of providing care and supervision. In re J.A.G., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 617 S.E.2d 325 (2005).

                        Children were dependent where the parents were neither able to care for them nor did they suggest appropriate alternate replacements; the father's proposed replacement was insufficient because there was no evidence that his aunt was willing or able to
                        care for the children. In re D.J.D., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 615 S.E.2d 26 (2005).

                        Trial court's findings supported its conclusion that the children were dependent under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(9)</a></cite> because it found that the mother could not care for her
                        children without constant assistance, and that such assistance was not available to her. In re J.J., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 637 S.E.2d 258 (2006), aff'd, cert. dismissed, in part, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 172</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in the record supported the findings that the minor child was dependent as defined by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101</a></cite>, the mother failed to
                        show the ability to properly parent the minor child and attend to his special needs, and the mother had not seen the minor child since January 2007 and had not given gifts or support or shown any love or affection for the child
                        since she last saw him. The findings in turn supported the trial court's conclusions that the minor child was dependent and abandoned, both of which are statutory grounds for termination. In re J.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite>                        182, 681 S.E.2d 485 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Mother's children were properly adjudicated dependent because (1) the children's legal custodian died, and (2) the evidence supported a finding that no other appropriate relatives were available to provide care for the children. In re T.H., - N.C. App.

                    <p>
                        Evidence supported termination of the father's parental rights; the child had been placed in the custody of Youth and Family Services (YFS) as a result of being adjudicated dependent, and the conditions which led to the child being placed in YFS custody
                        were not necessarily tied to the fault of either parent, and instead, those conditions were based entirely on circumstances surrounding the child at the time he was adjudicated dependent, and the father made almost no effort to
                        either establish himself as a parent who could provide for the child, nor did he arrange alternative child care arrangements. In re A.W, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 765 S.E.2d 111 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred by concluding that a child was dependent because its order did not include findings that addressed either prong of dependency; there were no findings that the parents' behaviors rendered them wholly unable to parent the child; there
                        were no findings that the parents lacked an alternative child care arrangement. In re H.L., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 807 S.E.2d 685 (2017).

                        "Dependent Juvenile" - Trial court's finding of fact that the child's mother had not appropriately cared for him was not supported by clear and convincing evidence; similarly, the finding of fact that the mother was not willing to investigate the needs
                        of the child in a safe environment was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. Further, the child was not neglected as to his mother; therefore, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(9)</a></cite>,
                        the child was not dependent as to his mother because she was capable of providing care for and supervision of the child. In re J.A.G., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (June 7, 2005).

                        Trial court properly concluded that the children were dependent juveniles where the mother suffered from significant psychological conditions, the existence of which she did not dispute on appeal, and these conditions impaired her ability to parent the
                        children; one doctor noted that the mother had suicidal ideation and tendencies, that she was in a chronic state of stimulus overload, that she suffers from Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Personality Disorder, Major
                        Depressive Disorder, and Dependent Personality Disorder and that these serious psychological problems impaired the mother's ability to parent. In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 497,

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err by adjudicating the mother's two children as dependent juveniles because the grandmother, as their legal custodian, was deceased, the mother did not present herself as a potential caregiver, and there were no appropriate family
                        members immediately available to care for them long term. In re T.H., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 753 S.E.2d 207 (2014).

                        Trial court's findings that the child was forced to sleep outside, bound to a tree, required to participate in a self-baptism, ordered to pray while the boyfriend brandished a firearm, struck with a belt all over his body, and repeatedly told that he
                        was possessed by demons demonstrated that he was abused. In re F.C.D., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 780 S.E.2d 214 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Child's dependency adjudication was erroneous because (1) the parties agreed such a decision would be based on the court's conversations with the child in chambers, and (2) nothing showed the child provided the court with any information about the child's
                        father's ability to care for the child or was competent to do so. In re T.N.G., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 781 S.E.2d 93 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Child was not a dependent juvenile as required to terminate parental rights because she was not "in need of assistance or placement" at the time that the mother's petition to terminate a father's parental rights was filed since was in the legal and physical
                        custody of her mother. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 56 (2020).

                        "Neglect." - Because the trial court was acting under a misapprehension of the law, as it used the definition of "serious neglect" pertaining to the responsible individuals' list, as opposed to the definition of "neglect" pertaining to an adjudication
                        of a juvenile as neglected, the trial court's adjudication of "serious neglect" was reversed, and the case was remanded for the trial court's consideration of neglect within the proper statutory framework. In re J.M. &amp; J.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 804 S.E.2d 830 (2017), appeal dismissed, 808 S.E.2d 442, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 9 (N.C. 2018).

                    <p>
                        Findings were insufficient to support a determination that the father had neglected his child because the father's incarceration alone could not serve as clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of neglect, the order did not establish that the father failed
                        to comply with the domestic violence-related portions of his case plan or engaged in continued acts of domestic violence, trial court's finding that the father had submitted three diluted drug screens was insufficient to support
                        a determination as to the likelihood of future neglect, and the trial court's finding that the father had not provided financially for the child, along with its determination that the father received SSI benefits and was not required
                        to pay child support, did not support its finding of neglect. In re K.N., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 274</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 861 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence supported the finding of neglect as to the mother's daughter; the mother did not act immediately to stop the daughter's sexual abuse by the mother's boyfriend, and the mother tried to discredit her daughter in therapy sessions and prioritized
                        her relationship with her boyfriend before her daughter's welfare. The mother did not demonstrate a willingness or ability to ensure her daughter was protected. In re S.M.L., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 21, 2020).

                    <p>
                        Evidence did not support the finding of neglect as to the mother's son; the trial court relied on instances of the daughter's past sexual abuse to adjudicate the son neglected, but no findings were made of any risk of physical, mental or emotional impairment
                        to the son or the presence of other factors supporting a conclusion that he was neglected. The only specific finding regarding the son was that he was happy and healthy. In re S.M.L., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 21, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Father could not contend that certain issues did not lead to the juvenile's adjudication as neglected because he stipulated to the findings of fact and consented to the child's adjudication as a neglected juvenile; therefore, one finding of fact, which
                        was stipulated to by the father in the adjudication order, supported another finding of fact in the order terminating the father's parental rights in the child. In re O.W.D.A., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Termination of the mother's rights on the grounds of neglect was supported by substantial evidence; the trial court determined that mother's last-minute progress was insufficient to outweigh her long-standing history of alcohol and substance abuse and
                        domestic violence, as well as the impact these behaviors had on the children, and it was not error for the trial court to find that there likely would be a repetition of neglect in the future should they be returned to mother's
                        care. In re H.A.J., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                        Nature of Proceedings. - As the district court division has exclusive original jurisdiction of Juvenile Code matters, actions under the former Juvenile Code (formerly <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa41s7A-516" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-516</a></cite>                        et seq.) are not special proceedings.

                        Jurisdiction. - The issuance and service of process is the means by which the court obtains jurisdiction; thus, where no summons was issued, the court acquired jurisdiction over neither the persons nor the subject matter of the action, and was without
                        authority to enter order adjudicating a juvenile as neglected. In re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 485 S.E.2d 623 (1997).

                        over the case. In re A.R.G., <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 392</cite>, 646 S.E.2d 349 (2007).

                        did not specifically state in the petition that the caseworker was an authorized representative of the director of the Department of Social Services, the caseworker's verification of the petition was sufficient for the trial court
                        to exercise jurisdiction over the case. In re D.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 654 S.E.2d 1 (2007).

                        In a case in which the court appointed custodians of a minor child filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child's mother, the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the custodians lacked standing. The custodians did not fit within any
                        of the requirements under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)</a></cite>, and contrary to their argument, their status as custodians of the minor child did not
                        give them the same rights as a guardian; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103</a></cite> referred to both custody and guardianship, and it could not be held that the words custody and judicially
                        appointed guardian as used in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103</a></cite> were not intended to have specific, distinct meanings. In re B.O., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 600,

                        Trial court had jurisdiction to hear a stepmother's petition for judicial review of the order finding that she was a responsible individual and placing her name on the Responsible Individuals List (RIL) because the child was 17 years old at the time the
                        stepmother struck him, and thus, her name was properly added to the RIL; the child's medical records contained numerous instances where his birthday was shown, and the stepmother did not argue that the birthdate was incorrect.

                        trial courts should consider the purposes of the Juvenile Code when determining whether intervention is necessary to protect the welfare of the child. In re R.R.N., <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 167</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Findings of Fact Required. - Trial court erred in concluding that a child was dependent because the trial court made no findings of fact concerning the mother's ability to provide care or supervision for the child or that the mother lacked an alternative
                        child care arrangement to support the court's conclusion that the child was dependent. In re E.C., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 621 S.E.2d 647 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in terminating parental rights on the ground of neglect because the termination order contained no finding of a probability of a repetition of the neglect, which led to the child's removal from the parents' care; the record contained
                        evidence that could support, although not compel, a finding of neglect, but without further fact-finding, the court of appeals could not determine whether the trial court's conclusions were supported by its findings. In re L.L.O.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 799 S.E.2d 59 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred by, in effect, removing custodial grandparents from a juvenile proceeding because (1) the grandparents were mandatory parties to the proceeding, and the court did not enter the findings statutorily required when discharging a party from
                        a proceeding. In re J.R.S., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 612, 813 S.E.2d 283 (2018).

                        Findings of Fact Conclusive on Appeal. - Mother's testimony during the adjudication hearing fully supported the trial court's challenged findings of fact, and therefore those findings were conclusive on appeal In re A.N.L.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 266, 714 S.E.2d 189 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Findings and Verbatim Allegations. - Findings in this neglect case contained some verbatim allegations, plus 15 additional findings that were not verbatim allegations and were properly considered; the trial court was cautioned that its order had to reflect
                        an adjudication, not mere one-sided recitations of allegations presented at the hearing. In re M.K., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 773 S.E.2d 535 (2015).

                        Definition of "Neglected Juvenile" Not Unconstitutional. - The statutory definition of a "neglected juvenile" in former G.S. 7A-517 was not unconstitutional by reason of vagueness, nor does it violate constitutional safeguards as to equal protection.

                        Former G.S. 7A-517(21) (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(15)</a></cite>) of this section is not unconstitutionally vague. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 394</cite>, 293

                    <p>
                        The determination of neglect requires the application of the legal principles set forth in former G.S. 7A-517(21) (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(15)</a></cite>) and is therefore
                        a conclusion of law; appellate review of a trial court's conclusions of law is limited to whether they are supported by findings of fact. In re Helms, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 491 S.E.2d 672 (1997).

                        Classification of Neglected Children Is Reasonable. - The classification of neglected children by former G.S. 7A-517 is founded upon reasonable distinctions, affects all persons similarly situated without discrimination, and has a reasonable relation
                        to the public peace, welfare and safety. In re Huber, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 291 S.E.2d 916, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>, 294 S.E.2d

                        "Abandonment" Defined. - Abandonment imports any willful or intentional conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child. Abandonment has also been defined
                        as willful neglect and refusal to perform the natural and legal obligations of parental care and support. It has been held that if a parent withholds his presence, his love, his care, the opportunity to display filial affection,
                        and willfully neglects to lend support and maintenance, such parent relinquishes all parental claims and abandons the child. In re APA, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 332, 296 S.E.2d 811 (1982).

                    <p>
                        Neglect Based on Abandonment. - Mother neglected child by way of abandonment where the mother had wilfully refused to perform her obligations as a parent, had withheld her presence, love, care, and opportunity to display filial affection from the child,
                        and failed to financially contribute to the support of the child for a significant period of time. In re Humphrey, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 533, 577 S.E.2d 421 (2003).

                        Abused Juvenile. - In an adjudication, disposition, and permanency planning order concluding that the son was an abused juvenile, because the binding findings of fact established that the son sustained multiple non-accidental injuries and the father was
                        responsible for the injuries, the trial court did not err in concluding that the son was an abused juvenile. In re J.M. &amp; J., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 804 S.E.2d 830 (2017), appeal

                        Trial court did not in finding that a child was an abused juvenile where she had undergone five invasive examinations before she was four years old based on the mother's and grandmother's claims of sexual abuse, and although two child welfare agencies
                        found no signs of physical or sexual abuse, they reported that the child displayed signs of emotional abuse. In re E.P.-L.M., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 4, 2020).

                        Lack of Parental Concern. - An individual's lack of parental concern for his child is simply an alternate way of stating that the individual has failed to exercise proper care, supervision, and discipline as to that child. Clark v. Williamson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 373 S.E.2d 317 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Any child whose physical, mental or emotional condition has been impaired or is in danger of becoming impaired as a result of the failure of his or her parent to exercise that degree of care consistent with the normative standards imposed upon parents
                        by society may be considered neglected. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 95, 306 S.E.2d 792 (1983).

                    <p>
                        A child who is found to have been disciplined so severely that bruises and internal abrasions result is a "neglected" juvenile. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 95, 306 S.E.2d 792 (1983).

                    <p>
                        To deprive a child of the opportunity for normal growth and development is perhaps the greatest neglect a parent can impose upon a child. In re Huber, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 291 S.E.2d 916, appeal dismissed
                        and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 223 (1982).

                    <p>
                        Refusal to Educate as Neglect. - It is fundamental that a child who receives proper care and supervision in modern times is provided a basic education. A child does not receive "proper care" and lives in an "environment injurious to his welfare" when
                        he is deliberately refused this education, and he is "neglected". In re McMillan, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 235, 226 S.E.2d 693 (1976); In re Devone, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite>                        57, 356 S.E.2d 389 (1987).

                        Failure to Provide Medical Care or Remedial Care Constitutes Neglect. - This section provides that if a child is not provided necessary medical care, it is neglected. In re Huber, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 453,
                        291 S.E.2d 916, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 223 (1982).

                        Child with a severe speech defect which could be treated by medical or other remedial care, as well as a hearing defect, which problems could be overcome with proper treatment and therapy which were available to child without expense to her mother, was
                        "neglected" where her mother refused to permit her to receive this opportunity to progress toward her full development. In re Huber, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 291 S.E.2d 916, appeal

                    <p>
                        A finding of neglect by clear and convincing evidence was proper where the children were kept at home, and they did not receive proper medical care, supervision, or adequate nutrition.

                        Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supported a conclusion that a child did not receive proper care and supervision, and that the neglect was likely to result in physical, mental, or emotional impairment, or a substantial risk of such impairment under

                        Trial court did not err in adjudicating the second child dependent and neglected as the mother was unable to provide for the second child's care or supervision and lacked an appropriate alternative child care arrangement, and her actions placed the child
                        at a substantial risk of some physical, mental, or emotional impairment because, while the second child was in the mother's custody, she continuously failed to obtain meaningful mental health services for the child that could have
                        prevented or mitigated the child's need for repeated hospitalizations at a psychiatric hospital; she greatly minimized and denied the seriousness of the child's condition; and the mother even exacerbated the child's condition.

                        Failure to Provide Clean Home and Child Care. - Failure of parents, during the three months additional time allowed to them to make improvements, to provide a clean and suitable home for their children and to provide for appropriate child care when they
                        were absent, was strong supporting evidence for the conclusion that the children were genuinely neglected within the terms of subdivision (21) of this section. In re Black, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite>                        106, 332 S.E.2d 85 (1985).

                        Trial court did not err by concluding that grounds existed to terminate a father's parental rights because the evidence and findings of fact supported its determination that the father lacked the willingness or ability to establish a safe home for his
                        child; the father's parental rights to another child had been involuntarily terminated, and his mental health concerns did not allow him to provide a safe home. In re N.G., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 891</cite>,

                        Neglect may be manifested in ways less tangible than failure to provide physical necessities. Therefore, on the question of neglect, the trial judge may consider, in addition, a parent's complete failure to provide the personal contact, love, and affection
                        that inheres in the parental relationship. In re APA, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 296 S.E.2d 811 (1982).

                        Findings Regarding Neglect. - Because the trial court's findings of fact support its legal conclusions that the juveniles were neglected, the lack of findings in the adjudication order regarding the mother's fault or culpability in contributing to the
                        adjudication of neglect was immaterial. In re A.L.T., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 774 S.E.2d 316 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Termination of the mother's parental rights based on neglect was proper; issues of inappropriate discipline and domestic violence remained, the mother had not secured her own housing, and the findings supported the conclusion that there was a high probability
                        of the repetition of neglect if the children were returned to the mother's care. In re C.M.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 803 S.E.2d 853 (2017).

                        Even assuming findings in the trial court's prior orders sufficed to support the corresponding adjudicatory findings, the findings did not support the conclusion that the children were neglected juveniles; the fact that the mother verbally attacked the
                        school bus driver and blocked children from boarding did not support a neglect determination, nor did the children's absences from school, which did not show the children were being denied an education. In re J.C.M.J.C., - N.C.

                        Unchallenged findings were sufficient to support a conclusion that the child was neglected where they established that the mother's improper care of the child and repeated allegations of sexual abuse exposed the child to harmful medical procedures, creating
                        an environment injurious to her welfare. In re E.P.-L.M., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 4, 2020).

                        Grounds existed to terminate the father's parental rights based on neglect where although the father had made some progress toward completing his court-ordered case plan, his success was extremely limited and insufficient in light of the child's placement
                        in state custody for over two years. In re J.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 772</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 44 (2020).

                        In a case in which the mother's sister transferred alcohol into water bottles, her brother grabbed some water bottles that he believed were unopened from the kitchen, the mother fed the child formula that she prepared using one of the water bottles, and
                        the child suffered acute alcohol intoxication, the findings of fact in the trial court's order did not support its conclusion of law that the child was a neglected juvenile because the findings, such as they were, supported a determination
                        that a tragic and unfortunate accident occurred - an accident which might have been preventable with the benefit of hindsight, but which the mother had no way of knowing would occur, nor had any means to prevent it, absent some

                        respondent's boyfriend had spanked her at church when she misbehaved, and had grabbed her face and hit her face when they arrived home; (4) that respondent's boyfriend had punched holes in the walls, and that he had once cracked
                        the car windshield with his fist while the children were in the vehicle; (5) that respondent was completely uncooperative with petitioner; (6) that respondent's son had a wound on his upper lip which respondent insisted was a cold

                        child in fact stated that respondent burned her; (3) the burns were serious, requiring prompt medical attention; (4) respondent did not seek treatment for the child's injuries and refused to permit social worker to do so; and (5)
                        the child was taken for treatment only upon the intervention of the sheriff's department, over respondent's opposition. In re Hayden, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 384 S.E.2d 558 (1989).

                        (2) the parents failed to furnish a detailed account or proper medical history to explain the child's injuries; (3) both parents knew that the child had a medical condition; (4) the second time the child was taken to the hospital

                        Trial court properly terminated the father's parental rights on the ground that the father neglected the children, because the father expressed some interest in visitation rights, but only if a paternity test showed that the father was one child's biological

                        of neglect and the likelihood of its continuation in the future, an appeals court held that the trial court's findings of fact, which included a 16 year old mother's prior adjudication of neglect, marijuana use, and her demonstrated
                        inability to care for an infant, supported the conclusion that the child was a neglected child. In re E.N.S., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 146, 595 S.E.2d 167 (2004), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 189</cite>,

                        sufficient evidence to uphold the neglect and abuse adjudication of a mother's infant child based on the mother's (1) whereabouts to have been unknown upon the baby's discharge from the hospital, (2) testing positive for marijuana
                        since the adjudication hearing, (3) refusal to attend several substance abuse assessments, (4) failure to make progress on her psychological problems, and (5) abuse and neglect adjudication regarding an older daughter. In re M.J.G.,

                        physically harmed the minor child by hitting her with a belt and failed to consistently attend assigned mental health sessions as she only attended five of 10 sessions, and finding of fact six, that the mother failed to regularly
                        visit the minor child, the substantive evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that the minor child was neglected pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(15)</a></cite>.

                        Evidence sufficiently supported the trial court's finding that the mother's children were neglected, including that the mother delayed taking the one child for medical treatment for the one child's bruises because of the mother's fear that the county
                        social services agency would take custody of the children and that the other two children had disciplinary and developmental problems while in the mother's care. In re C.P., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite>                        698, 641 S.E.2d 13 (2007).

                        by clear and convincing evidence; indeed, the evidence showed that the minor child's older sibling was adjudicated abused and neglected because the mother's boyfriend, who was cohabitating with the mother at the time of the abuse,
                        pled guilty to several felony sex offenses. In re D.S.A., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 641 S.E.2d 18 (2007).

                        Adjudication of neglect was supported by evidence that the mother admitted to "thumping" the five-year-old daughter in the face hard enough with a finger to leave a bruise shaped like the mother's finger, the bruising of the four-year-old child's upper
                        leg was from a severe blow delivered by his stepfather with a brush, respondents' effort to convince the younger child to lie about what happened to cause the bruise on his leg, the fact that the older child told the social worker
                        that the bruise on her face came from falling in the bathtub, the same lie respondents tried to exact from the younger child, and the mother's admission that she left the younger alone in the bathtub every night for 20 to 30 minutes.

                        Findings relating to the prior adjudication of neglect and subsequent termination of parental rights as to the parents' first child and the parents' failure to comply with their case plan, when combined with the parents' failure to acknowledge culpability
                        for their first child's injuries, supported the conclusion that the child was a neglected juvenile based on the high risk of future abuse or neglect.

                        Termination of a mother's parental rights to her two minor children was upheld on appeal where the unchallenged findings of fact made by the trial court established by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in the record that the mother had willfully
                        left her children in foster care without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their placement. The findings supporting that conclusion included: the children were in foster care for over 12 months; the
                        mother missed seven out of eleven appointments and failed to complete a substance abuse treatment program; missed five out of ten parenting classes; tested positive for drugs several times; failed to establish a permanent residence
                        and had been moving around from family and friends for a total of eight separate residences; failed to obtain employment; and failed to stay in contact with the Department of Social Services. In re A.R.H.B.,

                        Termination of a father's parental rights was upheld on appeal since the father failed to challenge any of the findings of fact made by the trial court, namely that prior to the date the motion to terminate his parental rights was filed, he never established
                        paternity over the minor child at issue, never legitimated the child by statute or marriage, nor had he provided any financial support. In re A.R.H.B., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 211, 651

                        a required parenting program, failed to attend individual counseling, and failed to address her substance abuse issues, the evidence supported the conclusion that the children were neglected under

                        Termination order was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence based on the mother's unfitness to have custody, and the overwhelming evidence of neglect, including improper supervision of her children, inappropriate discipline, and the severely
                        unsanitary condition of the family's home due to the many different farm animals living therein, as well as a roach infestation. Further, given evidence of the significant positive progress that the children made since they were
                        taken from the mother's custody, termination was in the children's best interests. In re J.A.P., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 659 S.E.2d 14 (2008).

                        Trial court did not err in terminating the parental rights of a mother and father because the record provided ample competent evidence to support the trial court's factual findings, and the findings of fact supported the trial court's conclusion of law,
                        that their child was neglected and that it was probable that the neglect would be repeated. In re D.D., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (June 16, 2009).

                        Clear and convincing evidence showed that children were neglected because the children were substantially at risk due to (1) one child's life-threatening injuries and the children's parents' explanations that were inconsistent with the injuries, (2) the
                        instability and volatility of the children's living conditions, (3) the parents' deceptive natures, and (4) living in an injurious environment that involved violence. In re C.M., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite>                        53, 678 S.E.2d 794 (2009).

                        despite the progress the father made in a rehabilitation program during his incarceration. The father had exhibited a pattern of recovery and relapse regarding his addiction to crack-cocaine and marijuana, and the trial court properly
                        considered that his success at rehabilitation while incarcerated was not indicative of how he would deal with his addiction once released. In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 715 S.E.2d 563 (2011).

                        Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supported a trial court's termination of a mother's parental rights to her four-year-old child, based on neglect under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1)</a></cite>,
                        because the mother failed to maintain stable employment and housing, had continued dependence on others to meet her basic needs, and the trial court had discretion to consider evidence that the mother's older child had been adjudicated
                        a neglected child, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(15)</a></cite>; since the mother's release from jail in April 2008, she had five jobs and eight residences. In re C.G.R.,

                        Trial court did not err by concluding that children were neglected juveniles pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(15)</a></cite> because the children had never received any medical
                        care while in the parents' home, and the father had beaten one of the children; the trial court properly considered evidence tending to show that the children's younger sister was an abused or neglected juvenile in determining
                        whether the father and mother had neglected the children, and its findings of fact clearly established that the children lived in an environment that was injurious to their welfare.

                        Sufficient evidence supported the trial court's adjudication of neglect of a five-year-old child because the mother no longer attended mental health therapy, declined free daycare, did not allow access to her records to determine whether she was compliant
                        with her mental health medication, and the mother's refusal to cooperate with the Department of Social Services placed the child at risk of substantial harm; one erroneous finding of fact by the trial court, which was based on
                        hearsay, did not constitute reversible error. In re T.R.T., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 737 S.E.2d 823 (2013).

                        District court did not err when it adjudicated both children neglected juveniles because the mother placed the children at a substantial risk of physical, mental, or emotional impairment as a consequence of her failure to provide proper care, supervision,
                        or discipline as she felt so overwhelmed that she could not care for the children that she left them with their father, a person she believed was a substance abuser, without even interacting with him in person to assess his sobriety
                        and current fitness to care for the children; and the mother had disciplined the younger child in such an inappropriate manner that he had been adjudicated an abused juvenile and the mother was charged with misdemeanor child abuse.

                        Trial court's determination that a child was a neglected juvenile was supported by the evidence because its findings supported the conclusion that the child was not receiving proper care and supervision under the mother's care and that he was living in
                        an environment injurious to his welfare; the trial court found that the mother had problems with drugs and that she had previously injured the child while abusing drugs.

                        Competent evidence supported the trial court's findings in part that: the father engaged in aggressive and violent behaviors in the home, he hit one child in the mouth causing a busted lip, and he struck the other child at least once; these findings showed
                        that the children lived in an environment injurious to their welfare and that they were at a substantial risk of physical, mental, or emotional impairment. In re A.L.T., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite>                        443, 774 S.E.2d 316 (2015).

                        Findings supported the conclusion that all four children were neglected, as there was ample evidence to support the finding that the mother sustained bruises from her fall after being pushed by the father, the trial court found that the youngest two children
                        did not need to be in the middle of a fight to be subjected to an injurious environment, and the evidence supported the finding that all four children knew about the physical altercations; the trial court did not act under a misapprehension
                        of the law, as the findings sufficiently detailed the impacts the father's violence with the mother had on the children. In re M.K., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 773 S.E.2d 535 (2015).

                        Child was properly adjudicated as neglected because (1) the child's male cousin's sexual improprieties with the child showed a lack of proper care, and (2) the child was present when adults used marijuana, slept with the cousin, and was passed between
                        adults with no determination of fitness, showing substantial risk of harm. In re T.N.G., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 781 S.E.2d 93 (2015).

                        Because the evidence supported the trial court's findings that a minor child's father indicated an unwillingness to enter into a family services agreement, had never met with the child, and had no bond with the child, there was evidence to support the
                        trial court's conclusion that the child was neglected by the father. Thus, there was evidence to terminate the father's parental rights on this statutory ground. In re C.L.S., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite>                        75, 781 S.E.2d 680 (2016).

                        When the department took nonsecure custody of the children, all five were in the care of their grandmother, having no home, no electricity, no plumbing, and no food, and thus neglect was the same for all five children, and the availability of the boys'
                        father, while relevant to an adjudication of dependency, had no bearing on an adjudication of neglect; the trial court could not have found that some of the children were neglected while others were not, and the trial court was
                        to adjudicate the three boys, as well as the girls, neglected juveniles. In re Q.A., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 781 S.E.2d 862 (2016).

                        Findings were sufficient for the trial court to conclude that the child was a neglected juvenile; he suffered an actual impairment due to his exposure to controlled substances, and the mother's erratic behavior and disregard for the domestic violence
                        protection order against the father exposed the child to a substantial risk of impairment, and it was proper for a trial court to adjudicate a juvenile neglected, even if the juvenile never actually resided in the parent's home,
                        as was the case here. In re G.T., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 791 S.E.2d 274 (2016), aff'd, 808 S.E.2d 142, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 1022 (N.C. 2017).

                        Trial court's findings supported its conclusion that respondents' child was a neglected juvenile in that respondents failed to provide proper supervision for the child. Even if inflicted by the child on himself, the child's injuries were nevertheless
                        the result of physical harm by other than accidental means that respondents allowed to occur due to their failure to maintain the child's medication and provide adequate supervision to meet the child's special needs. In re K.B.,

                        Adjudication that the child was a neglected juvenile was affirmed because the prior orders entered into the record were not the sole basis for the trial court's decision; the child presently faced substantial risk in her living environment as the mother
                        continued to fail to acknowledge her role in her rights being terminated to her six other children, she denied the need for any services for the child's case, and she became involved with the father, who had engaged in domestic
                        violence, even though domestic violence was one of the reasons her other children were removed from her home; and the mother had not made sufficient progress in recognizing domestic violence warning signs, and in accurately assessing
                        poor decisions from the past. In re J.A.M., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 1</cite>, 822 S.E.2d 693 (2019).

                        Child was neglected because the child's father was convicted for sexually abusing children and denied responsibility for those convictions, had persistent and serious mental health issues that affected the father's ability to parent the child, and lacked
                        stable housing until shortly before the termination hearing. Furthermore, the district court found that there was a high probability that a repetition of neglect would occur in the future if the child were to be placed with the
                        father. In re N.P., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 61</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 801 (2020).

                        Termination of the father's parental rights was proper on the ground of neglect because he failed to appreciably address his substance abuse issues; he had only shown an extended abstinence from cocaine use while incarcerated; he did not complete substance
                        abuse treatment; he incurred serious felony charges during the pendency of the case and was convicted of discharging a firearm into occupied property; during his incarceration, he made no attempt to contact the child and had limited
                        contact with the Department of Social Services; and he could not use his incarceration as a shield against a conclusion that there was a probability of future neglect. In re A.S.T., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                        Evidence supported a finding of neglect under former G.S. 7A-517(21) where the trial court found that the respondent parents intended to live with their new infant in the home of the maternal grandparents where their previous child died; where the child's
                        father had been convicted of causing the infant's death; where the mother had been advised regarding the cause of this non-accidental death but continued to support the father's version of events; where the parents had neither
                        expressed nor exhibited any concern for the future safety of their newborn in their home; and where the father "extended most of the care for the juvenile" during the visits of the parents with the child. In re McLean,

                        Evidence Insufficient to Show Neglect. - Where at the time of termination proceedings, father was employed in a steady job for the first time in a number of years, had been alcohol free for over two years, had reduced his child support arrearage from
                        $15,200 to $2,200, and had been paying $750 a month in child support ($500 in arrears and $250 to keep current), insufficient evidence existed to support a finding of neglect. Bost v. Van Nortwick,

                        The trial court's findings of fact did not support its conclusion that a child was neglected, where the trial court's finding that the mother did not provide the child with proper care, supervision, or discipline was more properly denominated a conclusion
                        of law, and the court did not find that the child was impaired or at substantial risk of impairment. In re Everette, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 514 S.E.2d 523 (1999).

                        Anonymous call, reporting a naked child two years of age, unsupervised in a driveway, did not, standing alone, constitute a report of abuse, neglect, or dependency, so the statutory investigative mandate was not properly invoked against the parents of
                        the child that refused to let a caseworker privately interview the child or the child's siblings; the determination of neglect required the application of the legal principles set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(15)</a></cite>,
                        and was therefore a conclusion of law. In re Stumbo, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 279</cite>, 582 S.E.2d 255 (2003).

                        attributed to rolling off the couch as the father contended happened when he went to get a bottle for the infant, the proof was insufficient to show that the mother had neglected the infant; she was not at home when the incident

                        of fact indicated that the mother was not at the home when the child suffered his injuries; (3) the child was developing appropriately and had never missed any doctor's appointments; (4) there were no allegations, evidence, or

                        the trial court in its ruling properly entered uncontested findings of fact that: (1) the father possessed a gun, but did not point it at the mother or the children during a domestic disturbance; (2) the parents' three oldest children
                        left their residence with the father, but no kidnapping was reported, and an Amber Alert was not issued; (3) the district attorney's office dismissed the charges against the father for communicating threats to and assault by pointing

                        Since the time the petition to terminate the father's rights was filed, the father was released from incarceration, had obtained full-time employment, had family medical insurance available through the father's employer, and had
                        a furnished apartment which was near the father's work and schools for the children. In re G.B.R., <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 309, 725 S.E.2d 387 (2012).

                        Findings of fact did not support a trial court's conclusion that the parents' child and nieces were neglected because, even if it were assumed that a parent abused the step-daughter of the parent's cousin in the parents' home where the child and nieces
                        lived, this fact alone did not support a conclusion that the children were neglected. The trial court also failed to make any findings of fact regarding other factors that would have supported a conclusion that the abuse would
                        have been repeated. In re J.C.B., <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 641, 757 S.E.2d 487 (2014).

                        make any adjudicatory findings concerning the father's alleged failings; the trial court found no other grounds existed upon which to base termination of the father's parental rights. In re J.D.A.D.,

                        Children were held to be abused juveniles, where the court found that the children had suffered serious emotional damage as the result of their parents' acrimonious marital dispute as the older daughter exhibited symptoms of depression and had entertained
                        suicidal thoughts, and the younger daughter testified about the severe anxiety her parents' actions caused her. Powers v. Powers, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 37, 502 S.E.2d 398 (1998).

                        The trial court's findings of fact regarding child's status as an abused juvenile were supported by clear and convincing evidence where the child testified that her father had shown her a picture of a woman wearing a see-through dress, the child's friend
                        drew a picture in court of what she had seen, i.e. the father's anatomy, a social worker testified that the child had told her that her father had "asked her to touch his penis," and a doctor testified that the child had told her

                        Evidence that the mother (1) knew of the father's violent and abusive nature and alcohol abuse, (2) failed to take the steps necessary to protect the minor children, (3) witnessed many of the incidents where the father would consume alcohol to excess
                        and act out upon the children, and (4) allowed the father to drive the children after the father had consumed a large quantity of alcohol sufficiently supported a determination that the mother allowed to be created a substantial
                        risk of serious physical injury to the children other than by accidental means, and thus, supported a finding of abuse as to the mother. In re M.G., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 536, 653 S.E.2d

                        In terminating parental rights, the trial court only needed to find one basis for termination pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>, and the trial court based its termination
                        on detailed findings and conclusions as to ongoing, severe and repeated abuse of the child, who suffered injuries that were not accidental (including fractures), who had failed to thrive, and who was an abused juvenile as defined

                        by her father because the trial court properly evaluated a physician's testimony that the child's physical condition was consistent with child sexual abuse; the child's testimony that her father raped her repeatedly over the course
                        of a year was corroborated by the physician, who found that her vaginal trauma was consistent with forced penetration, and the child's testimony, along with the physician's findings, were sufficient for the trial judge to find
                        that the child was abused pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(1)(d)</a></cite>. In re K.W., <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 646, 666 S.E.2d 490 (2008).

                        life-threatening supported legal conclusions that the child was abused in that a person responsible for the child's care allowed a serious physical injury to be inflicted on the child by non-accidental means and created or allowed

                        while the boyfriend brandished a firearm, struck with a belt all over his body, and repeatedly told that he was possessed by demons, and thus, the second child lived in an injurious environment and faced a substantial risk of physical,

                        by other than accidental means; the stepmother was a responsible individual because she was a parent, guardian, custodian, or caretaker, and she abused the child. In re Patron, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite>                        375, 792 S.E.2d 853 (2016).

                        Evidence before the trial court was sufficient to support its findings of abuse and neglect where three physicians, two of whom were experts in the area of child abuse, testified that the juvenile was the victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a form
                        of child abuse with a substantial risk of morbidity and even mortality, possibly induced by the mother either smothering the juvenile or administering a toxin. In re McCabe, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite>                        673, 580 S.E.2d 69 (2003).

                        cooperative in the investigation and did not delay in seeking medical attention, did not support the conclusion that respondents abused or allowed abuse of the child. Not only did the Department of Social Services fail to check

                        Evidence Insufficient to Show Both Neglect And Dependence. - Trial court erred in adjudicating a mother's child neglected and dependent because the evidence and supported findings demonstrated the mother suffered from mental health issues, but was attending
                        some treatment, while her older children were removed from her care, the findings were insufficiently detailed to determine the grounds for their removal, and the mother placed the child with a couple with the assistance of the

                        Parental Rights Properly Terminated. - The following findings supported the court's conclusion that a mother's parental rights should be terminated for neglect: (1) The child was in the bottom 5% of children in her age group in weight; (2) the mother
                        failed to supervise her properly; (3) the child was allowed to remain in dirty diapers and to drink out of discarded bottles; (4) the child lived in an environment injurious to her health and welfare; and (5) the mother suffered
                        mental problems resulting in inability to care for herself and her child. In re Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 330 S.E.2d 513 (1985).

                        Even if there is no evidence of neglect at the time of the termination proceeding, parental rights may still be terminated if there is a showing of a past adjudication of neglect and the trial court finds by clear and convincing evidence a probability

                        was supported by evidence that the parents' relationship involved aggression and violence, that neither had learned to control their aggressive tendencies, that their conduct was harmful to the children, and that termination of
                        parental rights was in the children's best interests. In the Matter of T.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 556, 738 S.E.2d 759 (2013), review denied, 743 S.E.2d 194, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 538 (2013), review denied, 2013

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err by terminating a mother's parental rights to three children on grounds of neglect because there was evidence of prior neglect, the neglect was ongoing, a substantial probability existed the children would be neglected or abused
                        in the future, and the mother continued to associate with individuals who abused her or the children. In re D.A.H.-C., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 742 S.E.2d 836 (2013).

                        District court's findings supported the conclusion that the father's parental rights were subject to termination as the child would likely be neglected again if the child were returned to the father's care because the mother struggled with basic parenting
                        skills and relied on the father as a main support for parenting; the father was willing to leave the child alone in the care of the mother even though the mother was unfit for such accountability; the parents continued to be in
                        constant marital discord even while having supervised visits with the child; and the parents intended to remain together despite the aforementioned problems. In re Z.V.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 207</cite>,

                        The trial court's decision adjudicating a mother's son as a neglected and dependant juvenile was not supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence because the trial court's order (1) did not distinguish between findings of fact and conclusions of
                        law, (2) did not reference any of the several statutory grounds for determining neglect, and (3) was based on an order adjudicating the son's siblings neglected in another case, which had been remanded for adequate findings of
                        fact and conclusions of law. In re T.M.M., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 801, 606 S.E.2d 416 (2005).

                        Absence of parent. - The respondent/mother's failure to be present at the adjudicatory hearing did not relieve the trial court of its duty to find, based on competent evidence, that the allegations of neglect contained in the petition were supported by
                        clear and convincing evidence; nor was the father's purported consent sufficient to support a finding of neglect. Thrift v. Buncombe County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite>                        559, 528 S.E.2d 394 (2000).

                        Reasonable Efforts Used Toward Reunification. - There was ample evidence showing that the Department of Social Services used reasonable efforts towards reunification, and thus the mother's argument that the trial court did not have the evidence it needed
                        to find her behavior was willful or that her progress was not reasonable for termination purposes was unavailing; there was clear evidence to support findings that the mother willfully left the children in foster care for more
                        than 12 months and failed to make reasonable progress. In re A.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 812 S.E.2d 875 (2018).

                        District court erred when it adjudicated both children dependent juveniles because the father was able to provide proper care for the children as the county department of social services had found his home a safe and suitable placement, and the children
                        had adjusted well to the placement and their new school. In re H.H., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 431, 767 S.E.2d 347 (2014).

                        no allegations and presented no evidence that the father, although a minor, was unable to provide or arrange for the care and supervision of the child. In re V.B., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                        340, 768 S.E.2d 867 (2015).

                        a child, to the parent from whom the child had been taken, without a hearing in which a court found that the child would receive proper care in a safe home, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(19)</a></cite>,
                        a trial court erred in changing custody of a child from a father to the mother because the court was required to find, but did not find, that the child would receive from the mother the necessary proper care and supervision in
                        a safe home, particularly in light of prior evidence that domestic violence had occurred in the home. In re H.S.F., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 628 S.E.2d 416 (2006).

                        Return of Child to Parents Did Not Make the Issue of Neglect Moot. - Although a father regained full custody of his child, since there were collateral legal consequences that could arise from a neglect adjudication, such as a determination of whether
                        another child was neglected, the appeal from the adjudication of neglect should not have been dismissed as moot. In re A.K., <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 449</cite>, 628 S.E.2d 753 (2006).

                        most findings in the neglect adjudication; the trial court was not bound by the rules of evidence at the custody hearing and respondents had no right to appeal, and to allow the trial court to find adjudicatory facts by taking
                        judicial notice of the court's prior findings undermined the procedural safeguards for adjudications. In re J.C.M.J.C., - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 670 (2019).

                        Nature of Proceedings. - As the district court division has exclusive original jurisdiction of Juvenile Code matters, actions under the former Juvenile Code (formerly <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa41s7A-516" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-516</a></cite>                        et seq.) are not special proceedings.

                        Petition of Continuing Jurisdiction. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over children as of September 26, 1984, when service of summons was completed on parent, and on September 27, 1984, entered an order allowing Department of Social Services
                        (DSS) to retain temporary and legal custody of the children, retained continuing jurisdiction over the children. In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).

                        Jurisdiction over Juveniles. - Where defendant was twelve or thirteen at the time he committed the felony of crime against nature, but had subsequently become an adult, the district court had exclusive original jurisdiction, because for the purposes of
                        determining subject matter jurisdiction over a juvenile, age at the time of the alleged offense governs. State v. Dellinger, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 93</cite>, 468 S.E.2d 218 (1996).

                        Where juvenile was temporarily living with his uncle in North Carolina he was found to reside in North Carolina, thus permitting disposition of delinquency petitions in the district where the acts allegedly occurred, even though the juvenile's mother,
                        who resided in the District of Columbia, had custody of him. In re Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 122, 510 S.E.2d 190 (1999).

                        Trial court had jurisdiction to hear a stepmother's petition for judicial review of the order finding that she was a responsible individual and placing her name on the Responsible Individuals List (RIL) because the child was 17 years old at the time the
                        stepmother struck him, and thus, her name was properly added to the RIL; the child's medical records contained numerous instances where his birthday was shown, and the stepmother did not argue that the birthdate was incorrect.

                        Jurisdiction over Neglect and Dependency Proceedings. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter when the summons was served upon mother, although it was not served upon father, as required by former G.S. 7A-565, had the authority
                        to decide the issue of neglect and dependency of three children. In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court had authority pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba02s7B-200ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-200(a)(6)</a></cite> to issue an ex parte order directing a mother to cease interference with a department's juvenile
                        investigation concerning her children; however, where no request for nonsecure custody was presented and no petition alleging that the children were neglected was filed, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award custody of the
                        children to their father. In re K.C.G., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 615 S.E.2d 76 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter orders finding the mother's four minor children to be abused an neglected after the county social services department of the neighboring county, due to a conflict the county social services department
                        had, conducted an investigation and found that allegations of abuse and neglect by the mother's church and the caretaker of the children were unfounded; once an official finding that no abuse and neglect had occurred, the trial
                        court lost the authority to declare that it had occurred and to determine that the four minor children should be removed from the custody of the caretaker. In re S.D.A., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite>                        354, 612 S.E.2d 362 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        District court, in adjudicating a child neglected, was not limited to considering only those circumstances occurring within its district. To hold otherwise would allow abusive and neglectful parents to avoid court intervention by simply moving from county
                        to county. In re E.C., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 621 S.E.2d 647 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Failure of the director of a county department of social services to sign and verify before a notary, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-403ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-403(a)</a></cite>, a petition for a finding
                        that a minor child was a neglected juvenile rendered the petition fatally deficient and inoperative to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court; because there was no evidence in the record suggesting later filings
                        sufficient to invoke subject matter jurisdiction as to the lower court's subsequent order from a review hearing, the trial court erred in proceeding on the matter due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In re T.R.P.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 541, 619 S.E.2d 525 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court had jurisdiction over a child's mother and father where both parents were properly served with the summons and the petition alleged that the child was neglected. In re M.B., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite>                        572, 635 S.E.2d 8 (2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a trial court did not completely fill out form orders granting an agency temporary nonsecure custody of a mother's children, by failing to specify the statutory grounds for nonsecure custody in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-503" target="_self">G.S. 7B-503</a></cite>,
                        the court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction to subsequently enter orders terminating the mother's parental rights to the children because (1) the court generally had jurisdiction over this type of case, under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba02s7B-200ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-200(a)(4)</a></cite> and 7B-201(a), (2) the court acquired jurisdiction over the children and the mother when an agency filed petitions under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-401" target="_self">G.S. 7B-401</a></cite>                        alleging the children were neglected and dependent juveniles, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(9)</a></cite> and (15), pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-405" target="_self">G.S. 7B-405</a></cite>,
                        and (3) the failure to fully complete the form orders did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction, as it was not alleged that the court did not observe the criteria for such orders in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-504" target="_self">G.S. 7B-504</a></cite>                        and 7B-506(a). In re T.P., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 723, 678 S.E.2d 781 (2009).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a case in which a district terminated the parental rights of a mother and a father, the mother and the father unsuccessfully argued on appeal that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to act upon a motion in the cause to reassume custody
                        by appellee, a county Department of Social Services, because the district court terminated its jurisdiction over the juvenile when it ordered the case closed. Closing a case did not mean the same thing as terminating jurisdiction,
                        and each was a separate action with distinct consequences; once jurisdiction of the court attached to a child custody matter, it existed for all time until the cause was fully and completely determined. In re S.T.P.,

                        County department of social services had standing to file a juvenile petition alleging that a child was a neglected and dependent juvenile because the petition was properly verified and filed by an authorized representative of "a county director of social
                        services"; the statutory sections governing "parties" and "venue" did not mandate dismissal of the juvenile petition. In re A.P., <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 14</cite>, 812 S.E.2d 840 (2018).

                        Child custody action was not pending when a neglect proceeding was initiated because as the juvenile court obtained jurisdiction over the children, the juvenile court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction unless jurisdiction was terminated by order of
                        the court; at the time the father filed the civil custody action, the trial court had no jurisdiction over the child custody action because of the already-pending neglect proceeding. McMillan v. McMillan, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d

                        Trial Court Had No Authority to Act Where No Request for Relief in Motion - Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter an order on the county Department of Social Services' (DSS) "motion in the cause," which was made at the previous direction
                        of the trial court for DSS to petition for termination of a mother's parental rights, where the motion lacked any request for relief, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,

                        Trial court had authority to assert jurisdiction over child who had relocated to North Carolina from Florida. - Under former G.S. 50A-3(a)(3)(ii), the emergency jurisdiction provision of the UCCJA, where child was present in Durham County at the time
                        the petition was filed alleging that she had been sexually abused; however, the trial court erred by failing to contact the Florida court that had previously exercised jurisdiction over the custody of the child to determine if
                        that court would exercise jurisdiction, prior to attempting to change custody. In re Malone, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 338, 498 S.E.2d 836 (1998).

                        The trial court had jurisdiction to enter a temporary nonsecure custody order. - Placing children who had been visiting noncustodial parent in North Carolina, but whose "home state" under the former UCCJA was Iowa, with DSS where there was a reasonable
                        factual basis to believe that one child had been sexually abused and hospitalized for depression and the other child had been physically abused and was hospitalized for stress disorder, pending application to home state determine

                        Jurisdiction to Issue Nonsecure Custody Order. - County department of social services (DSS) had no right to appeal the trial court's denial of the court's motion to review the foster care board rate provisions of a nonsecure custody order under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1001ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1001(a)(1)</a></cite>, which permitted appeal from any order finding absence of jurisdiction, as the trial court never ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction
                        to decide DSS's motion. Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-506ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7B-506(d)</a></cite>, 7B-200(a), the trial court clearly had jurisdiction to enter a nonsecure custody order; and, assuming arguendo
                        that the court erred in the scope of the court's order for board payments to foster parents, this did not necessarily deprive the court of jurisdiction. In re A.T., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 662 S.E.2d 917

                        Trial Court Lacked Jurisdiction in Termination of Parental Rights Action Where Juvenile Petition Not Properly Filed. - In a termination of parental rights action, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to conduct the permanency planning and review hearings
                        because the Department of Social Services failed to file a proper juvenile petition consistent with the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-402ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-402(a)</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-403ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-403(a)</a></cite>, and thus no juvenile abuse, neglect, or dependency action was ever commenced.

                    <p>
                        Even where the juvenile petition filed by the county social services department failed to attach an affidavit as to the status of the minor child, the trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the minor child's neglect and dependency proceeding;
                        although the better practice was to attach the affidavit, the failure to file the affidavit did not by itself divest the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re D.S.A., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite>                        715, 641 S.E.2d 18 (2007).

                        Power to Order Sex Offender Treatment. - The district court had power to order the Department of Human Resources, Division of Youth Services to give sex offender treatment to an adolescent found delinquent because of sex offenses and subsequently to deny
                        the conditional release of that adolescent because treatment had not been in compliance with that mandate. In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 743</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 798 (1991).

                        Procedure upon Finding Juvenile in Contempt. - The trial court was not authorized to summarily commit a child under 16 to state custody upon finding her in contempt of an order entered for engaging in undisciplined and non-criminal behavior, but was required
                        to follow specific statutory provisions applicable to children of that age. Taylor v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 508 S.E.2d 289 (1998).

                        placement reviews. In re Dexter, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 553 S.E.2d 922 (2001).

                        Jurisdiction over Neglect and Dependency Proceedings. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter when the summons was served upon mother, although it was not served upon father, as required by former G.S. 7A-565, had the authority
                        to decide the issue of neglect and dependency of three children. In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).

                        Failure of the director of a county department of social services to sign and verify before a notary, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-403ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-403(a)</a></cite>, a petition for a finding
                        that a minor child was a neglected juvenile rendered the petition fatally deficient and inoperative to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court; because there was no evidence in the record suggesting later filings
                        sufficient to invoke subject matter jurisdiction as to the lower court's subsequent order from a review hearing, the trial court erred in proceeding on the matter due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In re T.R.P.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 541, 619 S.E.2d 525 (2005).

                        When a trial court did not completely fill out form orders granting an agency temporary nonsecure custody of a mother's children, by failing to specify the statutory grounds for nonsecure custody in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-503" target="_self">G.S. 7B-503</a></cite>,
                        the court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction to subsequently enter orders terminating the mother's parental rights to the children because (1) the court generally had jurisdiction over this type of case, under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba02s7B-200ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-200(a)(4)</a></cite> and 7B-201(a), (2) the court acquired jurisdiction over the children and the mother when an agency filed petitions under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-401" target="_self">G.S. 7B-401</a></cite>                        alleging the children were neglected and dependent juveniles, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(9)</a></cite> and (15), pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-405" target="_self">G.S. 7B-405</a></cite>,

                        Child custody action was not pending when a neglect proceeding was initiated because as the juvenile court obtained jurisdiction over the children, the juvenile court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction unless jurisdiction was terminated by order of
                        the court; at the time the father filed the civil custody action, the trial court had no jurisdiction over the child custody action because of the already-pending neglect proceeding. McMillan v. McMillan, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d

                        Retention of Continuing Jurisdiction. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over children as of September 26, 1984, when service of summons was completed on parent, and on September 27, 1984, entered an order allowing Department of Social Services
                        (DSS) to retain temporary and legal custody of the children, retained continuing jurisdiction over the children. In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).

                        In a case in which a district terminated the parental rights of a mother and a father, the mother and the father unsuccessfully argued on appeal that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to act upon a motion in the cause to reassume custody
                        by appellee, a county Department of Social Services, because the district court terminated its jurisdiction over the juvenile when it ordered the case closed. Closing a case did not mean the same thing as terminating jurisdiction,
                        and each was a separate action with distinct consequences; once jurisdiction of the court attached to a child custody matter, it existed for all time until the cause was fully and completely determined. In re S.T.P.,

        Jurisdiction Terminated.
       </b> - Trial court did not err in asserting jurisdiction over a child custody action after a juvenile proceeding was terminated because the court had subject-matter jurisdiction to consider the father's custody claim once
                        he invoked jurisdiction by filing a motion; the juvenile order terminated the jurisdiction of the juvenile court over the child and, thus, the legal status of the juvenile and the custodial rights of the parties reverted to the
                        status they were before the juvenile petition was filed. McMillan v. McMillan, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 692 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Effect of Voluntary Dismissal of First Termination Petition. - Fact that county department of social services had dismissed a prior petition for termination of a mother's parental rights did not preclude a subsequent petition since the best interests
                        of the children was always the primary focus, with no procedural rule barring the court's continuing jurisdiction over such a matter. In re L.O.K., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 621 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction Until 18 or Emancipated. - Although a trial court in a custody dispute ended the custody of a county department of social services, the court did not err in retaining jurisdiction to conduct period review hearings, despite a father's claim
                        that the court, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906(d)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>),
                        the court was relieved of the duty to conduct such reviews after custody was awarded to the father; in deciding a custody case under G.S. 7A-657, the almost-identical predecessor to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906</a></cite>                        (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>), the state's supreme court had already ruled that the relevant statutory language meant only that a trial court had a right
                        to terminate its jurisdiction, but a trial court was not required to do so. Further, in the context of the Juvenile Code, North Carolina, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba02s7B-201" target="_self">G.S. 7B-201</a></cite> provided
                        that once a court obtained jurisdiction over a juvenile, that jurisdiction continued until terminated by a court order or until the juvenile reached the age of 18 years or was otherwise emancipated, and the parties' child was not
                        yet 18 or emancipated. In re H.S.F., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 628 S.E.2d 416 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Trial court had jurisdiction to hear a stepmother's petition for judicial review of the order finding that she was a responsible individual and placing her name on the Responsible Individuals List (RIL) because the child was 17 years old at the time the
                        stepmother struck him, and thus, her name was properly added to the RIL; the child's medical records contained numerous instances where his birthday was shown, and the stepmother did not argue that the birthdate was incorrect.

                    <p>
                        Father's appeal was moot because the trial court's order changing the permanent plan for his child was rendered moot when she reached the age of majority, which deprived the trial court of any further jurisdiction over the matter, the father conceded
                        that the legal effect of the order did not have any collateral consequences, the case did not present anything so exceptionally important to the public interest that it should be treated as different from all other juvenile cases,
                        the capable-of-repetition exception did not apply to legal errors in fact findings and legal conclusions that were particular to the case. In re A.K.G., - N.C. App. - , 841 S.E.2d 317 (2020).

        Jurisdiction for Modifying Custody.
       </b> - Trial court did not err in granting a mother legal and primary physical custody because the court was permitted to make an initial child custody determination since the juvenile court in the neglect proceeding returned
                        custody to the parties; in the absence of an existing permanent child custody order, the trial court was not required to find or conclude that there existed a substantial change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the child

                        Report Did Not Constitute Report of Abuse, Neglect, or Dependency - Anonymous call, reporting a naked child two years of age, unsupervised in a driveway, did not, standing alone, constitute a report of abuse, neglect, or dependency, so the statutory investigative
                        mandate was not properly invoked against the parents of the child that refused to let a caseworker privately interview the child or the child's siblings; one of the initial responsibilities of any department of social services
                        was to screen a report for an ultimate determination of whether to investigate further, as not all reports constituted abuse, neglect, or dependency. In re Stumbo, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 279</cite>,

                        Former G.S. 7A-543 (see now this section) makes no exceptions for extenuating circumstances in reporting suspected child abuse. White v.

                        The report referred to in former G.S. 7A-550 was clearly an initial report of child abuse, as specified in former G.S. 7A-544 (see now this section), which is to be made to the Director of the Department of Social Services. Coleman v. Cooper,

                        Statutory Good Faith Presumption Shields Reporter from Slander Per Se Action. - Summary judgment for the defendant on the issue of slander per se was appropriate where the plaintiff's description of retaliatory motives for defendant's report failed to
                        rebut the statutory presumption created in favor of the defendant by the child abuse reporting provisions of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba03s7B-309" target="_self">G.S. 7B-309</a></cite>                        which together provide immunity not merely conditional upon proof of good faith, but a "good faith" immunity which endows the reporter with the mandatory presumption that he or she acted in good faith.

                        Public Duty Doctrine Inapplicable. - A school resource officer, who allegedly knew that a teacher was facilitating sexual liaisons between a 14-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy, was not required, nor was he permitted, to weigh the safety interests
                        of the public when he decided not to report the boy's possible statutory rape of the girl or the teacher's sexual exploitation of the girl and boy - rather, his duty to report abuse was imposed by statute and involved no deliberation
                        or discretionary consideration; thus, his failure to report known child abuse was outside the scope of conduct generally associated with law enforcement and the public duty doctrine did not bar the claim. Smith v. Jackson County

                        inappropriate contact with students was barred by the public duty doctrine because the investigator did not have a duty under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba03s7B-301" target="_self">G.S. 7B-301</a></cite> to report abuse by a teacher and the special relationship exception did not apply given that the investigator was not present in the middle school

                        the court makes of the director, finds probable cause to believe both that the juvenile is at risk of immediate harm and that the respondent is obstructing or interfering with the director's ability to assess the juvenile's condition,

                        When Right to Counsel Attaches. - The trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in a prosecution for first-degree statutory sexual offense and two counts of felonious child abuse by suppressing defendant's incriminating statement to officers as being
                        taken in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The filing of a petition alleging abuse and neglect commences a civil proceeding, and by its terms, the Sixth Amendment applies only to criminal cases.
                        The Supreme Court could not say, as did the Court of Appeals, that the civil and criminal proceedings were so intertwined that the commencement of the civil proceeding triggered the protection involved in a criminal case. State

                        Social Worker's Role Changed to Agent of State. - In a case involving crimes against child victim where a social worker went beyond merely fulfilling her role as the victim's social worker and began working with the sheriff's department on the case prior
                        to interviewing defendant, the social worker's role changed and became essentially like that of an agent of the State; accordingly, because the social worker did not advise defendant of her Miranda rights, the trial court erred
                        in denying defendant's motion to suppress statements made during her interview with the social worker. State v. Morrell, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 424 S.E.2d 147, appeal dismissed,

                    <p>
                        Intent of Section. - Former G.S. 7A-550 (see now this section) was intended to encourage citizens to report suspected instances of child abuse to the Director of the Department of Social Services without fear of potential liability if the report was made
                        in good faith. It has no application to employees of DSS in the performance of their official duties. Coleman v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 188, 366 S.E.2d 2, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 834</cite>,

                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scope of Immunity. - When suspected child abuse occurs in a public school classroom, a report made in good faith by the principal of the school to his or her superior who is responsible for school personnel would clearly fall within the scope of the immunity
                        contemplated by the statute. Davis v. Durham City Schools, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 372 S.E.2d 318 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Statutory Good Faith Presumption Shields Reporter from Slander Per Se Action. - Summary judgment for the defendant on the issue of slander per se was appropriate where the plaintiff's description of retaliatory motives for defendant's report failed to
                        rebut the statutory presumption created in favor of the defendant by the child abuse reporting provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba03s7B-301" target="_self">G.S. 7B-301</a></cite> and this section
                        which together provide immunity not merely conditional upon proof of good faith, but a "good faith" immunity which endows the reporter with the mandatory presumption that he or she acted in good faith. Dobson v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 77</cite>,
                        530 S.E.2d 829 (2000).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The report referred to in this section is clearly an initial report of child abuse, as specified in former G.S. 7A-543 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba03s7B-301" target="_self">G.S. 7B-301</a></cite>), which is to be
                        made to the Director of the Department of Social Services. Coleman v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 188, 366 S.E.2d 2, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 834</cite>, 371 S.E.2d 275 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Malicious Actions. - Where plaintiff alleged that defendant made false accusations of child abuse and neglect and injury and forecast evidence that the defendant knew the report to be false, a genuine issue of material fact existed - particularly as to
                        whether the defendant acted with malice and therefore lost the immunity accorded by former 7A-550 - to withstand summary judgment in a slander per se cause of action. Dobson v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite>                        573, 521 S.E.2d 710 (1999), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 187</cite>, 541 S.E.2d 728 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Trial court correctly held that the wife's statements to the social services department that the husband molested her two sons were made with actual malice, and therefore negated any defense of privilege under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba03s7B-309" target="_self">G.S. 7B-309</a></cite>.

                        that privilege did not operate to bar relevant evidence in an action that concerned the abuse or neglect of a child. In re K.D., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 631 S.E.2d 150 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Public Duty Doctrine Inapplicable. - A school resource officer, who allegedly knew that a teacher was facilitating sexual liaisons between a 14-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy, was not required, nor was he permitted, to weigh the safety interests
                        of the public when he decided not to report the boy's possible statutory rape of the girl or the teacher's sexual exploitation of the girl and boy - rather, his duty to report abuse was imposed by statute and involved no deliberation
                        or discretionary consideration; thus, his failure to report known child abuse was outside the scope of conduct generally associated with law enforcement and the public duty doctrine did not bar the claim. Smith v. Jackson County
                        Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 452, 608 S.E.2d 399 (2005).

                        Evidence That Defendant in Sexual Abuse Case Had Sexually Transmittable Disease. - Unequivocal evidence that a seven-year-old girl had been sexually abused would invoke former G.S. 7A-551 (see now this section) and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008.html#t08a07s8-53.1" target="_blank">G.S. 8-53.1</a></cite>.
                        Therefore, medical records maintained by a county health department, revealing that defendant had been treated for gonorrhea, were admissible as evidence with regard to the cause or source of the child's disease. State v. Efird,

                        Constitutionality. - Statutory procedures under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba03s7B-300" target="_self">G.S. 7B-300</a></cite> to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba03s7B-311" target="_self">G.S. 7B-311</a></cite> for placing
                        an individual's name on the Responsible Individuals List of those determined to have committed child abuse or neglect violated an accused individual's procedural due process rights under N.C. Const. art. I,
                        <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 19, by not providing a meaningful opportunity to be heard before being placed on the Responsible Individuals List. The court determined that a pre-deprivation hearing was necessary before placement on the Responsible
                        Individuals List, at which the accusations of abuse or neglect must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. In re W.B.M., <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 690 S.E.2d 41 (2010).

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction. - Trial court had jurisdiction to hear a stepmother's petition for judicial review of the order finding that she was a responsible individual and placing her name on the Responsible Individuals List (RIL) because the child was 17 years old
                        at the time the stepmother struck him, and thus, her name was properly added to the RIL; the child's medical records contained numerous instances where his birthday was shown, and the stepmother did not argue that the birthdate
                        was incorrect. In re Patron, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 792 S.E.2d 853 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Placement of Name on Responsible Individuals List Proper. - Trial court did not err in placing a stepmother's name on the Responsible Individuals List (RIL) because the child's testimony tended to establish that when the stepmother struck him in the head
                        it was intentional; because the name of an individual identified as a responsible individual had to be placed on the RIL after it was determined the individual was a responsible individual, the statute required the trial court
                        to conclude that the stepmother's name had to be placed on the RIL. In re Patron, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 792 S.E.2d 853 (2016).

                        at the time the stepmother struck him, and thus, her name was properly added to the RIL; the child's medical records contained numerous instances where his birthday was shown, and the stepmother did not argue that the birthdate

                        shall be by a petition for judicial review filed with the appropriate clerk of court's office with a copy delivered in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the director who determined the abuse or serious neglect
                        and identified the individual as a responsible individual. The petition for judicial review shall contain the name, date of birth, and address of the individual seeking judicial review, the name of the juvenile who was the subject
                        of the determination of abuse or serious neglect, and facts that invoke the jurisdiction of the court. Failure to timely file a petition for judicial review constitutes a waiver of the individual's right to a district court hearing

                        and neglectful parents to avoid court intervention by simply moving from county to county. In re E.C., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 621 S.E.2d 647 (2005).

                        Jurisdiction. - The issuance and service of process is the means by which the court obtains jurisdiction; thus, where no summons was issued, the court acquired jurisdiction over neither the persons nor the subject matter of the action, and was without
                        authority to enter order adjudging a juvenile as neglected. In re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 485 S.E.2d 623 (1997).

                        When a trial court did not completely fill out form orders granting an agency temporary nonsecure custody of a mother's children, by failing to specify the statutory grounds for nonsecure custody in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-503" target="_self">G.S. 7B-503</a></cite>,
                        the court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction to subsequently enter orders terminating the mother's parental rights to the children because (1) the court generally had jurisdiction over this type of case, under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba02s7B-200ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-200(a)(4)</a></cite> and 7B-201(a), (2) the court acquired jurisdiction over the children and the mother when an agency filed petitions under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-401" target="_self">G.S. 7B-401</a></cite>                        alleging the children were neglected and dependent juveniles, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(9)</a></cite> and (15), pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-405" target="_self">G.S. 7B-405</a></cite>,
                        and (3) the failure to fully complete the form orders did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction, as it was not alleged that the court did not observe the criteria for such orders in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-504" target="_self">G.S. 7B-504</a></cite>                        and 7B-506(a).

                        Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction after periodic judicial reviews were discontinued to adjudicate juveniles as abused, neglected, or dependent when a director of social services (DSS) sought court action based on a new report of abuse, neglect,
                        or dependency without the prior filing of a verified petition by the DSS. Moreover, the trial court could not proceed directly to a dispositional hearing without first conducting an adjudicatory hearing and actually adjudicating
                        the juveniles as abused, neglected, or dependent. In re T.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 803 S.E.2d 1 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Because the language of subsection (a) identifies "a county director of social services" as the proper petitioner in a juvenile adjudication action rather than "the director" or similar language singling out particular directors, the legislature did not
                        intend to limit the class of parties who may invoke the court's subject matter jurisdiction in juvenile adjudication actions to only directors of county departments of social services in the county where the juvenile at issue resides
                        or is found. In re A.P., <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 14</cite>, 812 S.E.2d 840 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Standing. - County department of social services had standing to file a juvenile petition alleging that a child was a neglected and dependent juvenile because the petition was properly verified and filed by an authorized representative of "a county director
                        of social services"; the statutory sections governing "parties" and "venue" did not mandate dismissal of the juvenile petition. In re A.P., <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 14</cite>, 812 S.E.2d 840 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        General Assembly's use of the indefinite article, "a" before "county director of social services" belies the notion that the provision limits standing to any one county director of social services. In re A.P., <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 14</cite>,
                        812 S.E.2d 840 (2018).

        Testimony Properly Considered.
       </b> - Because the trial court was statutorily required to hear testimony from the foster parents and any person who would aid in its review, its decision to permit the foster parents and their counsel to participate in
                        the permanency planning proceedings was not manifestly unsupported by reason; the trial court did not allow the foster parents to intervene as parties but permitted their counsel to facilitate their testimony on direct examination,
                        which was information it was required to hear. In re J.L., - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 258 (2019).

                        Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the juvenile petition filed by the caseworker even though the caseworker did not sign it and, thus, the trial court could enter its termination of parental rights order regarding the father; while the caseworker
                        did not specifically state in the petition that the caseworker was an authorized representative of the director of the Department of Social Services, the caseworker's verification of the petition was sufficient for the trial court
                        to exercise jurisdiction over the case. In re D.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 654 S.E.2d 1 (2007).

                        for distinguishing between a juvenile petition and a Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction petition when it comes to the verification requirement; because of the mandatory nature of the remedy under
                        the Hague Convention, which entails removing a child from a parent and returning the child to another country, the interests at stake have the same magnitude and the potential consequences of any error would be just as devastating
                        as with a juvenile petition, and the failure to verify a petition filed pursuant to the Hague Convention deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over that petition.

                        Juvenile petition contained a verification that appeared facially valid, as it was signed by an authorized representative of the director of the human services department, but the signature was illegible, and the space reserved for that person's title
                        was blank; respondent had the burden of showing that the petition was not verified before a person authorized to administer oaths, and considering the presumption of regularity that attached to the trial court's decision to exercise
                        jurisdiction, the appellate court had no basis to conclude that the petition was not properly verified. In re N.T., <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 705</cite>, 782 S.E.2d 502 (2016).

                        was effective to grant jurisdiction to the trial court. In re N.X.A., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 803 S.E.2d 244 (2017), review denied, 807 S.E.2d 148, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 957 (N.C. 2017).

                        Jurisdiction. - The issuance and service of process is the means by which the court obtains jurisdiction; thus, where no summons was issued, the court acquired jurisdiction over neither the persons nor the subject matter of the action, and was without
                        authority to enter order adjudging a juvenile as neglected. In re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 485 S.E.2d 623 (1997).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Juvenile petition was filed June 11, 2004, and the summons was issued four days later, but the summons was returned by the sheriff on June 30, 2004, unserved; on July 8, 2004, the mother attended a hearing regarding the allegations her minor child was
                        neglected and dependent. The mother was not only present in court, but also agreed to continue the matter until July 22, 2004, and there was no evidence that the mother raised any objection at that hearing regarding insufficient
                        service of process or personal jurisdiction; thus, her actions amounted to waiver of her right to challenge the trial court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over her regardless of whether she was served with a juvenile summons
                        in compliance with G.S. 1A-1-4. In re A.J.M., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 745, 630 S.E.2d 33 (2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Failure to serve the children with a petition alleging abuse and neglect could not be basis for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because only a parent, guardian, or caretaker was required to be served. In re M.G., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite>                        536, 653 S.E.2d 581 (2007), aff'd in part and rev'd in part <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 958 (N.C. Ct. App. 2010).

                    <p>
                        Although a summons in a juvenile neglect proceeding was not properly signed pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-406" target="_self">G.S. 7B-406</a></cite> and 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(b), only personal jurisdiction,
                        rather than subject matter jurisdiction, was implicated, and where the parents appeared in the neglect proceeding and they failed to object thereto, such defense was waived; a termination of parental rights in reliance on the neglect
                        order was valid. In re K.J.L., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 343</cite>, 677 S.E.2d 835 (June 18, 2009).

                        Trial Court Is Without Jurisdiction Where No Notice Was Served. - A trial court did not have jurisdiction to enter orders in a juvenile delinquency proceeding where no summons, petition or other notice was ever served on the juvenile or her parents, guardian
                        or custodian prior to any of the hearings. In re McAllister, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 614, 188 S.E.2d 723 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Statement on return that service was accomplished implies that it was done in the manner required by law. In re Leggett, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 745, 314 S.E.2d 144 (1984).

                    <p>
                        It is the service of summons, rather than the return of the officer, that confers jurisdiction. In re Leggett, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 745, 314 S.E.2d 144 (1984); In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite>                        550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Failure of Record to Show Time and Manner of Service. - Failure of a record of a juvenile delinquency proceeding to show the exact time and manner of service of the summons and petition upon the juvenile and his parents was not fatal where the record
                        affirmatively showed that the juvenile and his mother were in fact accorded sufficient notice of the hearing at which he was adjudicated delinquent to provide adequate opportunity to prepare, that at least seven days prior to the
                        hearing he had been represented by privately employed counsel, and that he was represented by such counsel at the hearing, which had already been once continued. In re Collins, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite>                        142, 182 S.E.2d 662 (1971).

                        Service by Publication. - Notice to the father by publication of a neglect proceeding against his daughter was proper since the agency's affidavit stated that the father could not be found by a diligent effort because he was a transient person with no
                        permanent residence. In re Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite> 126, 566 S.E.2d 744 (2002).

                        showed that his father was served with notice, and it was found as a fact that the mother's address was unknown and no evidence to dispute the finding was in the record.

                        in the non-secure custody of the county Department of Social Services (DSS); assuming, without deciding, that a magistrate lacked authority to enter a nonsecure custody order, the mother cited no authority suggesting that such

                        Jurisdiction Required. - Subdivision (d) of this section requires that the trial court have jurisdiction before exercising the powers granted thereunder. In re Transp. of Juveniles, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 806,
                        403 S.E.2d 557 (1991).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court had authority pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba02s7B-200ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-200(a)(6)</a></cite> to issue an ex parte order directing a mother to cease interference with a department's juvenile
                        investigation concerning her children; however, where no request for nonsecure custody was presented and no petition alleging that the children were neglected was filed, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award custody of the
                        children to their father. In re K.C.G., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 615 S.E.2d 76 (2005).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Standard of Proof for Termination and Removal Distinguished. - There is a substantive difference between the quantum of adequate proof of neglect and dependency for purposes of termination and for purposes of removal. The most significant difference is
                        that while parental rights may not be terminated for threatened future harm, the Department of Social Services may obtain temporary custody of a child when there is a risk of neglect in the future. In re Evans,
                        <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 344 S.E.2d 325 (1986).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The task at the temporary custody or removal stage is to determine whether the child is exposed to a substantial risk of physical injury because the parent is unable to provide adequate protection. In re Evans, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                        449, 344 S.E.2d 325 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Findings of Fact Required. - Trial court erred in concluding that child was dependent there were no findings of fact concerning the mother's ability to provide care or supervision for the child or that the mother lacked an alternative child care arrangement
                        to support the court's conclusion that the child was dependent. In re E.C., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 621 S.E.2d 647 (2005).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Court erred in ordering an infant placed in guardianship because homelessness and joblessness did not per se support an abuse or neglect finding; but the court committed no error in admitting social services and guardian ad litem reports or alleged hearsay
                        where the objection to the hearsay was unpreserved. In re Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 576 S.E.2d 386 (2003).
                    </p>

                        When a trial court did not completely fill out form orders granting an agency temporary nonsecure custody of a mother's children, by failing to specify the statutory grounds for nonsecure custody in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-503" target="_self">G.S. 7B-503</a></cite>,
                        the court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction to subsequently enter orders terminating the mother's parental rights to the children because (1) the court generally had jurisdiction over this type of case, under

                    The custody order shall be in writing and shall direct a law enforcement officer or other authorized person to take physical custody of the juvenile and to make due return on the order. A copy of the order shall be given to the juvenile's parent, guardian,

                <p>
                    An officer receiving an order for custody which is complete and regular on its face may execute it in accordance with its terms. If the court finds on the basis of the petition and request for nonsecure custody or the testimony of the petitioner that
                    a less intrusive remedy is not available, the court may authorize a law enforcement officer to enter private property to take physical custody of the juvenile. If required by exigent circumstances of the case, the court may authorize
                    a law enforcement officer to make a forcible entry at any hour. The officer is not required to inquire into the regularity or continued validity of the order and shall not incur criminal or civil liability for its due service.

                        The trial court had jurisdiction to enter a temporary nonsecure custody order placing children who had been visiting noncustodial parent in North Carolina, but whose "home state" under the former UCCJA was Iowa, with DSS where there was a reasonable factual
                        basis to believe that one child had been sexually abused and hospitalized for depression and the other child had been physically abused and was hospitalized for stress disorder, pending application to home state to determine if
                        Iowa was willing to exercise jurisdiction. In re Van Kooten, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 764, 487 S.E.2d 160 (1997), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 576</cite>, 502 S.E.2d

                                §§ 1901, et seq., as amended, and the Howard M. Metzenbaum Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-382, 108 Stat. 4056, as amended, as they may apply. Placement of a juvenile with a relative outside of this State
                                must be in accordance with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children set forth in Article 38 of this Chapter.

                                If the court does not place the juvenile with a relative, the court may consider whether nonrelative kin or other persons with legal custody of a sibling of the juvenile is willing and able to provide proper care and supervision of the juvenile in a safe
                                home. The court may order the department to notify the juvenile's State-recognized tribe of the need for nonsecure custody for the purpose of locating relatives or nonrelative kin for placement. The court may order placement
                                of the juvenile with nonrelative kin or other persons with legal custody of a sibling of the juvenile if the court finds the placement is in the juvenile's best interests.

                        The determination of "reasonable efforts" under former G.S. 7A-577(h) is a conclusion of law because it requires the exercise of judgment; appellate review of a trial court's conclusions of law is limited to whether they are supported by findings of fact.
                        In re Helms, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 491 S.E.2d 672 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Court's Jurisdiction. - County department of social services (DSS) had no right to appeal the trial court's denial of the court's motion to review the foster care board rate provisions of a nonsecure custody order under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1001ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1001(a)(1)</a></cite>,
                        which permitted appeal from any order finding absence of jurisdiction, as the trial court never ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction to decide DSS's motion. Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-506ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7B-506(d)</a></cite>,
                        7B-200(a), the trial court clearly had jurisdiction to enter a nonsecure custody order; and, assuming arguendo that the court erred in the scope of the court's order for board payments to foster parents, this did not necessarily
                        deprive the court of jurisdiction. In re A.T., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 662 S.E.2d 917 (2008).

                        When a trial court did not completely fill out form orders granting an agency temporary nonsecure custody of a mother's children, by failing to specify the statutory grounds for nonsecure custody in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-503" target="_self">G.S. 7B-503</a></cite>,
                        the court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction to subsequently enter orders terminating the mother's parental rights to the children because (1) the court generally had jurisdiction over this type of case, under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba02s7B-200ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-200(a)(4)</a></cite> and 7B-201(a), (2) the court acquired jurisdiction over the children and the mother when an agency filed petitions under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-401" target="_self">G.S. 7B-401</a></cite>                        alleging the children were neglected and dependent juveniles, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(9)</a></cite> and (15), pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-405" target="_self">G.S. 7B-405</a></cite>,
                        and (3) the failure to fully complete the form orders did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction, as it was not alleged that the court did not observe the criteria for such orders in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-504" target="_self">G.S. 7B-504</a></cite>                        and 7B-506(a).

        Court's Taking Notice of Orders.
       </b> - Notwithstanding the trial court's authority to take notice of the court's own orders, it was problematic to allow the trial court's findings in the first order on nonsecure custody to serve as the sole support for
                        most findings in the neglect adjudication; the trial court was not bound by the rules of evidence at the custody hearing and respondents had no right to appeal, and to allow the trial court to find adjudicatory facts by taking
                        judicial notice of the court's prior findings undermined the procedural safeguards for adjudications. In re J.C.M.J.C., - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 670 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Reasonable Efforts Shown. - The DSS made reasonable efforts to prevent child's removal from her home where the DSS entered into four different protection plans with the mother regarding the care and protection of the child in an effort by DSS to stabilize
                        the child's home environment and protect her from violent individuals and drugs, and to encourage the mother to apply for food stamps, AFDC, and Medicaid. In re Helms, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite>                        505, 491 S.E.2d 672 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Agency Had Standing Under Nonsecure Custody Order. - DSS had standing to file a termination of parental rights petition as it had been granted indefinite custody of a child under a nonsecure custody order issued under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-506ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-506(a)</a></cite>,
                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a3" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)(3)</a></cite> did not limit standing to parties granted custody by an order entered pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-905" target="_self">G.S. 7B-905</a></cite>,
                        but required only that DSS be granted custody by a court of competent jurisdiction. In re T.M., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 643 S.E.2d 471 (2007).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hearing on five petitions alleging abuse, neglect, and/or dependency was clearly denominated a hearing to determine the need for continued custody. The judge therefore had the discretion to either continue nonsecure custody or to return the children to
                        their home; he did not have the authority to dismiss the petitions because in so doing he made an unauthorized determination of the merits of the case. There is no express statutory authority allowing the judge to dismiss the petitions
                        at a five-day hearing. In re Guarante, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. App.</cite> 598, 427 S.E.2d 883 (1993).

                    <p>
                        Placement With Relatives. - When, in a dependency proceeding, a trial court placed a child's custody with the child's foster parents without finding it was contrary to the child's best interests to place her with willing relatives, pursuant to
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-903ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-903(a)(2)</a></cite>c, this was error because, inter alia, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-505" target="_self">G.S. 7B-505</a></cite> required the trial
                        court, in entering a nonsecure custody order, to first consider the child's placement with a relative; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-506ol1h" target="_self">G.S. 7B-506(h)</a></cite> continued this requirement at each
                        hearing to determine the need for the child's continued custody outside of her home, so the general assembly intended to apply this requirement to reviews of custody placements. In re L.L., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite>                        689, 616 S.E.2d 392 (2005).

                    <p>
                        No Prejudice from Delay of Hearing for Continued Nonsecure Custody. - Mother's claim that a trial court violated <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-506ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-506(a)</a></cite> by failing to hold a hearing
                        for continued nonsecure custody within seven calendar days after entry of a nonsecure custody order was overruled because although the initial nonsecure custody order was entered on 18 June 2007 and was set to expire on 25 June
                        2007, and the trial court did not conduct a hearing on the need for continued nonsecure custody until 27 June 2007, the mother did not make any argument as to how she was prejudiced by the two-day delay.

                    <p>
                        Applicability. - When a trial court granted children's custody to their grandparents and released department of social services from further responsibility, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(a)</a></cite>,
                        which requires findings as to the agency's obligation of reasonable efforts to eliminate the need for the children's placement in the agency's custody, did not apply. In re Padgett, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 644,
                        577 S.E.2d 337 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Award of guardianship did not cease social services department's duty to continue reunification efforts with the mother because the dispositional order did not make a guardianship the permanent plan. Therefore, the trial court was not required to make
                        findings pursuant to G. S. 7B-507(b). In re E.C., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 621 S.E.2d 647 (2005).

                        not warranted because ICWA did not require reunification efforts to persist if such efforts were clearly inconsistent with a juvenile's health, safety, and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable period of time, since
                        ICWA shared the primary aim of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, 42 U.S.C.S.

                        <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 1912(d) did not prohibit ceasing reunification efforts before a proceeding to terminate parental rights, as the subsection only required a finding that "active efforts" to prevent the disruption of the Indian family
                        "proved unsuccessful." In re E.G.M., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 196, 750 S.E.2d 857 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Notice Requirements. - Trial court erred in authorizing a permanent plan for a child at the disposition hearing on a dependency petition, seemingly without the required statutory notice to respondent. On remand, the trial court was required to provide
                        the statutory notice. In the Matter of S.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 718 S.E.2d 709 (2011).

                        Parents waived their right to notice of the trial court's intent to enter a permanent plan since they did not object to the entry of a permanent plan at disposition. In re J.P., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 742

                    <p>
                        Reunification Efforts Not Warranted Due to Threat of Harm to Child. - Trial court repeatedly found that the immediate threat of harm to a child outweighed the reasonable efforts to reunify him with respondent mother. Due to the severe abuse by the mother
                        and the mother's reaction to the boyfriend's abuse, the trial court determined it was not in the best interests of the child to order reasonable efforts to reunify the child with respondent, as it was too dangerous to do so, and
                        the trial court properly complied with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507</a></cite>. In re R.B.B., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 639, 654 S.E.2d 514 (2007),
                        review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 235</cite>, 659 S.E.2d 738 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Reunification Efforts Not Warranted at Permanency Planning Hearing. - Given its findings, the trial court, at the permanency planning hearing, had no obligation to further attempt to reunify mother and child and, indeed, had the obligation to locate permanent
                        placement for the child outside of her home. In re Dula, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 544 S.E.2d 591 (2001), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 356</cite>, 554 S.E.2d 336 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Appointment of Permanent Legal Guardians in Disposition Order Held Improper. - Trial court erred in appointing permanent legal guardians in its disposition order where the mother did not have statutorily required notice that a permanent plan was being
                        considered and the trial court did not make the findings mandated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)</a></cite>, (c), and (f) (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>).
                        In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 644 S.E.2d 640 (2007).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Disposition Order Affirmed. - Trial court made uncontested findings, in part, that the return of the children to the parents' home would be contrary to the children's welfare and best interest because issues still existed and the children required more
                        adequate care than parents could currently provide, and reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for the children's placement, and the trial court's disposition order was affirmed. In re A.L.T.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 774 S.E.2d 316 (2015).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Findings Required. - In proceedings to terminate parental rights, a trial court's permanency planning order, which implicitly ceased reunification efforts between a mother and her children, did not comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)</a></cite>                        because, while the order detailed the mother's case history and her failure to complete her case plan, the order did not contain any of the findings of fact regarding the continuation or cessation of reunification efforts as required
                        by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)(1)</a></cite>. In re A.P.W., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 534, 741 S.E.2d 388 (2013), review denied, 747 S.E.2d 251, 2013 N.C. LEXIS
                        759 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although a permanency planning order did not satisfy the statutory requirements, considering the order in conjunction with the termination of parental rights order satisfied the requirements because the two orders together embraced the substance of the
                        statutory provisions requiring findings of fact that further reunification efforts would have been futile or would have been inconsistent with a juvenile's health, safety, and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable
                        period of time. In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 763 S.E.2d 314 (2014).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Insufficient Evidence to Terminate Reunification Efforts. - Order terminating efforts to reunite mother and two year old daughter and directing termination of mother's parental rights was reversed as overwhelming evidence was that mother was cooperating
                        with the reunification plan and was making progress and only the guardian ad litem recommended reunification efforts cease. In re Eckard, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 187, 547 S.E.2d 835 (2001).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's order which changed a mother's permanency planning order from reunification efforts with her two minor children to termination of her parental rights was based on findings of fact which were deemed insufficient to support the conclusions
                        of law, and accordingly, there was no compliance with the requirement of subsection (b) of this section, and the order was reversed; the trial court failed to make specific factual findings that efforts towards reunification with
                        the mother would be futile or that such efforts were inconsistent with the children's health, safety, and need for a permanent home, and the findings listed were actually conclusions of law. In re Weiler,
                        <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 581 S.E.2d 134 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in entering a permanency order relieving an agency from reunification efforts between a father and his children; the court failed to make required findings of fact pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>), and the evidence did not show
                        that reunification was futile. In re Everett, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 588 S.E.2d 579 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights because it failed to make sufficient findings of fact, and did not ultimately find, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)(1)</a></cite>,
                        that attempted reunification efforts would be futile, or reunification would be inconsistent with the juvenile's health, safety, and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable time; since the trial court made findings
                        of fact addressing the reunification efforts already made by the county department of social services and the mother's demonstrated failure to complete her case plan, but it did not link any of those findings to the two prongs
                        set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)(1)</a></cite>. In re I.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 714 S.E.2d 495 (2011).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred when it ceased reunification efforts and awarded guardianship of a child to the child's foster parents because the evidence and the findings failed to support the trial court's conclusion that reunification efforts with one of the child's
                        parents would have been futile or would have been inconsistent with the child's health, safety, and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable period of time. In re I.K., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite>                        264, 742 S.E.2d 588 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court had an obligation to determine that efforts to reunite the child with the father would be futile before it could direct reunification efforts to cease. In re A.E.C., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 768
                        S.E.2d 166 (2015).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence Sufficient to Terminate Reunification Efforts. - Despite an appellate court's determination that several of the trial court's findings of fact were not supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in a neglect and abuse case, it also found
                        that several findings of fact were so supported and provided sufficient evidence to uphold the neglect and abuse adjudication of a mother's infant child based on the mother's (1) whereabouts to have been unknown upon the baby's
                        discharge from the hospital, (2) testing positive for marijuana since the adjudication hearing, (3) refusal to attend several substance abuse assessments, (4) failure to make progress on her psychological problems, and (5) abuse

                        In a case involving <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(a)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(c)</a></cite> (repealed, see now

                        the children were paramount, and the trial court had no assurances the mother had made sufficient progress for the children to be returned to the mother's care. In re T.K., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 35, 613 S.E.2d

                        Trial court's findings supported its conclusion that the children were dependent under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(9)</a></cite> because it found that the mother could not care for her
                        children without constant assistance, and that such assistance was not available to her. In re J.J., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 637 S.E.2d 258 (2006), aff'd, cert. dismissed, in part, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 172</cite>,

                        Trial court did not err in failing to order the local social services department to assist the mother in her reunification efforts where the evidence supported the trial court's findings that continued reunification efforts were unlikely to succeed and
                        were not in the children's best interests. In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 644 S.E.2d 640 (2007).

                        Termination of a mother's visitation with a child was not an abuse of discretion under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-901" target="_self">G.S. 7B-901</a></cite>,

                        parenting of a sibling and their lack of progress in working with a department of social services to parent the child. In re C.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 644 S.E.2d 588 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's 17 findings supported its conclusion that further reunification efforts with the parents would be futile for purposes of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)(1)</a></cite>                        and (3), including that: (1) the parents were mildly mentally retarded; (2) the mother shared characteristics with parents known to abuse their children; (3) the mother failed to comply with a sibling's case plan; (4) the department
                        of social services had offered the parents intensive case management services after the child's birth; and (5) there was a concern about the father's ability to be a primary caretaker.

                    <p>
                        Decision to cease reunification efforts and visitation was not manifestly unsupported because there was clear and convincing evidence supporting the trial court's dispositional finding that the parents failed to cooperate with various social workers when
                        their first child was placed in protective custody, failed to fully comply with family service plans relating to the removal of their first child, did not make reasonable efforts at reunification with their first child, and did
                        not recognize appropriate responsibility or involvement in the injuries of their first child. In re N.G., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 650 S.E.2d 45 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 229</cite>,

                        Reunification efforts were not required under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)(1)</a></cite> when a juvenile who was in foster care and who had experienced domestic abuse displayed
                        bizarre behaviors after visiting with the juvenile's parent, because reunification was inconsistent with the child's health, safety, and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable period of time; furthermore, the juvenile's
                        bizarre behaviors coincided with the visits, and after the visits were ceased, the juvenile made significant changes for the better. In re T.R.M., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 702 S.E.2d 108 (2010).

                        In a parental rights termination proceeding, a trial court, through processes of logical reasoning and based on the evidentiary facts before it, found the ultimate facts essential to support the conclusions of law that directed that reunification efforts
                        cease; the necessary findings for such cessation were sufficiently made pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)(1)</a></cite>. In the Matter of T.J.C.,

                        There was no abuse of discretion in a trial court's order that provided for cessation of reunification efforts between parents and their minor children pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)(1)</a></cite>,
                        as there were extensive findings regarding the father's history of domestic violence, the impact of that violence on the minor children, and the father's lack of appreciation of the effect of such violence, even after attending

                        Trial court's decision to cease reunification efforts and award guardianship of a child to the paternal grandparents was not done in error under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)(1)</a></cite>                        because the court's findings established that verbal aggression and significant conflict between the parents was continuing, including two significant episodes only three months before the hearing, and the parents had not successfully
                        engaged in couples therapy. The conflict and domestic violence continued to have a detrimental effect on the child's physical and emotional well-being. In re A.Y., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 737 S.E.2d 160 (2013),

                    <p>
                        Trial court's decision to cease reunification efforts with respect to a mother's children was supported by its findings, which were not challenged on appeal, that reunification was not in their best interest since their parents had not addressed the issue
                        of child abuse. In re J.P., - N.C. App. - , 745 S.E.2d 917 (Aug. 6, 2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court properly found further efforts to reunify a mother's children with the mother were unwarranted because uncontested findings of fact supported the court's conclusions that reunification efforts were inconsistent with the children's health,
                        safety and need for a permanent home within a reasonable period of time and were not required. In re T.H., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 5, 2013).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's finding that a mother and her husband were not addressing the husband's abuse of one child by remaining together although there was a no-contact order between the husband and child were linked to and supported the trial court's conclusion
                        that reunification efforts should cease as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)</a></cite>. In re J.P., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 523,

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in entering an order ceasing reunification because the findings in the cease reunification order standing alone suggested that reunification efforts would be futile; the order found unchallenged that the mother failed to attend
                        visits or complete her case plan, had pending criminal charges, and had not been participating in drug screens, and as such, the children would be unable to go home within six months.

                    <p>
                        Findings Sufficient to Terminate Reunification Efforts. - Trial court properly related its findings that child two could not be placed with her mother since she resided with the father and he had a no contact order with child two, that the father had
                        pled guilty to child abuse and had violated his probation and that a permanent plan of custody was in the children's best interests to a conclusion of law that specifically set forth the basis for ceasing reunification efforts.

                    <p>
                        Trial court's order embraced the substance of the statutory provisions requiring findings of fact that further reunification efforts would be futile or inconsistent with the juvenile's health, safety, and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable
                        period of time. In re L.M.T., <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 165</cite>, 752 S.E.2d 453 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in ordering that reunification efforts with the mother cease because they were inconsistent with the child's health, safety and need for a safe, permanent home as the mother had not shown sustained parenting improvements during
                        the last two years; she had sporadic visitation attendance during the last two years; a social worker testified that the mother had been unable to consistently demonstrate skills learned in parenting classes during her interactions
                        with the child; the mother lacked awareness of or insight into her own past of domestic violence with the child's father; despite working on anger management issues for over a year, she could not control her emotions; and she had
                        failed to maintain stable housing. In re P.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 794 S.E.2d 843 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Findings Insufficient to Terminate Reunification Efforts. - Insufficient findings supported a trial court's conclusion that reasonable efforts to reunify a father and a child were not required because (1) limited facts cited did not show further efforts
                        would be futile or inconsistent with the child's need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable period of time, and (2) the findings mostly addressed the child's mother.

                        Functional Equivalent of Reasonable Efforts Shown. - Trial court complied with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1a3" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(a)(3)</a></cite> when it ordered the Department of Social Services to supervise
                        the mother's visitation and to aid the mother in a substance abuse assessment and psychological evaluation, the functional equivalent of making reasonable efforts. In re H.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 480, 677

                        Concurrent Permanent Placement Plan of Reunification and Adoption Held Proper. - Concurrent permanent placement plan of reunification and adoption as allowed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(d)</a></cite>                        did not conflict with the requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(a)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>)
                        to obtain permanent placement within a reasonable period of time; concurrent plans leading to adoption of children by their foster parents and reunification with their mother were proper.

                    <p>
                        Placement with County Social Services Department. - Trial court did not err in placing the minor child in the custody of the county social services department despite the father's contention that the minor child could have been placed with relatives;
                        no showing was made that suitable relatives existed, especially since the father's paternity was at issue, and thus placement with the paternal grandparents as suggested by the father might not be in the best interests of the minor
                        child since the minor child might find that they were not the minor child's relatives after all. In re D.S.A., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 641 S.E.2d 18 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Placement With Non-Relative. - Trial court did not abuse its discretion by placing a mother's children in a non-relative placement because either no suitable relative was available or it was not in the children's best interests to place them with a relative,
                        and reunification efforts would be inconsistent with their health, safety and need for a permanent home within a reasonable period of time. In re T.H., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 753

                    <p>
                        Appeals. - Mother had the right to appeal a permanency planning order because the order, while not explicitly ceasing reunification efforts, implicitly did so by changing the permanent plan to adoption and ordering the filing of a petition to terminate
                        parental rights and the mother properly preserved her right to appeal the cessation of reunification efforts pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(c)</a></cite>.

                        represent the juvenile in legal actions before any court. The guardian may consent to certain actions on the part of the juvenile in place of the parent including (i) marriage, (ii) enlisting in the Armed Forces of the United States,
                        and (iii) enrollment in school. The guardian may also consent to any necessary remedial, psychological, medical, or surgical treatment for the juvenile. The authority of the guardian shall continue until the guardianship is terminated

                        the guardian has neglected a guardian's duties, or (iv) the guardian is unwilling or unable to continue assuming a guardian's duties.

                        Applicability. - Trial court's denial of a mother's request to regain legal and physical custody of her minor child, who was in the legal custody of the county department of social services and under the guardianship of the child's grandparents, was reversed
                        and remanded because while the court held multiple proceedings pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>),
                        there was never a finding made that guardianship was the permanent plan under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>);

        Mother Had Standing to Bring Appeal.
       </b> - Mother had standing to appeal a permanency planning order awarding guardianship of a child to foster parents because the statutory requirements were satisfied since the trial court's permanency planning order changed
                        legal custody of the child from county department of social services to the foster parents, and the mother was the child's parent who was a "nonprevailing party"; the mother asserted her own parental interest in having the child
                        placed in a foster home with is half-siblings. In re J.L., - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 258 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Removal of Guardian. - A legal guardian of a child's person, unlike a mere custodian, is not removable for a mere change of circumstances; unfitness or neglect of duty must be shown. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                        53, 334 S.E.2d 428 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 194</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 584 (1986).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adequate Resources. - Evidence supported the finding that the child's aunt had adequate resources to care for the child; while some evidence indicated that the aunt had financial difficulties over the summer, and her testimony was lacking in specificity,
                        her sworn statement that she was willing to care for the child and possessed the financial resources to do so constituted competent evidence supporting the trial court's ruling. In re N.H., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite>                        501, 804 S.E.2d 841 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Ensure Guardian had Ability to Support Child. - Trial court erred in failing the verify that the guardian, the father's girlfriend, had adequate resources to care appropriately for the child, as required by this section and G.S.7B-906.1(j),
                        as the guardian's assurance that she had the financial and emotional ability to support the child was not sufficient evidence of such ability In re P.A., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 772
                        S.E.2d 240 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not adequately insure that a child's proposed guardians understood the legal significance of guardianship or had the means to support the child because (1) the proposed guardians did not testify, so the court could not independently verify
                        the proposed guardians' understanding, and (2) insufficient evidence of the proposed guardians' ability to support the child was introduced. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780
                        S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Appointment of Guardian Was Proper. - Guardian was properly appointed for child where the dispositional order demonstrated that the trial court found guardianship to be in the child's best interest following the presentation at the adjudicatory hearing

                        hearing, providing the court with additional grounds to appoint a guardian. In re E.C., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 621 S.E.2d 647 (2005).

                        When in a petition a juvenile is alleged to be abused or neglected, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the juvenile. When a juvenile is alleged to be dependent, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the juvenile.
                        The juvenile is a party in all actions under this Subchapter. The guardian ad litem and attorney advocate have standing to represent the juvenile in all actions under this Subchapter where they have been appointed. The appointment
                        shall be made pursuant to the program established by Article 12 of this Chapter unless representation is otherwise provided pursuant to G.S. 7B-1202 or G.S. 7B-1203. The appointment shall terminate when the permanent plan has been
                        achieved for the juvenile and approved by the court. The court may reappoint the guardian ad litem pursuant to a showing of good cause upon motion of any party, including the guardian ad litem, or of the court. In every case where
                        a nonattorney is appointed as a guardian ad litem, an attorney shall be appointed in the case in order to assure protection of the juvenile's legal rights throughout the proceeding. The duties of the guardian ad litem program shall
                        be to make an investigation to determine the facts, the needs of the juvenile, and the available resources within the family and community to meet those needs; to facilitate, when appropriate, the settlement of disputed issues;
                        to offer evidence and examine witnesses at adjudication; to explore options with the court at the dispositional hearing; to conduct follow-up investigations to insure that the orders of the court are being properly executed; to
                        report to the court when the needs of the juvenile are not being met; and to protect and promote the best interests of the juvenile until formally relieved of the responsibility by the court.

                        Appointment Of Guardian Ad Litem Program Staff Member Satisfies Requirements Of The Statute. - Trial court's appointment of a guardian ad litem was valid because the use of a properly appointed Guardian Ad Litem Program staff member to serve as a juvenile's
                        guardian ad litem fully satisfied the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601</a></cite>; when a Guardian Ad Litem Program staff member is formally appointed
                        by the trial court to serve as an individual guardian ad litem and fulfills the duties of a guardian ad litem as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601(a)</a></cite>, that staff member
                        is acting as an actual guardian ad litem under the statute and cannot be considered a substitute or "de facto" guardian. In re A.N.L., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 266, 714 S.E.2d 189 (2011).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the child from the beginning of a termination proceeding; a GAL and an attorney advocate performed distinct and separate roles, so the appointment of the attorney advocate as the GAL
                        after three and a half days of testimony was insufficient, even though the advocate had been involved in the case from an earlier time. In re R.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 614 S.E.2d
                        382 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Because five different guardian ad litems (GAL) made sporadic appearances for a mother's children at different hearings over a three-year period, and the only GAL actually appointed by the court never appeared at any hearing, there was no GAL discharging
                        their duty to protect and promote the best interests of the children until formally relieved of the responsibility by the court as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601(a)</a></cite>.

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for a mother's son because the guardian ad litem prepared a report, which reflected an investigation that complied with her duties as set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601(a)</a></cite>;
                        the report was submitted to the trial court in connection with the initial adjudication hearing, the trial court's adjudication and disposition order asserted that the guardian ad litem appeared at the hearing on the son's behalf,
                        and that she submitted a report to the trial court relating to the son. In re A.S., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 679, 661 S.E.2d 313 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 681</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 740

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in conducting a permanency planning review hearing in the absence of a guardian ad litem appointed to represent a juvenile because the juvenile's mother neither asserted nor argued prejudice as a result of the absence of a guardian
                        ad litem at the permanency planning hearing; according to the plain language of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1108" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1108</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601</a></cite>,
                        the guardian ad litem's appointment did not terminate until the permanent plan had been achieved for the juvenile and approved by the court, and consequently, the guardian ad litem was required to continue to represent the juvenile
                        at the permanency planning review hearing, but, standing alone, the failure to adhere to the requirement during a permanency planning hearing did not warrant reversal and, as such, the matter was subject to harmless error review.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the mother failed to object to the lack of a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the child during the termination proceedings, the issue was not preserved for appellate review; furthermore, the appellate court did not find it necessary to invoke the rule
                        suspending the Rules of Appellate Procedure to prevent manifest injustice to either the mother or the child and to review the decision not to appoint a GAL in light of the mother's willful failure to make progress on her case plan,
                        both before and after reunification efforts were ceased, and because a GAL appointment was not statutorily required. In re P.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 794 S.E.2d 843 (2016).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Clerical Error. - Attorney who was appointed to serve as guardian ad litem (GAL) and attorney advocated investigated the case prior to the termination hearing and reported his observations to the trial court, such that competently fulfilled his role as
                        GAL, and the trial court's clerical oversight in its execution of the proper form regarding its failure to check the GAL designation box for the person whom it properly designated on the same form to serve as attorney advocate
                        was not prejudicial error. In re C.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 42</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 742 (2020).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Guardian's Acceptance of Petition to Terminate Parental Rights Sufficient for Jurisdiction. - Because the captions of the summonses naming the parents as respondents stated the name of the juvenile, and the guardians ad litem for the juvenile certified
                        that they accepted service of the petition on the juvenile's behalf, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the petition for termination of parental rights. In re S.D.J., <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite>                        478, 665 S.E.2d 818 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Guardian's Physical Presence. - As <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1108" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1108</a></cite> mandated the guardian
                        ad litem's (GAL) physical presence at a termination of parental rights hearing, because a GAL was not present the court presumed prejudice, as the children were not represented by a GAL at a critical stage of the termination proceedings.
                        In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 165, 695 S.E.2d 162 (2010).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the presence of the minor children's nonattorney guardian ad litem (GAL) volunteer at a termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing was preferable, the nonlawyer volunteer's attendance was not mandatory because, given the role of the attorney advocate

                        Authority of Guardian ad Litem to Inquire as to Child's Adoption. - It was the duty and right of guardian ad litem to inquire into Department of Social Services' handling of child's adoption, and it was within the district court's jurisdiction to order

                        to visit child and to obtain information on any prospective adoptive parents, and subsequent notice, received on March 31, 1987, to the effect that a petition for adoption had been filed, did not end the district court's jurisdiction.

        Failure to Communicate Child's Desires to Court.

                        to the court by the guardian ad litem; why the child was not permitted to testify was missing from the record, and as he was 17 years old, his opinion carried great weight. Order eliminating reunification efforts was vacated. In

                        Prior Termination Proceedings. - In a termination of parental rights case in which a mother argued that the trial court violated her rights and committed reversible error by failing to ensure that the children had proper guardian ad litem (GAL) representation
                        throughout every critical stage of the proceeding, the 20 April 2009 order terminating the mother's parental rights was the only order currently before the appellate court. By an order filed on 19 March 2009, an individual was
                        appointed as the children's GAL; therefore, the children were represented by a GAL at the 19 March 2009 termination hearing, and any alleged violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601(a)</a></cite>,

                        Effect of Appointment But Not Representation. - Because a parent was initially appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-602" target="_self">G.S. 7B-602</a></cite> and G.S. 1A-1-17,
                        but not ultimately represented by a GAL during the termination hearing, an order terminating the parent's parental rights was invalid. In re A.S.Y., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 703 S.E.2d 797 (2010).

                        a guardian ad litem (GAL) to represent her, conducting the adjudication and disposition hearings without the presence and participation of the GAL for the mother was error.

                        pro se because the guardian ad litem was acting only in an assistive capacity, the parent had the ability to waive counsel, and the trial court adequately determined that the parent knowingly and voluntarily waived the parent's
                        right to counsel. In re A.Y., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 737 S.E.2d 160 (2013), review denied <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 235</cite>, 748 S.E.2d 539, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 1009 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the mother's request to waive counsel and represent herself in a proceeding that adjudicating her children abused and neglected juveniles because this section did not require the trial court to allow
                        parents to waive counsel and represent themselves but rather gave the trial court the discretion to do so, the court held that there was no constitutional right to self-representation for a parent in an abuse, neglect, and dependency
                        proceeding, and it was apparent that the mother was entirely under the control of her boyfriend and was incapable of understanding the effect his behavior had had on her children.

        Failure to Make Findings of Fact Regarding Waiver of Counsel.
       </b> - Although it appeared that the trial court's inquiry was adequate to determine whether the mother knowingly and voluntarily waived her right to counsel during the permanency planning hearing, the trial court failed
                        to make findings of fact sufficient to show that the waiver was knowing and voluntary as the permanency planning order was devoid of any findings regarding the mother's waiver of counsel and decision to proceed pro se. In re J.M.,

                        Failure to Appoint Guardian Ad Litem. - Trial court erroneously failed to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-602" target="_self">G.S. 7B-602</a></cite> where the mother
                        had mental health issues, a depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, which resulted in the daughter's dependency. In re L.M.C., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 676, 613 S.E.2d 256 (2005).

                        sponte appoint a GAL for the mother in a dependency case was error where the trial court was on notice of the mother's alleged mental conditions, and made references to and questioned the mother's mental condition in several orders.

                        Because a petition did not mention any developmental disabilities or limitations and the mother's brief cited nothing in the record indicating that her inability to care for her children without constant assistance was due to her mental health issues,
                        the court did not err in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem. In re J.J., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 637 S.E.2d 258 (2006), aff'd, cert. dismissed, in part, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 172</cite>,

                        rather, the majority of the dependency allegations focused on the father's alleged abuse and neglect as exhibited by his noncompliance with court-ordered domestic violence counseling and a pattern of abuse against his wife and

                        Mother Was Not Entitled to Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem During Termination of Parental Rights Action. - Mother was not entitled to the appointment of a guardian ad litem in an action to terminate her parental rights; the mother's sparse references
                        to her need to counseling and drug treatment did not rise to the level of being so intertwined with the neglect of her children and to be virtually inseparable and while the Department of Social Services recommended counseling,
                        there was no significant evidence in the record to suggest that the mother's parental rights were terminated due to any mental illness or substance abuse. In re As.L.G., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite>                        551, 619 S.E.2d 561 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Appointment of a guardian ad litem was not compelled because the mother's mental illness was not a central factor in the trial court findings. In re J.M.W., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 788, 635 S.E.2d 916 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Allegations of Parental Condition Triggers Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem. - Department of social services "alleged" that the mother's dependency and mental illness were the cause of her child's problems so, even without allegations of specific facts,
                        it was error under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-602" target="_self">G.S. 7B-602</a></cite> for the lower court not to appoint a guardian ad litem for her before it adjudicated whether her child

                        Adoption as a Consequence of Neglect Proceedings. - Where the signing of the adoption consent forms occurred following and as a consequence of a neglect proceeding which the department of social services initiated, the signing of the papers directly related
                        to the neglect proceedings and respondent was entitled to counsel when she signed the forms. In re Maynard, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 616, 448 S.E.2d 871 (1994).

                        Delay in Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem Did Not Cause Prejudice as Mother Was Adequately Represented at Critical Stages. - Because the mother was adequately represented by the guardian ad litem at every critical stage of the case, the one and a half
                        month delay in appointing a guardian ad litem did not cause the mother prejudice. In re H. W., <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 594 S.E.2d 211 (2004).

        Relation to Civil Procedure Rules.
       </b> - Trial court did not err by disallowing a deposition under the Rules of Civil Procedure; as the Juvenile Code provided for discovery, specifically including depositions, the Rules of Civil Procedure did not apply here.
                        The trial court merely instructed the father to cancel the noticed civil deposition and affirmed that he could request a deposition later in the juvenile proceeding. In re M.M., - N.C. App. - , 845 S.E.2d 888 (2020).

                        Denial to Interview Child Was Not Abuse of Discretion. - Trial court did not err by denying a mother's motion to interview her son for whom a proceeding was initiated against the mother for termination of her parental rights because, as evidenced by the
                        multiple findings of fact contained within multiple court orders, any contact the mother had with the child was disruptive to his own therapeutic progress and it was clear from the record that the trial court was concerned with
                        the mother's behavior in attempting to learn of the child's whereabouts, particularly since the mother abducted the child from his school bus stop while he was in foster care. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite>                        1, 616 S.E.2d 264 (2005).

                        Denial of Continuance Was Not Abuse of Discretion. - Trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion by applying an administrative order governing all discovery in abuse, neglect, and dependency proceedings and denying the parents' motions to continue
                        because the gravamen of the problem fell with the inability of the attorneys to make time to review the records in accordance with the administrative order. In re J.S., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                        79, 641 S.E.2d 395 (2007).

        Discovery Not Denied.
       </b> - Trial court did not refuse to allow the father to depose the social worker; the trial court instructed the father to first avail himself of the information sharing provisions under the statute, while explicitly leaving
                        open the possibility that he could later file a motion for discovery requesting a deposition. As the trial court did not exercise its discretion under the statute to deny a discovery request, it could not have abused its discretion.

                        Allowing Amendment Discretionary. - Where petition sufficiently alleged the offense of larceny, and amendment in no way changed the nature of the offense, but simply identified more specifically the owner of the property allegedly stolen, allowing the
                        amendment under these circumstances was within the sound discretion of the court. In re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 437, 181 S.E.2d 162, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 616</cite>,
                        184 S.E.2d 267 (1971), decided under former G.S. 7A-285.

                    <p>
                        Improper Petition Amendment. - Trial court erred in adjudicating a child to be a neglected juvenile where the petition alleged only that the child was a dependent juvenile, the trial court had essentially amended the nature of the juvenile petition by
                        allowing the department to proceed on a claim of neglect, and as a result the mother had no notice of the claim of neglect. In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 644 S.E.2d 640 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's decision to allow the Department of Social Services to amend its petition to add sexual abuse allegations against a second child was erroneous because it changed the nature of the conditions relied upon in the original petition. In re M.G.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 536, 653 S.E.2d 581 (2007), aff'd in part and rev'd in part <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 958 (N.C. Ct. App. 2010).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the trial court erred in allowing the county department of social services to amend the petitions to terminate a mother's parental rights to conform to the evidence, the original petitions failed to put the mother on notice that
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite> would be a possible ground to support termination, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                        N.C. R. Civ. P. 15(b) did not apply, the termination order was reversed. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 660 S.E.2d 255 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 674</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 320 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Construction. - The North Carolina Supreme Court construed former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa51s7A-627" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-627</a></cite> (see now this section) to permit a juvenile petition
                        to be amended only if the amended petition does not charge the juvenile with a different offense. In re Davis, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 253, 441 S.E.2d 696 (1994).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Petition Could Be Amended. - Trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the juvenile petition that the caseworker filed in the termination of parental rights case regarding the father even though the caseworker did not sign the juvenile
                        petition; the caseworker verified the petition, which was sufficient to confer jurisdiction, and in any event, would have been allowed to amend the petition by signing it if not signing it was a problem. In re D.D.F.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 654 S.E.2d 1 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Amendment to a juvenile petition alleging abuse, neglect, and dependency to add allegations of sexual abuse did not change the nature of the conditions upon which the petition was based in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-800" target="_self">G.S. 7B-800</a></cite>,
                        because the amendment did not change the nature of the condition DSS had already alleged, abuse under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(1)</a></cite>. In re M.G., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 570</cite>,

                        Exclusion of Public. - It has never been the practice in juvenile proceedings wholly to exclude parents, relatives or friends, or to refuse juveniles the benefit of counsel. Even so, such proceedings are usually conducted without admitting the public
                        generally. In re Burrus, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879 (1969), aff'd sub nom. McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Prejudice Not Shown After Continuance. - Father failed to show prejudice from the completion of a dispositional hearing 84 days after the conclusion of the adjudication hearing and 54 days after the deadline established by
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-901" target="_self">G.S. 7B-901</a></cite> as the delay was due in part to the father's failure to complete his psychological evaluation and the parents' joint motion for a continuance as:
                        (1) the trial court continued the dispositional hearing under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-803" target="_self">G.S. 7B-803</a></cite> based on its need to review the father's psychological evaluation; (2) the parents
                        requested a continuance of the case; (3) the adjudication hearing was conducted within the 60-day deadline established by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-801ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-801(c)</a></cite>; (4) the dispositional
                        order was entered less than 30 days after the dispositional hearing under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-905ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-905(a)</a></cite>; and (5) reunification efforts were not ceased until the dispositional
                        hearing. In re C.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 644 S.E.2d 588 (2007).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        It is a discretionary matter with the trial judge whether the general public (which includes newspaper reporters) is excluded from a juvenile hearing. In re Potts, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 188 S.E.2d 643,
                        cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 622</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 471 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Show Delay was Prejudicial. - Failure to hold a timely hearing as required under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-801" target="_self">G.S. 7B-801</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-803" target="_self">G.S. 7B-803</a></cite>                        was not erroneous where respondents failed to show prejudice as a result of any delay; at the adjudication and dispositional stage it was the status of the juvenile that was at issue, and because parental status was not at issue,
                        it was more difficult for respondents to show prejudice. In re B.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 643 S.E.2d 644 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for delays in a child neglect case based on various continuances, most of the delay was attributed to respondent-parents' search for an expert witness, and their request for a special trial setting, and not as they argued, due to the trial court; any
                        assignment of error based on <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-801ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-801(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-803" target="_self">G.S. 7B-803</a></cite>                        was overruled. In re T.M., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 694, 654 S.E.2d 502 (2007).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Delay Not Justified by Continuances. - Trial court, which continued a neglect and dependency case seven times due to a crowded docket, three times due to the absence of parties, and four times due to the absence of attorneys, did not abuse its discretion
                        when it continued the case due to an attorney's medical needs and again due to a death in the mother's family, as these situations might have been considered extraordinary circumstances justifying a continuance. However, a new
                        trial was required because the court abused its discretion by continuing the case the other times in a manner inconsistent with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-803" target="_self">G.S. 7B-803</a></cite>;
                        therefore, the court's violations of the time limits set out in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-801ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-801(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906(a)</a></cite>                        (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>) were not justified, and the mother and the fathers of her two children were prejudiced by the delays. In re R.L., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite>                        529, 652 S.E.2d 327 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Authority to Adjudicate. - Trial court had authority or jurisdiction to hear the case because the adjudicatory hearing was commenced within the 60-day period after the Department of Social Services filed its neglect petition. In re T.M.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 638 S.E.2d 236 (2006).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Default. - Just as a default judgment or judgment on the pleadings is inappropriate in a proceeding involving termination of parental rights, it is equally inappropriate in an adjudication of neglect. Thrift v. Buncombe County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 528 S.E.2d 394 (2000), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-902" target="_self">G.S. 7B-902</a></cite>.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Practice and Procedure. - Although it is proper for a court to enter a consent order in an abuse, neglect, or dependency proceeding, such an order may be entered only when all parties are present, the juvenile is represented by counsel, and all other
                        parties are either represented by counsel or have waived counsel, and sufficient findings of fact are made by the court. Sherrick v. Sherrick, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 704 S.E.2d 314
                        (2011), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-902" target="_self">G.S. 7B-902</a></cite>.
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Absence of Parents. - The respondent/mother's failure to be present at the adjudicatory hearing did not relieve the trial court of its duty to find, based on competent evidence, that the allegations of neglect contained in the petition were supported
                        by clear and convincing evidence; nor was the father's purported consent sufficient to support a finding of neglect. Thrift v. Buncombe County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite>                        559, 528 S.E.2d 394 (2000), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-902" target="_self">G.S. 7B-902</a></cite>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the absence of the father's presence, the mother's consent to the adjudication of neglect as to their daughter was insufficient to dispense with the requirement of an adjudicatory hearing. In re Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite>                        126, 566 S.E.2d 744 (2002), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-902" target="_self">G.S. 7B-902</a></cite>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in entering a consent judgment finding that a mother had neglected her children; pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-902" target="_self">G.S. 7B-902</a></cite>, consent by the father of a child
                        was insufficient to bind the mother when the mother was not present at the hearing and did not consent to the judgment, and testimony by a social worker did not meet the clear and convincing evidence requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-805" target="_self">G.S. 7B-805</a></cite>.
                        In re J.R., <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 592 S.E.2d 746 (2004), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-902" target="_self">G.S. 7B-902</a></cite>.
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consent Adjudication. - Trial court erred in adjudicating children to be neglected and dependent juveniles because the adjudication and disposition order did not meet the requirements of a valid consent adjudication order as the record contained no evidence
                        that the parties had reached a consent agreement or that the respondent parent had consented to the parent's children being adjudicated as neglected and dependent. In re K.P., <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite>                        620, 790 S.E.2d 744 (2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's order adjudicating a child to be neglected was not a valid consent adjudication order under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-801" target="_self">G.S. 7B-801(b1)</a></cite> as it simply contained the parties'
                        stipulation to certain facts. In re R.L.G., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 816 S.E.2d 914 (2018).
                        <br />

                        <b>
        Adjudication Order Was A Nullity.
       </b> - Adjudication order finding a child was abused and signed by the chief district court judge was a nullity because the parties did not and could not have stipulated to the final conclusion, and no other evidence beyond
                        the parties' stipulation was presented at the adjudication hearing; the retired judge was required to make findings of fact, adjudicated and state conclusions of law arising on those facts, and enter judgment accordingly. In re

                            Juvenile Proceedings Are Designed to Foster Individualized Disposition. - Juvenile proceedings are something less than a full blown determination of criminality. They are designed to foster individualized disposition of juvenile offenders under protection
                            of the courts in accordance with constitutional safeguards. In re Arthur, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 218 S.E.2d 869 (1975), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 640</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Juvenile proceedings are not criminal prosecutions. Nor is a finding of delinquency in a juvenile proceeding synonymous with conviction of a crime. In re Burrus, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879 (1969),
                            aff'd sub nom., McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971); In re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 437, 181 S.E.2d 162, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 616</cite>,

                        <p>
                            But Such Proceedings Are Criminal for Purposes of U.S. Const., Amend. V. - Juvenile proceedings must be regarded as "criminal" for purposes of U.S. Const., Amend. V, the privilege against self-incrimination. State v. Rush,
                            <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 186 S.E.2d 595 (1972).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Juvenile delinquency hearings place juveniles in danger of confinement, and, therefore, the proceedings are to be treated as criminal proceedings, and conducted with due process in accord with constitutional safeguards of U.S. Const., Amend. V. In re
                            Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 230 S.E.2d 198 (1976), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 711</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 203 (1977).

                        <p>
                            And Double Jeopardy Rule Applies. - Although distinctions between juvenile proceedings and criminal prosecutions still exist, they are sufficiently similar in nature that the double jeopardy provisions of the United States and North Carolina Constitutions
                            are applicable to them. Accordingly, jeopardy attaches to the initial petition once an adjudicatory hearing on the merits is held. In re Drakeford, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 113,
                            230 S.E.2d 779 (1977).

                        <p>
                            Duty of District Court. - It is the constant duty of the district court to give each child subject to its jurisdiction such oversight and control as will be conducive to the welfare of the child and to the best interest of the State, and to ensure that
                            the juvenile be carefully afforded all constitutional safeguards at every stage of the hearings. In re Eldridge, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 723, 177 S.E.2d 313 (1970).

                            Trial Judge May Question Witnesses. - The trial judge in a juvenile delinquency proceeding may question the witnesses to elicit relevant testimony and to aid in arriving at the truth. State v. Rush, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite>                            539, 186 S.E.2d 595 (1972).

                            do not apply in a juvenile delinquency proceeding where no jury is present. State v. Rush, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 186 S.E.2d 595 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Procedural Requirements. - Nothing in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-807ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-807(a)</a></cite> allowed the trial court to hold a ruling on an allegation in a petition alleging abuse, neglect,
                            or dependency in abeyance, as the trial court attempted to do in this instance; when a trial court was required to adjudicate allegations of abuse, neglect, or dependency, it must either adjudicate the juvenile as abused, neglected,
                            or dependent if the allegations were proven by clear and convincing evidence or dismiss the allegation if the necessary evidentiary showing was not made. In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 692 S.E.2d
                            182 (2010).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            trial court erred in adjudicating a child as dependent and placing her in the custody of the a social service agency because, while the trial court acknowledged that the father's paternity had been established, it made no findings and the agency made
                            no allegations and presented no evidence that the father, although a minor, was unable to provide or arrange for the care and supervision of the child. In re V.B., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                            340, 768 S.E.2d 867 (2015).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in adjudicating children to be neglected and dependent juveniles because the adjudication and disposition order did not result from a proper adjudicatory hearing as the adjudication was supported solely by two written reports submitted
                            by a county department of social services (DSS) at the hearing. As a result, the trial court's findings of fact consisted of recitations from the facts alleged in the petitions and wholesale incorporation of reports prepared
                            by the DSS. In re K.P., <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 620, 790 S.E.2d 744 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction after periodic judicial reviews were discontinued to adjudicate juveniles as abused, neglected, or dependent when a director of social services (DSS) sought court action based on a new report of abuse, neglect,
                            or dependency without the prior filing of a verified petition by the DSS. Moreover, the trial court could not proceed directly to a dispositional hearing without first conducting an adjudicatory hearing and actually adjudicating
                            the juveniles as abused, neglected, or dependent. In re T.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 803 S.E.2d 1 (2017).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Standards for Evaluation of Evidence. - The North Carolina Juvenile Code gives defendants in juvenile adjudication hearings, with certain exceptions, all rights afforded adult offenders, and thus the juvenile respondents are entitled to have the evidence
                            presented in their adjudicatory hearing evaluated by the same standards as apply in criminal proceedings against adults. In re Meaut, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 153, 275 S.E.2d 200
                            (1981).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A juvenile respondent is entitled to have evidence evaluated by the same standards as apply in criminal proceedings against adults. In re Dulaney, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 587, 328 S.E.2d 904 (1985); In re
                            Howett, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 331 S.E.2d 701 (1985); In re Bass, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 334 S.E.2d 779 (1985).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a parent is absent from a termination proceeding and the trial court preserves the adversarial nature of the proceeding by allowing the parent's counsel to cross examine witnesses, with the questions and answers being recorded, the parent must demonstrate
                            some actual prejudice in order to prevail upon appeal. In re Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 414 S.E.2d 396, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 663</cite>, 422 S.E.2d 577
                            (1992).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Absence of parent. - The respondent/mother's failure to be present at the adjudicatory hearing did not relieve the trial court of its duty to find, based on competent evidence, that the allegations of neglect contained in the petition were supported by
                            clear and convincing evidence; nor was the father's purported consent sufficient to support a finding of neglect. Thrift v. Buncombe County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite>                            559, 528 S.E.2d 394 (2000).

                        <p>
                            A motion to dismiss a juvenile petition is recognized by North Carolina statutory and case law. In re Grubb, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 452, 405 S.E.2d 797 (1991); In re J.A., <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite>                            720, 407 S.E.2d 873 (1991).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to withstand a motion to dismiss the charges contained in a juvenile petition, there must be substantial evidence of each of the material elements of the offense charged; the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the state,
                            and the state is entitled to every reasonable inference of fact which may be drawn from the evidence. In re Bass, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 334 S.E.2d 779 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Restitution Order Held Unauthorized. - Where juvenile was not petitioned or adjudicated for the delinquent act of damaging the personal property of a certain victim, the court was without authority to order him to pay any restitution to her. In re Hull,
                            <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 365 S.E.2d 221 (1988).

                            Requirements of Due Process. - So long as proceedings in the juvenile court meet the requirements of due process, they are constitutionally sound and must be upheld. This means that: (1) The basic requirements of due process and fairness must be satisfied
                            in a juvenile court adjudication of delinquency. (2) U.S. Const., Amend. XIV applies to prohibit the use of a coerced confession of a juvenile. (3) Notice must be given in juvenile proceedings which would be deemed constitutionally
                            adequate in a civil or criminal proceeding; that is, notice must be given the juvenile and his parents sufficiently in advance of scheduled court proceedings to afford them reasonable opportunity to prepare, and the notice
                            must set forth the alleged misconduct with particularity. (4) In juvenile proceedings to determine delinquency which may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile's freedom is curtailed, the child and his
                            parents must be notified of the child's right to counsel and, if unable to afford counsel, to the appointment of same. (5) Juvenile proceedings to determine delinquency, as a result of which the juvenile may be committed to
                            a State institution, must be regarded as "criminal" for purposes of U.S. Const., Amend. V, the privilege against self-incrimination. The privilege applies in juvenile proceedings the same as in adult criminal cases. In re Burrus,
                            <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879 (1969), aff'd sub nom. McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Due process for a juvenile includes written notice of specific charges in advance of hearing; notification to child and parent of the right to counsel and that, if necessary, counsel will be appointed; the privilege against self-incrimination; proof of
                            the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt; and determination of delinquency based on sworn testimony subject to cross-examination in the absence of a valid confession. In re Arthur, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C.

                            Counsel Is Required in Delinquency Proceedings. - The due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV requires that in respect of proceedings to determine delinquency which may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile's freedom is curtailed,
                            the child and his parents must be notified of the child's right to be represented by counsel retained by them, or if they are unable to afford counsel, that counsel will be appointed to represent the child. In re Garcia,
                            <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 691, 177 S.E.2d 461 (1970).

                            And This Distinction Does Not Deny Equal Protection. - Allowing a child to be adjudged undisciplined and placed on probation without benefit of counsel, while at the same time requiring counsel before a child may be adjudged delinquent, does not deny
                            equal protection of the laws to the undisciplined child. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 28</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 702 (1972).

                            Absent a statute providing for a jury trial, it is almost universally held that in juvenile court delinquency proceedings the alleged delinquent has no right under the pertinent state or federal Constitution to demand that the issue of his delinquency
                            be determined by a jury. In re Burrus, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879 (1969), aff'd sub nom. McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971).

         Consideration of Prior Juvenile Court Involvement.
        </b> - Because the prior juvenile court involvement and the civil custody order were among the matters alleged in the petition, the trial court did not violate the father's due process rights by considering this evidence.

                            Dual Role as Judge and Prosecutor Is Unconstitutional. - Due process rights of a juvenile were violated where the trial judge examined the witnesses for the State because of the absence of the district attorney or other counsel to represent the State.
                            In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 525, 263 S.E.2d 355 (1980).

                            The presiding judge in a juvenile proceeding that could lead to detention should not assume the role of prosecuting attorney where the juvenile is represented by counsel and the hearing is adversary in nature. Such procedure would clearly violate due
                            process in adult criminal prosecutions, nor would a dual role of judge and prosecutor measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment in juvenile proceedings where detention could result. In re Thomas,

                            Limitation on Right to Confront Witness. - Although former G.S. 7A-631 guaranteed respondent the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the right to confront witnesses in civil cases is subject to "due limitations." In re Barkley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 267, 300 S.E.2d 713 (1983).

                            thus, the statute did not protect a child's mother's right against self-incrimination in a juvenile abuse and neglect proceeding. In re Pittman, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 756, 561

                        Denial of Continuance Proper. - Trial court properly denied mother's request for a continuance in termination of parental rights case where nothing in the record indicated that the court requested or needed additional information in the best interests
                        of the children, that more time was needed for expeditious discovery, that the mother did not receive sufficient notice of the hearing, that extraordinary circumstances necessitated a continuance in the case, and that the mother's
                        absence from the hearing was voluntary or due to her own negligence in failing to obtain adequate transportation. In re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 559 S.E.2d 237 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Because the trial court had already allowed a biological father one continuance to allow him to better prepare, and because any lack of preparation in the first place was caused by the father's knowing failure to communicate with county health and human
                        services, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion to continue. In re E.Y.B., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 16, 2021).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a biological father's motion to continue because the biological father failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that his recent incarceration constituted an extraordinary circumstance that would justify
                        a continuance, as his inability to adequately prepare for trial was due to his own knowing inaction in the days and months leading up to the hearing. In re E.Y.B., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 16, 2021).

                        Trial court properly determined that a mother was not entitled to a continuance on the ground that she was awaiting trial for criminal charges, and the mother failed to demonstrate any violation of her constitutional rights in the denial of her motion,
                        because the charges against the mother did not arise from the "transaction or occurrence" that led to the juvenile petition but arose after the petition; the trial court provided adequate safeguards to protect her due process rights.

                        Standard of Review. - Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a mother's third motion to continue in the proceeding commenced to terminate her parental rights to her son because, though she was incarcerated prior to the hearing, such incarceration
                        was the result of her own actions in abducting the child and the preceding continuance was allowed expressly for the purpose of allowing the mother to gather the documents that she asserted she needed to obtain. In re J.B.,

                    <p>
                        Given that there was no violation of a parent's due process rights when parental rights are terminated at a hearing at which the parent was not present, respondent's motion to continue was not based on a constitutional right, and the denial of the motion
                        was reviewed for abuse of discretion. In re C.M.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 803 S.E.2d 853 (2017).

                        Denial of Stay Proper. - Trial court did not err by failing to grant the stepmother's motion to stay the proceedings because there was no statutory mandate that the trial court grant a stay; counsel for the county department of social services gave the
                        trial court several legitimate reasons for denying the motion. In re Patron, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 792 S.E.2d 853 (2016).

                        it was more difficult for respondents to show prejudice. In re B.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 643 S.E.2d 644 (2007).

                        when it continued the case due to an attorney's medical needs and again due to a death in the mother's family, as these situations might have been considered extraordinary circumstances justifying a continuance. However, a new
                        trial was required because the court abused its discretion by continuing the case the other times in a manner inconsistent with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-803" target="_self">G.S. 7B-803</a></cite>;
                        therefore, the court's violations of the time limits set out in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-801ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-801(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906(a)</a></cite>                        (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>) were not justified, and the mother and the fathers of her two children were prejudiced by the delays.

                        Prejudice Not Shown After Continuance. - Father failed to show prejudice from the completion of a dispositional hearing 84 days after the conclusion of the adjudication hearing and 54 days after the deadline established by
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-901" target="_self">G.S. 7B-901</a></cite> as the delay was due in part to the father's failure to complete his psychological evaluation and the parents' joint motion for a continuance as:
                        (1) the trial court continued the dispositional hearing under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-803" target="_self">G.S. 7B-803</a></cite> based on its need to review the father's psychological evaluation; (2) the parents
                        requested a continuance of the case; (3) the adjudication hearing was conducted within the 60-day deadline established by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-801ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-801(c)</a></cite>; (4) the dispositional
                        order was entered less than 30 days after the dispositional hearing under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-905ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-905(a)</a></cite>; and (5) reunification efforts were not ceased until the dispositional

                    <p>
                        As for delays in a child neglect case based on various continuances, most of the delay was attributed to respondent-parents' search for an expert witness, and their request for a special trial setting, and not as they argued, due to the trial court; any
                        assignment of error based on <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-801ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-801(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-803" target="_self">G.S. 7B-803</a></cite>                        was overruled.

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying respondent's motion for a continuance; counsel expected her to be in court, counsel never argued that she needed additional time to prepare for the hearing, respondent never gave any reason for her absence,
                        and prejudice was not shown. In re C.M.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 803 S.E.2d 853 (2017).

                        Motion Based upon Absence of Witness. - When the motion for a continuance is based upon the absence of a witness, the motion should be supported by an affidavit indicating the facts to be proved by the witness. In re Lail,
                        <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 238, 284 S.E.2d 731 (1981) (decided under prior law).

                    <p>
                        Preservation for Review. - Respondent failed to preserve the issue of whether the denial of the motion for a continuance violated her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, as she raised the issue for the first time on appeal. In re
                        C.M.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 803 S.E.2d 853 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Evidence was Sufficient to Support Neglect Finding. - Fact that the mother admitted to using cocaine for at least two months prior to the child's birth, the mother and the child tested positive for cocaine at the time of the child's birth, that there
                        were incidents of domestic violence between respondents, and that the mother refused to sign a safety assessment plan, provided clear and convincing evidence supporting a finding of neglect. In re B.M.,

                    <p>
                        Psychological Reports. - The clear intent of the legislature is that a hearing upon a motion for review is in the nature of a dispositional hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing, and that the formal rules of evidence,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, do not apply. Therefore, the trial court could properly consider written psychological reports in determining, on motion brought
                        by parents whose parental rights had been terminated under former G.S. 7A-289.34, whether the needs of children would be best served by modification of its previous orders concerning visitation. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                        709, 336 S.E.2d 136 (1985), decided prior to enactment of this Chapter.

                    <p>
                        Medical Records. - Although medical records were admitted (in reliance on Rule 10.3, Twelfth Judicial District Juvenile Case Management Plan) into evidence without proper foundation, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>,

                        pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-804" target="_self">G.S. 7B-804</a></cite> - the rules of evidence in civil cases were to apply to child neglect cases, respondents, parents of the children, who were found neglected,
                        had the burden of showing prejudice at the admission of the records; but they could not, given the other extensive direct testimony from medical experts upon which it was presumed the trial court had relied. In re T.M., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite>                        694, 654 S.E.2d 502 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Absence of parent. - The respondent/mother's failure to be present at the adjudicatory hearing did not relieve the trial court of its duty to find, based on competent evidence, that the allegations of neglect contained in the petition were supported by
                        clear and convincing evidence; nor was the father's purported consent sufficient to support a finding of neglect. Thrift v. Buncombe County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite>                        559, 528 S.E.2d 394 (2000).

        Judicially Noticed Findings.
       </b> - Notwithstanding the trial court's authority to take notice of the court's own orders, it was problematic to allow the trial court's findings in the first order on nonsecure custody to serve as the sole support for
                        most findings in the neglect adjudication; the trial court was not bound by the rules of evidence at the custody hearing and respondents had no right to appeal, and to allow the trial court to find adjudicatory facts by taking
                        judicial notice of the court's prior findings undermined the procedural safeguards for adjudications. In re J.C.M.J.C., - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 670 (2019).

                        Standards of Evidence. - In a juvenile adjudicatory hearing, the respondent is entitled to have the evidence evaluated by the same standards as apply in criminal proceedings against adults. The State, therefore, must present substantial evidence of each
                        essential element of the offense charged and of respondent's being the perpetrator. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 348 S.E.2d 823 (1986).

                        Court reversed a trial court's order adjudicating a mother's children as neglected, because the county department of social services did not present any evidence by which the trial court could have made any findings of fact or conclusions of law as required

                        attributed to rolling off the couch as the father contended happened when he went to get a bottle for the infant, the proof was insufficient to show that the mother had neglected the infant; she was not at home when the incident

                        Trial court did not err in concluding that the minor child was a neglected juvenile, as the allegation in the petition that the minor child was neglected because the minor child lived in an environment injurious to the minor child's welfare was proven
                        by clear and convincing evidence; indeed, the evidence showed that the minor child's older sibling was adjudicated abused and neglected because the mother's boyfriend, who was cohabitating with the mother at the time of the abuse,
                        pled guilty to several felony sex offenses. In re D.S.A., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 641 S.E.2d 18 (2007).

                        Burden of Persuasion in Summary Ejectment Action. - Dismissal of a summary ejectment action was error because a trial court held the landlord to a clear, cogent, and convincing evidence standard, and in a summary ejectment action, the landlord's burden
                        of persuasion was by the preponderance of the evidence as set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.042.html#t42a03s42-30" target="_blank">G.S. 42-30</a></cite>; this standard also applied

                        relief sought from trial court's failure to state the standard of proof used in an order adjudging respondent's children abused and neglected, it remained a valid final order which was binding in a later proceeding on the facts.

                        and neglect issues decided in previous proceeding in which respondent was found to have sexually abused his children, where the trial court did not rely solely upon the previous order in a way that would have impermissibly predetermined
                        the outcome of the termination hearing, and did not deny respondent the opportunity to present evidence relevant to these issues, but merely prohibited the parties from relitigating whether respondent had, in fact, sexually abused

                        Differing Standards for Adjudicatory and Dispositional Hearings. - Trial court did not err in consolidating the adjudicatory and dispositional hearings for evidentiary purposes in the mother's case alleging abuse and neglect against her child, as there
                        was no requirement that those two stages be conducted at separate hearings and the trial court still applied the proper, separate evidentiary standards, namely "clear and convincing evidence" for the adjudicatory stage and the
                        "best interests of the child" standard for the disposition stage. In re O.W., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 699, 596 S.E.2d 851 (2004).

                        Notwithstanding the trial court's authority to take notice of the courts own orders, it was problematic to allow the trial court's findings in the first order on nonsecure custody to serve as the sole support for most findings in the neglect adjudication;
                        the trial court was not bound by the rules of evidence at the custody hearing and respondents had no right to appeal, and to allow the trial court to find adjudicatory facts by taking judicial notice of its prior findings undermined
                        the procedural safeguards for adjudications. In re J.C.M.J.C., - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 670 (2019).

                        Absence of parent. - The respondent/mother's failure to be present at the adjudicatory hearing did not relieve the trial court of its duty to find, based on competent evidence, that the allegations of neglect contained in the petition were supported by
                        clear and convincing evidence; nor was the father's purported consent sufficient to support a finding of neglect. Thrift v. Buncombe County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite>                        559, 528 S.E.2d 394 (2000).

                        was insufficient to bind the mother when the mother was not present at the hearing and did not consent to the judgment, and testimony by a social worker did not meet the clear and convincing evidence requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-805" target="_self">G.S. 7B-805</a></cite>.

                        The evidence before the trial court was sufficient to support its findings of abuse and neglect where: (1) Child, while in respondent's sole care, suffered multiple burns over a wide portion of her body; (2) no accidental cause was established, and the
                        child in fact stated that respondent burned her; (3) the burns were serious, requiring prompt medical attention; (4) respondent did not seek treatment for the child's injuries and refused to permit social worker to do so; and (5)
                        the child was taken for treatment only upon the intervention of the sheriff's department, over respondent's opposition. In re Hayden, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 384 S.E.2d 558 (1989).

                        The trial court's findings of fact regarding child's status as an abused juvenile were supported by clear and convincing evidence where the child testified that her father had shown her a picture of a woman wearing a see-through dress, the child's friend
                        drew a picture in court of what she had seen, i.e. the father's anatomy, a social worker testified that the child had told her that her father had "asked her to touch his penis," and a doctor testified that the child had told her
                        that her father had asked her to look at a "dirty book." In re Cogdill, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 528 S.E.2d 600 (2000).

                        Evidence before the trial court was sufficient to support its findings of abuse and neglect where three physicians, two of whom were experts in the area of child abuse, testified that the juvenile was the victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a form
                        of child abuse with a substantial risk of morbidity and even mortality, possibly induced by the mother either smothering the juvenile or administering a toxin. In re McCabe, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite>                        673, 580 S.E.2d 69 (2003).

                        Despite an appellate court's determination that several of the trial court's findings of fact were not supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in a neglect and abuse case, it also found that several findings of fact were so supported and provided
                        sufficient evidence to uphold the neglect and abuse adjudication of a mother's infant child based on the mother's (1) whereabouts to have been unknown upon the baby's discharge from the hospital, (2) testing positive for marijuana
                        since the adjudication hearing, (3) refusal to attend several substance abuse assessments, (4) failure to make progress on her psychological problems, and (5) abuse and neglect adjudication regarding an older daughter. In re M.J.G.,

                        Social services department presented clear, cogent, and convincing evidence from which the trial court could find and conclude that child was at risk of some physical, mental, or emotional impairment where the mother kept the child at her cousin's home
                        in a filthy room with clothes and dirty diapers strewn about, she would leave the home for several days at a time and, upon her return, she would sleep for long periods of time with the child in the bed and would not awaken when
                        the child cried, the mother came home drunk or under the influence of drugs on one occasion and attempted to remove the child from the home in the middle of the night, and the mother was unable to complete a substance abuse treatment

        Finding that areas of the brain effected by infarctions would not regenerate was supported by clear and convincing evidence.
       </b> - In a case alleging abuse, neglect, and dependency, a medical expert explained that with an infarction, part of the brain tissue begins to swell, will become damaged, and will either scar down or just go away; the
                        damaged portion of the brain typically will not regenerate. Thus, based on the expert's testimony, the trial court's finding of fact that the areas effected by the infarctions will not regenerate was supported by clear and convincing

                        court declined to extend its holding in In re Church to find reversible error based on the failure of the consent adjudication order to state the evidentiary standard contained in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-805" target="_self">G.S. 7B-805</a></cite>.

        Adjudication Order Was A Nullity.
       </b> - Adjudication order finding a child was abused and signed by the chief district court judge was a nullity because the parties did not and could not have stipulated to the final conclusion, and no other evidence beyond
                        the parties' stipulation was presented at the adjudication hearing; the retired judge was required to make findings of fact, adjudicated and state conclusions of law arising on those facts, and enter judgment accordingly. In re

                        Sufficiency of the Recording of Proceedings - Where it appeared that very little of the testimony from a termination of parental rights proceeding was not recorded, and the interruptions in the recording due to the ending of tapes and the malfunctioning
                        of equipment were only very brief, and where the trial court's extensive findings indicated a careful evaluation of all of the evidence, the appellate court's review of the record, without the benefit of a narration of the missing
                        evidence, failed to show any prejudice to the mother from the missing testimony. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 75, 582 S.E.2d 657 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When, in a termination of parental rights proceeding, one day's testimony was not recorded, the father appealing the trial court's subsequent judgment did not show that he was prejudiced, as he made no attempt to reconstruct the evidence not recorded,
                        made only general allegations of prejudice in his appellate brief, and a review of the transcript indicated much of the missing testimony was clearly referenced and repeated by the witnesses, including the father, during the hearing's
                        second day. In re Bradshaw, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 677, 587 S.E.2d 83 (2003).

                        Party Failed to Reconstruct Destroyed Transcript. - Mother's argument that she had been denied due process in a review hearing on a change to her child's permanence plan was rejected where the record on appeal had been settled without any transcript from
                        an earlier review hearing, at no point did the mother attempt to provide the appellate court with a narrative of that proceeding in the trial court, and as a result it could not be said that she had done all that she could do to
                        reconstruct the missing transcript. In re L.B., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 442, 646 S.E.2d 411 (2007).

                        Legislative Intent. - Although <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109</a></cite> does not specifically require the trial court to affirmatively state in its order terminating parental rights that
                        the allegations of the petition were proved by clear and convincing evidence, this section does require such a statement, and without such an affirmative statement the appellate court is unable to determine if the proper standard
                        of proof was utilized for its ruling on parental termination. In re Church, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 654, 525 S.E.2d 478 (2000).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When construing this section and 7B-1109(f) together to determine legislative intent, like this section, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(f)</a></cite> requires the trial court to affirmatively
                        state in its order the standard of proof utilized in the termination proceeding. In re Church, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 654, 525 S.E.2d 478 (2000).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statutory use of "shall" is a mandate to trial judges requiring them to affirmatively state that the allegations of the juvenile petition are proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Failure to follow the mandate of the statute is error. In re Wade,
                        <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 313 S.E.2d 862 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the judge finds that the allegations in the petition have been proved, as provided in G.S. 7A-635 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-805" target="_self">G.S. 7B-805</a></cite> and 7B-2409), i.e., beyond a reasonable
                        doubt, he shall so state. The failure of the trial judge to follow the clear mandate of the statute is error. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 331 S.E.2d 756 (1985).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is reversible error for a trial court to fail to state affirmatively that an adjudication of delinquency is based upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 348 S.E.2d 823
                        (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The order of the trial judge must affirmatively state that the allegations are proved beyond a reasonable doubt, even in cases where the juvenile admits the offense alleged. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite>                        336, 352 S.E.2d 889 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statutory use of the word "shall" mandates trial judges to affirmatively state that the reasonable doubt standard was followed. Failure of the trial judge to follow the clear mandate of the statute is error. In re Mitchell,
                        <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 164, 359 S.E.2d 809 (1987).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Procedural Requirements. - Nothing in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-807ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-807(a)</a></cite> allowed the trial court to hold a ruling on an allegation in a petition alleging abuse, neglect, or
                        dependency in abeyance, as the trial court attempted to do in this instance; when a trial court was required to adjudicate allegations of abuse, neglect, or dependency, it must either adjudicate the juvenile as abused, neglected,
                        or dependent if the allegations were proven by clear and convincing evidence or dismiss the allegation if the necessary evidentiary showing was not made. In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 692 S.E.2d 182
                        (2010).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction after periodic judicial reviews were discontinued to adjudicate juveniles as abused, neglected, or dependent when a director of social services (DSS) sought court action based on a new report of abuse, neglect,
                        or dependency without the prior filing of a verified petition by the DSS. Moreover, the trial court could not proceed directly to a dispositional hearing without first conducting an adjudicatory hearing and actually adjudicating
                        the juveniles as abused, neglected, or dependent. In re T.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 803 S.E.2d 1 (2017).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Stipulations. - At best, a mother entered into a stipulation where the trial court read facts into the record noting that a child tested positive for morphine at birth and that the mother had used illegal substances during her pregnancy, and the mother
                        then agreed to those facts under oath. In re L.G.I., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 512, 742 S.E.2d 832 (2013).

                        Binding Effect of Order Failing to State Standard of Proof When Not Appealed. - A trial court's failure to state the standard of proof used in making a determination of abuse or neglect constitutes error. However, because no appeal was taken or other
                        relief sought from trial court's failure to state the standard of proof used in an order adjudging respondent's children abused and neglected, it remained a valid final order which was binding in a later proceeding on the facts.

                        and neglect issues decided in previous proceeding in which respondent was found to have sexually abused his children, where the trial court did not rely solely upon the previous order in a way that would have impermissibly predetermined
                        the outcome of the termination hearing, and did not deny respondent the opportunity to present evidence relevant to these issues, but merely prohibited the parties from relitigating whether respondent had, in fact, sexually abused
                        his children. In re Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 189, 360 S.E.2d 458 (1987).

                        Adjudication Supported by Evidence - Trial court's finding of abuse and neglect were based on clear and convincing evidence where three physicians, two of whom were experts in the area of child abuse, testified that the juvenile was the victim of Munchausen
                        syndrome by proxy, a form of child abuse with a substantial risk of morbidity and even mortality, possibly induced by the mother either smothering the juvenile or administering a toxin. In re McCabe,

                        In a case where there was an adjudication of dependency, neglect, and abuse, any error in the admission of the child's hearsay statements was harmless because the other evidence alone supported a finding of dependency and neglect. The evidence at trial
                        clearly showed (1) the mother violated a safety plan by leaving the child alone with men who were alleged to be sexually abusing her; (2) an examining doctor found extensive eroding dental caries going into the gums and a one-inch
                        linear scar on the child's lower leg that was opined to be inflicted by the mother with either a shoe, a stick with thorns, or the metal part of a belt; (3) the mother called the child a "whore" and a "bitch" and further stated
                        that the child was no longer her daughter and that she was on her own and no longer had a mother; and (4) expert testimony that the child displayed symptoms of anxiety, anger, disassociation, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

                        Termination of a mother's parental rights to her two minor children was upheld on appeal where the unchallenged findings of fact made by the trial court established by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in the record that the mother had willfully
                        left her children in foster care without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their placement. The findings supporting that conclusion included: the children were in foster care for over 12 months; the
                        mother missed seven out of eleven appointments and failed to complete a substance abuse treatment program; missed five out of ten parenting classes; tested positive for drugs several times; failed to establish a permanent residence

                        left their residence with the father, but no kidnapping was reported, and an Amber Alert was not issued; (3) the district attorney's office dismissed the charges against the father for communicating threats to and assault by pointing

                        Continuance at Request of Juvenile. - Former G.S. 7A-639 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-808" target="_self">G.S. 7B-808</a></cite> and 7B-2413) and former G.S. 7A-640 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-901" target="_self">G.S. 7B-901</a></cite>                        and 7B-2501) make clear the legislative intent that the dispositional hearing must be continued for the juvenile respondent to present evidence when he requests such a continuance. This is particularly so in light of the provision
                        of former G.S. 7A-632 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-803" target="_self">G.S. 7B-803</a></cite> and 7B-2406) that "The judge may continue at any time any case to allow additional factual evidence, social information
                        or other information needed in the best interest of the juvenile or in the interest of justice." In re Vinson, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 640</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 591 (1979), decided prior to enactment of this Chapter.

                        Court's Order Upheld in Spite of Absence of Required Information. - The court rejected the defendant's contention that the juvenile court erred in making its dispositional order because it had insufficient social, medical, psychiatric, psychological,
                        and educational information regarding the juvenile, under former 7A-639, where the juvenile and his parents refused to participate in any assessments with the court counselor either before or after the adjudicatory hearing. In
                        re Clapp, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 14, 526 S.E.2d 689 (2000).

                        Trial Court Did Not Improperly Consider Dispositional Evidence. - Trial court did not improperly consider dispositional evidence in determining whether minor children were abused and neglected, because there was substantial evidence upon which the trial
                        court could conclude the minor children were abused and neglected, and, in the judgment, the trial court rendered one set of findings of fact; thereafter, in the same judgment, the trial court rendered its adjudicatory and dispositional
                        conclusions of law. Thus, the findings of fact were used to support both the adjudication and dispositional orders. In re Mashburn, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 591 S.E.2d 584 (2004),

                <p>
                    The purpose of dispositions in juvenile actions is to design an appropriate plan to meet the needs of the juvenile and to achieve the objectives of the State in exercising jurisdiction. If possible, the initial approach should involve working with the
                    juvenile and the juvenile's family in their own home so that the appropriate community resources may be involved in care, supervision, and treatment according to the needs of the juvenile. Thus, the court should arrange for appropriate
                    community-level services to be provided to the juvenile and the juvenile's family in order to strengthen the home situation.

         Many of the following cases were decided prior to the enactment of this Chapter.
        </b>

                    <p>
                        Purpose of Juvenile Code. - The stated purpose of the North Carolina Juvenile Code is to avoid commitment of the juvenile to training school (now youth development center) if he could be helped through community-level resources. In re Hughes,
                        <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 273 S.E.2d 324 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Discretion of Court. - It was the legislature's intention that the district courts exercise sound discretion in fashioning an appropriate response to each particular instance of delinquency. In re Brownlee, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 532</cite>,
                        272 S.E.2d 861 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Duty of District Court. - It is the constant duty of the district court to give each child subject to its jurisdiction such oversight and control as will conduce to the welfare of the child and to the best interest of the State, and to ensure that the
                        juvenile be carefully afforded all constitutional safeguards at every stage of the hearings. In re Eldridge, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 723, 177 S.E.2d 313 (1970).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The court is required to consider the welfare of the delinquent child as well as the best interest of the State. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 251 S.E.2d 643 (1979).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What Judge Must Determine. - This section necessarily requires the judge to first determine the needs of the juvenile and then to determine the appropriate community resources required to meet those needs in order to strengthen the home situation of the
                        juvenile. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Determination of Child's Interest. - What is or is not in the best interest of the child must be determined in tandem with the perception of the legislature as to what is in the best interest of the state as enunciated by the terms of the Juvenile Code
                        and by its general theme as deduced from the impetus behind its enactment. In re Brownlee, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 532</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 861 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Restitution Not in Children's Best Interest. - Where there was insufficient evidence before the juvenile court that the juveniles had or could reasonably acquire the means to pay $539.50 each in restitution within twelve months, it was not in their best
                        interest to require such. In re McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 143, 530 S.E.2d 334 (2000).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Least Restrictive Disposition Must Be Selected. - In selecting among dispositional alternatives, the trial judge is required to select the least restrictive disposition, taking into account the seriousness of the offense, degree of culpability, age, prior
                        record, and circumstances of the particular case. The judge must also weigh the State's best interest and select a disposition consistent with public safety, and within the judge's statutorily granted authority. In re Bullabough,
                        <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Court Limited to Using Available Dispositional Alternatives. - The district court's authority in juvenile dispositions is limited to utilization of currently existing programs or those for which the funding and machinery for implementation is in place.
                        In re Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 167, 352 S.E.2d 449 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a student has been lawfully suspended or expelled pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115C.html#t115CsVIa27s115C-391" target="_blank">G.S. 115C-391</a></cite> and the school has not provided a suitable
                        alternative educational forum, court-ordered public school attendance is not a dispositional alternative available to the juvenile court judge, absent a voluntary reconsideration of or restructuring of the suspension by the school
                        board to allow the student's restoration to an educational program within its system. In re Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 167, 352 S.E.2d 449 (1987).

                    <p>
                        District Court Not Authorized to Require Creation of Foster Home. - The district court is not authorized to require a county Department of Social Services, either by itself or in conjunction with another agency, to implement the creation of a foster home
                        with appropriate staff, wherein juveniles might be permanently domiciled for program treatment and delivery of services. In re Wharton, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 565</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 688 (1982).

                    <p>
                        Identical Judgments Erroneous for Varying Offenses and Culpability. - The juvenile court failed to consider the express purposes of the Juvenile Code where it entered identical judgments in all six cases tried together, and in which the juveniles ranged
                        in age from 6 to 14, were found to have committed and admitted committing different offenses, and had varying degrees of culpability. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 352 S.E.2d

                        reports or other evidence concerning the needs of the juvenile. The juvenile and the juvenile's parent, guardian, or custodian shall have the right to present evidence, and they may advise the court concerning the disposition they
                        believe to be in the best interests of the juvenile. The court may consider any evidence, including hearsay evidence as defined in G.S. 8C-1, Rule 801, including testimony or evidence from any person who is not a party, that the
                        court finds to be relevant, reliable, and necessary to determine the needs of the juvenile and the most appropriate disposition.

                        and efforts undertaken to establish paternity when paternity is an issue. The order may provide for specific efforts in determining the identity and location of any missing parent and specific efforts in establishing paternity.

                    <p>
                        Applicability. - Subsection (c) did not apply to the initial disposition because the trial court's order did not place the child in the custody of a county department of social services. In re H.L., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite>                        450, 807 S.E.2d 685 (2017).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidentiary Standards - Formal rules of evidence do not apply to dispositional hearings in abuse and neglect cases. In re M.J.G., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 638, 608 S.E.2d 813 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in consolidating the adjudicatory and dispositional hearings for evidentiary purposes in the mother's case alleging abuse and neglect against her child, as there was no requirement that those two stages be conducted at separate
                        hearings and the trial court still applied the proper, separate evidentiary standards, namely "clear and convincing evidence" for the adjudicatory stage and the "best interests of the child" standard for the disposition stage.
                        In re O.W., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 699, 596 S.E.2d 851 (2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court properly received various reports at a permanency planning hearing because (1) a mother did not object, waiving any contest, and (2) the North Carolina Rules of Evidence did not apply. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite>                        255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                    <p>
                        What Evidence Must Be Considered. - Whenever the trial court is determining the best interest of a child, any evidence which is competent and relevant to a showing of the best interest of that child must be heard and considered by the trial court, subject
                        to the discretionary powers of the trial court to exclude cumulative testimony. Without hearing and considering such evidence, the trial court cannot make an informed and intelligent decision concerning the best interest of the
                        child. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 567 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At a dispositional hearing the trial judge is not restricted to consideration of only those acts for which there had been an adjudication. If the information presented is determined by the trial judge to be reliable, accurate and competently obtained,
                        he may properly consider it. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence Properly Considered. - Trial court could be presumed to have disregarded the incompetent evidence because the trial court made no findings pertaining to hearsay evidence in support of its adjudication of neglect and dismissed the sexual abuse
                        allegation, and the trial court was authorized to consider the hearsay evidence and other evidence to show propensity in its dispositional order. In re A.L.T., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite>                        443, 774 S.E.2d 316 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by ceasing reunification efforts because its findings made clear that the trial court considered the evidence in light of whether reunification would be futile or inconsistent with the child's health, safety, and
                        need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable period of time. In re S.R.J.T., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 6, 2021).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by ceasing reunification efforts because its findings made clear that the trial court considered the evidence in light of whether reunification would be futile or inconsistent with the child's health, safety, and
                        need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable period of time. In re S.R.J.T., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 6, 2021).

                        Corroborative Evidence Properly Excluded. - Trial court did not err under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-901" target="_self">G.S. 7B-901</a></cite> by excluding corroborative evidence from the mother's sister, regarding
                        statements made by the minor child about abuse by her father, which merely supported the testimony of the mother; additionally, the transcript was abounding with testimony regarding the abuse of the child by her father. In re J.S.,

                        Dispositional court must make a finding that a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the parent allowed one of the aggravating circumstances to occur, and if a trial court wishes to cease reunification efforts pursuant to one particular
                        subsection, it must make findings at disposition that a court of competent jurisdiction has already determined that the parent allowed the continuation of chronic or toxic exposure to alcohol or controlled substances that causes
                        impairment of or addiction in the juvenile. In re G.T., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 791 S.E.2d 274 (2016), aff'd, 808 S.E.2d 142, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 1022 (N.C. 2017).

                        Admissibility of Psychological Reports. - The clear intent of the legislature is that a hearing upon a motion for review is in the nature of a dispositional hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing, and that the formal Rules of Evidence,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, do not apply. Therefore, the trial court could properly consider written psychological reports in determining on motion brought
                        by parents whose parental rights had been terminated under former G.S. 7A-289.34 (see now 7B-1113), whether the needs of children would be best served by modification of its previous orders concerning visitation. In re Montgomery,

        Emotional Damage.
       </b> - Trial court did not err in its adjudicating a mother's daughter abused or in its disposition. In light of false allegations of abuse which the trial court found the mother made against the father, the appellate court
                        could not conclude that the trial court erred in providing clarity in its order when it identified the mother as the parent who created or allowed to be created serious emotional damage. In re K.W., - N.C. App. - , 846 S.E.2d 584

                        Consideration of Unadjudicated Acts Unrelated to Petition. - Trial courts giving consideration at a dispositional hearing to unadjudicated acts allegedly committed by a juvenile, unrelated to that for which he stands petitioned, must first determine that
                        such information is reliable and accurate and that it was competently obtained. This does not mean that a full "trial" must be held to make the required determination about the unrelated acts. The trial court should have wide discretion
                        in making the required determination from the sources available to it, but it must make the determination. In re Vinson, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 640</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 591 (1979).

                        Cross-Examination as to Prior Unadjudicated Acts Not Irrelevant. - Cross-examination of juvenile at dispositional hearing about twice running away from county receiving home was not irrelevant merely because the acts about which she was questioned occurred
                        prior to the delinquent act for which she was placed on probation and nothing in the record indicated that she had been adjudicated undisciplined for these acts. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                        171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

                        Effect of Failure to Hold Hearing. - Where the judge held no dispositional hearing and denied juvenile the opportunity to present evidence as to disposition, and there was no evidence to support the findings made by the judge with respect to disposition,
                        commitment order would be reversed so that the court could conduct a dispositional hearing. In re Lail, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 238, 284 S.E.2d 731 (1981).

                        Required Findings. - Trial court made no finding that a court of competent jurisdiction has already determined that the parent allowed the continuation of chronic or toxic exposure to alcohol or controlled substances that causes impairment of or addiction
                        in the juvenile; the specific findings related to the child's exposure to controlled substances were not sufficient to sustain an ultimate finding under the statute and the trial court erroneously concluded that reasonable reunification
                        efforts had to cease. In re G.T., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 791 S.E.2d 274 (2016), aff'd, 808 S.E.2d 142, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 1022 (N.C. 2017).

                        No Findings When Statute Did Not Apply. - Order contained no findings under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-901ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-901(c)</a></cite> as that subsection did not apply since the child was not placed
                        in department of social services custody; thus, when establishing permanent plans, the trial court was required to make reunification a primary or secondary plan and require reunification efforts unless it found they would be unsuccessful
                        or inconsistent with the child's health or safety, and it could make that finding even though it was the first hearing. In re H.L., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 807 S.E.2d 685 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Court erred in ordering an infant placed in guardianship because homelessness and joblessness did not per se support an abuse or neglect finding; but the court committed no error in admitting social services and guardian ad litem reports or alleged hearsay
                        where the objection to the hearsay was unpreserved. In re Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 576 S.E.2d 386 (2003).

                        made clear the legislative intent that the dispositional hearing must be continued for the juvenile respondent to present evidence when he requests such a continuance. This is particularly so in light of the provision of former
                        G.S. 7A-632 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-803" target="_self">G.S. 7B-803</a></cite> and 7B-2406) that "The judge may continue at any time any case to allow additional factual evidence, social information or other
                        information needed in the best interest of the juvenile or in the interest of justice." In re Vinson, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 640</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 591 (1979); In re Lail, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 238,

                        does not place any burden of proof upon either the parents or Department of Social Services during the dispositional hearing or the review hearing. The essential requirement at the dispositional hearing and the review hearing is
                        that sufficient evidence be presented to the trial court so that it can determine what is in the best interest of the child. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 567 (1984).

                        Evidence of Neglect Obtained From Agency and Guardian Ad Litem Reports Properly Admitted. - Despite an appellate court's determination that several of the trial court's findings of fact were not supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in a
                        neglect and abuse case, it also found that several findings of fact were so supported and provided sufficient evidence to uphold the neglect and abuse adjudication of a mother's infant child based on the mother's (1) whereabouts
                        to have been unknown upon the baby's discharge from the hospital, (2) testing positive for marijuana since the adjudication hearing, (3) refusal to attend several substance abuse assessments, (4) failure to make progress on her
                        psychological problems, and (5) abuse and neglect adjudication regarding an older daughter; the trial court did not err by admitting the evidence of the DSS and guardian ad litem's reports, because the formal rules of evidence
                        did not apply to dispositional hearings. In re M.J.G., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 638, 608 S.E.2d 813 (2005); In re C.B., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 614 S.E.2d 579 (2005).

                        Reunification Efforts. - In an adjudication, disposition, and permanency planning order concluding that the son was an abused juvenile, the trial court erred in relieving the county department of social services from making further reunification efforts
                        following the initial disposition hearing because the trial court's disposition did not contain any finding indicating that a previous court had determined one of the aggravating factors in this statute was present. In re J.M.

                    the entry of an order authorizing the juvenile's placement when the court finds that placement is necessary for the protection of the juvenile.

                        The medical evaluation of juveniles is of critical importance in proceedings involving allegations of abuse and neglect under the Juvenile Code. In re Hayden, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 384 S.E.2d 558 (1989).
                        <br />

                        The provision in subsection (6) of former G.S. 7A-286 that a juvenile judge may not commit a child directly to a mental institution was clearly designed to prevent conflicts with various statutes under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite>.
                        In re Mikels, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 230 S.E.2d 155 (1976).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> was written to provide constitutional defense, procedural, and evidentiary rules. To allow juvenile judges to commit minors to
                        mental institutions with a lesser standard than that set forth in former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> would subject such commitments to constitutional challenge
                        as a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In re Mikels, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 230 S.E.2d 155 (1976).

                        The determination of "best interest" under former G.S. 7A-647(2)c. is a conclusion because it requires the exercise of judgment; appellate review of a trial court's conclusions of law is limited to whether they are supported by findings of fact. In re
                        Helms, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 491 S.E.2d 672 (1997).

                    <p>
                        If the trial court uses the best interest of the child standard to award custody of a child to a parent, any misapplication of the constitutional presumption that a biological parent is a fit and proper person to exercise custody of her minor children
                        pursuant to Petersen v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 397</cite>, 445 S.E.2d 901 (1994), is without consequence. Rholetter v. Rholetter, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 592 S.E.2d

                        Disposition on Review of Custody Order. - During the review hearing of a trial placement pursuant to G.S. 7A-657 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906</a></cite>; repealed, see now

                        the trial court does not dismiss the case or continue the case pursuant to former G.S. 7A-657(1), then G.S. 7A-657 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906</a></cite>; repealed, see now

                        from whom custody was taken, whichever is deemed to be in the best interest of the child. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 567 (1984).

                        Participation of Parent in Assessment or Treatment. - Former G.S. 7A-650(b1) (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-904" target="_self">G.S. 7B-904</a></cite>, 7B-2702, 7B-2704) only authorizes the district court to order
                        the parent of a juvenile adjudicated as delinquent, undisciplined, abused, neglected, or dependent to participate in medical, psychiatric, psychological or other treatment ordered for the juvenile pursuant to former G.S. 7A-647(3).
                        Former G.S. 7A-650(b1) does not authorize the court to order a juvenile's parent to otherwise submit to medical, psychiatric, psychological or other assessment or treatment.

                        Evidence of prior neglect which led to an adjudication of neglect shows circumstances as they were and therefore is relevant to whether a change of circumstances has occurred since the court's order. In re Brenner, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite>                        242, 350 S.E.2d 140 (1986).

                        Standard of Proof for Termination and Removal Distinguished. - There is a substantive difference between the quantum of adequate proof of neglect and dependency for purposes of termination and for purposes of removal. The most significant difference is
                        that while parental rights may not be terminated for threatened future harm, the Department of Social Services may obtain temporary custody of a child when there is a risk of neglect in the future. In re Evans,

                        Authority to Place Child in Custody of DSS. - Under former G.S. 7A-647, once a minor is adjudicated neglected, a judge has the authority to place the child in the custody of the Department of Social Services. In re Devone,
                        <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 356 S.E.2d 389 (1987); In re Kennedy, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 632, 406 S.E.2d 307 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in placing the minor child in the custody of the county social services department despite the father's contention that the minor child could have been placed with relatives; no showing was made that suitable relatives existed,
                        especially since the father's paternity was at issue, and thus placement with the paternal grandparents as suggested by the father might not be in the best interests of the minor child since the minor child might find that they
                        were not the minor child's relatives after all. In re D.S.A., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 641 S.E.2d 18 (2007).

                        Subsection (a)(6) was not available to be invoked in a termination of parental rights case because at all times during the matter, a child was found in New Hanover County, North Carolina, and North Carolina was her home state. In re N.P., - N.C. - , -

                    <p>
                        The task at the temporary custody or removal stage is to determine whether the child is exposed to a substantial risk of physical injury because the parent is unable to provide adequate protection. In re Evans, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                        449, 344 S.E.2d 325 (1986).

                        Court Must Consider Pertinent Factors Before Ordering Commitment. - Where the trial court's findings did not sufficiently address the needs of the juvenile, such as medical or psychological evaluation, school records, home evaluation, or a history of
                        parental neglect, and the court's order did not contain sufficient findings as to community resources that might be appropriate as noncustodial alternatives to commitment, case would be remanded for further consideration of these
                        pertinent factors. In re Cousin, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 377 S.E.2d 275 (1989).

                        A finding of fact that mother was a fit and proper person to have custody of her child did not compel the conclusion that custody should be awarded to her, where the court also found that the best interests of the child required that custody remain in
                        others with whom the child was placed following a finding of dependency. In re Yow, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 688, 253 S.E.2d 647, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 610</cite>,

                        Attempt to Teach Mentally Retarded Child at Home. - Trial court did not err in finding that 15 year old with an IQ of 41, who had been taken out of public school and was being taught at home by his father, was neglected, in granting legal custody to the
                        Department of Social Services, and in ordering the child to be returned to public school. In re Devone, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 356 S.E.2d 389 (1987).

                        Where neglected juvenile's custody changes to non-custodial parent, if a trial court determines such disposition to be in the best interests of the child, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-903" target="_self">G.S. 7B-903</a></cite>,
                        there is no burden of proof at the dispositional hearing; the trial court must only consider the best interests of the child. Rholetter v. Rholetter, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 592 S.E.2d 237 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Removal of Child Upheld. - Evidence held sufficient to show that seven-year old child was exposed to a substantial risk of physical injury because of her mother's inability to maintain secure living arrangements for her, so as to permit the Department
                        of Social Services to remove her from her mother's custody until such accommodations could be provided. In re Evans, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 344 S.E.2d 325 (1986).

                    <p>
                        It was in child's best interest to continue in the custody of DSS pending mother's compliance with reunification measures where the child had lived in an environment injurious to her welfare, and where mother failed to comply with DSS's efforts to prevent
                        removal. In re Helms, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 491 S.E.2d 672 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in finding that returning children to their parents' custody would be contrary to their health, safety and welfare. because the trial court's findings of fact clearly established the children lived in an environment that was injurious
                        to their welfare given that the father and mother failed to take the children for medical treatment and inappropriately disciplined one of the children; returning the children to the parents' home was not in the children's best
                        interests. In re S.H., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 719 S.E.2d 157 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Modification Upheld. - Where court had previously deemed it in the best interest of minor children who had been adjudicated neglected that mother comply with certain orders of the court, the court acted with full statutory authority when it later conducted
                        a hearing upon social worker's subsequent motion and determined that mother's refusal to cooperate with community-level services and orders applicable to her constituted a "change of circumstances" affecting the best interest of
                        the children, sufficient to require modification of prior custody orders. In re Brenner, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 350 S.E.2d 140 (1986).

                        Termination of Visitation. - Termination of a mother's visitation with a child was not an abuse of discretion under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-901" target="_self">G.S. 7B-901</a></cite>,

                        Award of Custody to Foster Parents. - Having acquired subject matter jurisdiction, trial court, guided by the best interests of the child, had broad dispositional powers, including the power to award legal custody of child to its foster parents. In re

                        Placement With Relatives. - When, in a dependency proceeding, a trial court placed a child's custody with the child's foster parents without finding it was contrary to the child's best interests to place her with willing relatives, pursuant to

                        order that placed a juvenile with her maternal great-grandmother in South Carolina, despite the lack of approval of the great-grandmother's home by South Carolina authorities, violated the Interstate Compact on the Placement of

                        Trial court properly declined to place a mother's children with relatives because it was apparent from the court's exhaustive findings of fact that (1) the court considered several relative placements but no suitable option was available, and, (2) where
                        potentially available, the court considered it not in the children's best interests to place the children with the relative. In re T.H., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 5, 2013).

                        Trial court erred in granting guardianship of a father's child to a non-relative because the father had standing to raise the issue on appeal inasmuch as the paternal grandmother was never a party in the juvenile case, the father was asserting his own
                        interest to have the court consider a potentially viable relative placement for the child before granting guardianship to a non-relative, the question of whether the grandmother should have been given priority placement consideration
                        over a non-relative had never been addressed by the court, the trial court specifically found that both parents opposed appointing a non-relative guardian for the child and wished for the child to be placed with her grandmother
                        if the court determined she could not return to their home. In re D.S., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 194, 817 S.E.2d 901 (2018).

                        Because the county department of human services (DHS) had not received notification of the proposed placement of the children from the appropriate Arizona agency prior to entry of the permanency planning order their aunt and uncle in Arizona, the trial
                        court was not authorized to award custody of the children to their aunt and uncle in Arizona; the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children required that Arizona notify DHS the proposed placement of the children did not appear
                        to be contrary to their interests. In re J.D.M.-J., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 56, 817 S.E.2d 755 (2018).

                        There was not an appropriate relative placement available for the children, as the uncontroverted evidence and findings established that a maternal great aunt and a half-sister were not able to provide proper care and supervision of the juvenile in a
                        safe home. In re N.K., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 20, 2020).

        Failure to Consider Placement with Relatives.
       </b> - Trial court was statutorily required to consider and place the child with a family member, who was willing and able to provide a safe home for her, before consideration of a juvenile's placement with a nonrelative
                        and the court erred when it disregarded the grandmother's and father's wishes and proceeded to order guardianship with a nonrelative. In re A.N.T., - N.C. App. - , 845 S.E.2d 176 (2020).

                        Placement With Non-Relatives. - Trial court did not abuse its discretion by placing a mother's children in a non-relative placement because either no suitable relative was available or it was not in the children's best interests to place them with a relative,
                        and reunification efforts would be inconsistent with their health, safety and need for a permanent home within a reasonable period of time. In re T.H., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 753

                        to place custody of the child with someone other than a parent, the court erred in giving physical custody to the mother but ordering the child's "physical placement" to be with her maternal grandfather. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-903ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-903(a)</a></cite>                        specified the dispositional alternatives that were available in a custody matter, a "physical placement" with someone who did not have custody was not a permissible alternative under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-903ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-903(a)</a></cite>,

                        Finding of Proper Care and Supervision. - Before returning a child to the custody of a parent from whose custody the child is originally taken, a trial court must find that the child will receive from that parent the proper care and supervision in a safe
                        home. In re H.S.F., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 628 S.E.2d 416 (2006).

                        a child, to the parent from whom the child had been taken, without a hearing in which a court found that the child would receive proper care in a safe home, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(19)</a></cite>,
                        a trial court erred in changing custody of a child from a father to the mother because the court was required to find, but did not find, that the child would receive from the mother the necessary proper care and supervision in
                        a safe home, particularly in light of prior evidence that domestic violence had occurred in the home. In re H.S.F., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 628 S.E.2d 416 (2006).

                        Insufficient Findings. - While a court had the power under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-903" target="_self">G.S. 7B-903</a></cite> to enter an order transferring the custody of a minor child from her father to her mother,
                        there was no evidence in the record in a proceeding on the parties' cross-motions for contempt that supported the finding that transferring custody to the mother was in the child's best interests. It had been found in an earlier
                        proceeding that the mother was abusing prescription drugs, that her husband had been physically abusing her, and that loaded weapons were kept in their home, yet in the contempt proceeding, the trial court made no findings addressing
                        a prior adjudication in which it had been determined that the child was neglected, and no findings were made as to whether efforts to mend the mother's relationship with her husband had been resolved. In re H.S.F., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                        193, 628 S.E.2d 416 (2006).

                        the juvenile's care undergo psychiatric, psychological, or other treatment or counseling directed toward remediating or remedying behaviors or conditions that led to or contributed to the juvenile's adjudication or to the court's

                        with the juvenile's care upon that individual's compliance with the plan of treatment. The court may order the parent, guardian, custodian, stepparent, adult member of the juvenile's household, or adult relative entrusted with
                        the juvenile's care to pay the cost of treatment ordered pursuant to this subsection. In cases in which the court has conditioned legal custody or physical placement of the juvenile with the parent, guardian, custodian, stepparent,

                        the court may order that individual to receive treatment currently available from the area mental health program that serves the parent's catchment area.

                        that will cover, in whole or in part, the support of the juvenile after the order is entered. If the court requires the payment of child support, the amount of the payments shall be determined as provided in G.S. 50-13.4(c). If
                        the court places a juvenile in the custody of a county department of social services and if the court finds that the parent is unable to pay the cost of the support required by the juvenile, the cost shall be paid by the county

                        Authority of the Court. - The trial court did not have authority, pursuant to this section, to order respondent to "secure and maintain safe, stable housing and employment" nor to contact a child support enforcement department. This section is the trial
                        court's only source of authority over the parent of a juvenile adjudicated abused or neglected, and the trial court may not order a parent to undergo any course of conduct not provided for in the statute. In re Cogdill,

                        with the son, as the infant had suffered a severe head trauma while in the father's sole care, which could not have been attributed to the infant's having rolled off the couch, as the father claimed. In re J.A.G., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite>                        708, 617 S.E.2d 325 (2005).

                        Trial court erred in ordering a father to obtain and maintain stable employment under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-904" target="_self">G.S. 7B-904</a></cite> as nothing suggested that the father's employment situation,
                        or lack thereof, led to or contributed to the juvenile's adjudication as a neglected child. In re W.V., <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. App.</cite> 290, 693 S.E.2d 383 (2010).

                    <p>
                        In a case in which the district court properly determined that the younger child was abused and that both children were neglected, the district court lacked the authority to order the mother to maintain stable housing and employment because nothing in
                        the district court's findings of fact suggested that the mother's lack of employment or unstable housing contributed to the children's removal from her custody as the primary factors which led to the removal of the children in
                        November 2013 were the mother's inability to provide proper care and discipline for the children, in that she abused the younger child and neglected both children. In re H.H., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite>                        431, 767 S.E.2d 347 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Court's dispositional order requiring a child's father to maintain steady employment and obtain a domestic violence assessment and follow the assessment's recommendations did not exceed the court's authority because there was a nexus between the order's
                        requirements and the reasons for the child's removal from the father's custody. In re T.N.G., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 781 S.E.2d 93 (2015).

                        Trial Judge's Authority. - General Assembly clearly contemplated that, in the event that a juvenile is found to have been abused, neglected, or dependent, the trial judge has the authority to order a parent to take any step needed to remediate the conditions
                        that "led to or contributed to" either the juvenile's adjudication or the decision to divest the parent of custody. In re B.O.A., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 372</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 305 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Participation of Parent in Assessment or Treatment. - Former G.S. 7A-650(b1) only authorizes the district court to order the parent of a juvenile adjudicated as delinquent, undisciplined, abused, neglected, or dependent to participate in medical, psychiatric,
                        psychological or other treatment ordered for the juvenile pursuant to former G.S. 7A-647(3). Former G.S. 7A-650(b1) does not authorize the court to order a juvenile's parent to otherwise submit to medical, psychiatric, psychological
                        or other assessment or treatment. In re Badzinski, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 339 S.E.2d 80 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Former G.S. 7A-650(b1) of this section does not authorize a court to order a parent of a juvenile who has been adjudicated as dependent or neglected to submit to medical, psychiatric, psychological or other assessment or treatment. In re Evans,
                        <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 344 S.E.2d 325 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court properly ordered a father to undergo a psychological evaluation, have a substance abuse assessment, and enroll in parenting classes, as it was in the children's best interest. In re A.S., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite>                        706, 640 S.E.2d 817 (2007), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 427</cite>, 648 S.E.2d 203 (2007).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trial court properly ordered respondent to undergo a psychological evaluation and possible treatment where the evidence indicated that she knew that her daughter was being abused by her father and lied about it. In re Cogdill,
                        <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 528 S.E.2d 600 (2000).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The determination of reunification requirements is a conclusion of law because it requires the application of legal principles pursuant to former G.S. 7A-650(b2); appellate review of a trial court's conclusions of law is limited to whether they are supported
                        by findings of fact. In re Helms, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 491 S.E.2d 672 (1997).

                        Support payments ordered pursuant to former G.S. 7A-650(c) should be based on the interplay of the trial court's conclusions as to the amount of support necessary to meet the needs of the child and the ability of the parents to provide that amount. The
                        court's conclusions should in turn be based on findings of fact sufficiently specific to show that the court gave due regard to the relevant factors in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.4ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.4(c)</a></cite>                        and any other relevant factors of the particular case. When such findings are not made, the order should be vacated, because appellate courts have no means of determining whether the order is supported by the evidence and is based
                        on the proper considerations. In re Botsford, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 72, 330 S.E.2d 23 (1985).

                        Combined Hearing for Permanency Planning And Disposition. - Because a father did not object when the department of social services informed the trial court that the hearing was noticed on for both permanency planning and disposition, and it wanted to
                        proceed with both, he has waived appellate review of the propriety of the combined hearing; the father received multiple notices in the weeks and months before the hearing that the trial court would be conducting a combined adjudication,
                        disposition, and permanency planning hearing. In re H.L., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 807 S.E.2d 685 (2017).

                        Failure to Provide for Visitation. - Trial court erred in failing to provide for visitation between the mother and the mother's older two children who were placed with the father due to the mother's neglect; the trial court was required by statute to
                        provide for appropriate visitation as would be in the best interests of the minor children, consistent with their health and safety, and the trial court's failure to so provide meant the trial court had to consider the issue of
                        visitation upon remand of the case to it. In re C.P., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 698, 641 S.E.2d 13 (2007).

                    <p>
                        When a son was found to be abused and the son and a daughter were found to be neglected, a trial court's dispositional order did not comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-905ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-905(c)</a></cite>                        because the order neither provided for visitation between the children and the children's parents nor found that such visitation was not in the children's best interests. In re C.M., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 53,
                        678 S.E.2d 794 (2009).

                    <p>
                        In a child neglect hearing in which the trial court did not include a visitation plan by the mother, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-905ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-905(c)</a></cite>, the mother could not
                        be heard to complain on appeal since the trial court gave the mother exactly what she wanted. It was clear from the trial court's unchallenged findings of fact that the mother had declined to engage in visitation with the two children,
                        had expressly stated that she did not want to see them, and was generally unwilling to do anything to promote reunification between herself and the children; the mother could have hardly made her lack of interest in visiting with
                        the children clearer. In re K.C., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 557, 681 S.E.2d 559 (2009).

                        Visitation provisions of a court order failed to comply with the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-905ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-905(c)</a></cite> by failing to address "the time, place, and conditions under
                        which visitation may be exercised." In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 692 S.E.2d 182 (2010).

                        Trial court improperly incorporated the allegations from the juvenile petition as its findings of fact under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-807ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-807(b)</a></cite> in its adjudication of the child's
                        neglect or dependency due to the mother's absence from home. The trial court also erred in failing to address visitation as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-905ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-905(c)</a></cite>. In
                        the Matter of S.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 718 S.E.2d 709 (2011).

                        Trial court failed to adopt a proper visitation plan as the plan did not set forth the time, place, or conditions of the father's visitation with child one where the order provided that the department of social services was to offer supervised visitation
                        for the father every-other week and that visitation would be reduced to once a month if the father acted inappropriately during a visitation or did not attend a visit without prior notice. In re J.P.,

        Visitation Plan Insufficient.
       </b> - It was error for a trial court's dispositional order concerning a mother's children to fail to provide for visitation with the mother because (1) such a provision was statutorily required, absent findings that visitation

                        Trial court's order providing for a father's supervised visitation with his child every other week, to be reduced to once a month if he acted inappropriately, required additional findings and conclusions as to the time, place, and conditions of an appropriate

                        Mandamus Proper Remedy for Violation of Time Limit. - Trial court committed no prejudicial error where the court's failure to comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-807ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-807(b)</a></cite>                        and 7B-905(a) occurred after a dispositional and adjudicative hearing, and the three-month delay in entry of the order of adjudication and disposition could not have been remedied by a new hearing. The proper remedy would have
                        been to seek a writ of mandamus pursuant to N.C. R. App. P. 22(a) to compel the trial court to enter the order. In re T.H.T., <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 446</cite>, 665 S.E.2d 54 (2008).

                        Implication of Separation as Pre-Condition to Reunification Deemed Error. - Although the court was authorized under former G.S. 7A-651(c)(2) to find that efforts to reunite a family would be futile or inconsistent with the juvenile's safety, the court's
                        statements implying that separation of the parents was a pre-condition to the mother having a realistic chance to regain custody were prejudicial error, and the part of the court's order retaining jurisdiction was, therefore, vacated.

                        throwing rocks through some of the windows in the mobile home and nothing further, and there was no evidence in the record as to the amount of damage caused by the rocks thrown by the juveniles, dispositional order ordering restitution
                        in the amount of $3,000.00 would be vacated and the matter remanded for a new dispositional hearing, at which the court would determine the amount of damages caused to the mobile home by the rocks thrown through the windows by

                        Denial of Visitation to Father. - Trial court did not err in ordering that there be no contact between a minor child and her father because the testimony presented at a hearing along with county department of social services reports offered as evidence
                        before the trial court tended to show that the father beat the child two to three times a day with a belt, used his fist to hit the child in the mouth, stomped on the child's stomach and caused the child to sustain the injuries
                        of a fractured finger and ruptured spleen; accordingly, no amount of contact between the father and the child could have been said to be in the best interest of the child or be in anyway consistent with the health and safety of
                        the child. In re J.S., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 641 S.E.2d 395 (2007).

                        child, and the conditions that led to the kinship placement of both minor children still existed, the child was properly removed. In re A.S., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 706, 640 S.E.2d 817

                        Improper Discretion As to Visitation At Discretion of Guardian Held Error - Trial court erred in ordering visitation between mother and her child at the discretion of the guardian with whom the court vested the physical custody of the child because the
                        court, at a review hearing, was to consider and make relevant findings of fact regarding an appropriate visitation plan under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906ol1c6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906(c)(6)</a></cite>                        (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>).

                        Restriction on Visitation. - Trial court did not err in ordering that visitation between the minor child, who had been the subject of neglect proceedings in the trial court, and the parents be at the discretion of the county social services department,
                        as the trial court had the authority to do so; however, a remand of the minor child's case to the trial court was necessary because the county social services department was required to submit a visitation plan for the trial court's
                        approval. In re D.S.A., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 641 S.E.2d 18 (2007).

                        Order Allowing Parent and Child to Set Visitation Criteria Was Improper Delegation Of Trial Court's Authority. - Because the trial court's order for visitation allowed a mother and a juvenile the authority to create the criteria upon which the visitations
                        would occur, the order constituted an impermissible delegation of the trial court's authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-905" target="_self">G.S. 7B-905</a></cite>; the trial court failed
                        to include a minimum outline of the conditions under which visitation could be exercised, and the order allowed for one visit per month but provided no other details such as the time, place, or conditions under which the visitation

                        established pursuant to G.S. 7A-494. In referring a case to custody mediation, the court shall specify the issue or issues for mediation, including, but not limited to, whether or not visitation shall be supervised and whether
                        overnight visitation may occur. Custody mediation shall not permit the participants to consent to a change in custody. A copy of any agreement reached in custody mediation shall be provided to all parties and counsel and shall
                        be approved by the court. The provisions of G.S. 50-13.1(d) through (f) apply to this section.

                    If the director makes a good faith determination that the visitation plan is not consistent with the juvenile's health and safety, the director may temporarily suspend all or part of the visitation plan. The director shall not be subject to any motion
                    to show cause for this suspension but shall expeditiously file a motion for review and request that a hearing be scheduled within 30 days. However, no motion or notice of hearing is required if a review or permanency planning hearing
                    is already scheduled to be heard within 30 days of the suspension.

                    <p>
                        Visitation Plan Review. - Court did not fail to find if the court should retain jurisdiction because (1) the court did not terminate jurisdiction and said the parties could ask the court to review visitation, (2) a mother did not claim the court wrongly
                        kept jurisdiction or did not follow statutory procedures, and (3) the mother did not support a claim that transfer to an N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 50 proceeding was not analyzed. In re Y.I., <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite>                        575, 822 S.E.2d 501 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Visitation Plan Sufficient. - Visitation order, giving the mother two hour long visits, complied with the statutory mandate in this section. In re J.W., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 772 S.E.2d 249 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's order for supervised visitation as to the mother was not manifestly unsupported by reason, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting her to a minimum of one hour per week of supervised visitation with the child, because
                        the trial court had heard testimony that the parent's unsupervised visitation had previously been rescinded due to separate instances of visitation where they appeared to be under the influence, the child's guardian ad litem recommended
                        supervised visitation, and the child's therapist's letter also described concerns with changing the juvenile's routine. In re I.K., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 18, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Father's argument that the trial court failed to provide him with notice of his right to file a motion with the trial court to review the visitation plan was rejected because in open court the trial court made the parties aware in a general sense that
                        it would retain continuing jurisdiction and could review any aspect of its permanency planning order upon its own motion or that of a party. In re I.K., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 18, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visitation Plan Insufficient. - Trial court's order providing for a father's supervised visitation with his child every other week, to be reduced to once a month if he acted inappropriately, required additional findings and conclusions as to the time,
                        place, and conditions of an appropriate visitation plan. In re J.P., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 750 S.E.2d 543 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's visitation plan was insufficient because the court did not establish the duration of a mother's monthly visitation. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not fully comply with the applicable statutory requirements because its order failed to provide any direction as to the frequency or length of a mother's visits in the event that she did not return to live in Arizona, and it failed to
                        specify whether the visits with the mother would be supervised or unsupervised. In re J.D.M.-J., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 56, 817 S.E.2d 755 (2018).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visitation Order Sufficient. - Trial court properly accounted for the minimum frequency and length of visitation and provided for the visitations to be supervised by the family therapist; nothing required the court to designate a time and place for the
                        visitations. In re N.B., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 771 S.E.2d 562 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's visitation provisions were not inconsistent because the trial court's conclusion that the mother was a parent whose status conveyed a right to visitation was subject to the determination of the scope and duration of visitation as would be
                        in the best interest of the child consistent with his health and safety; the trial court's determination that the foster parents be appointed the child's guardians conveyed the parental status the mother retained following that
                        determination. In re J.L., - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 258 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying visitation because visitation with the mother was not in the child's best interest consistent with his health and safety; the trial court's ultimate finding that visitation would be inappropriate and
                        not in the child's best interest was supported by the trial court's evidentiary findings. In re J.L., - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 258 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visitation Order Insufficient. - Court's supervised visitation order erred because the court did not find related costs or whether a mother could pay such costs. In re Y.I., <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 575, 822 S.E.2d
                        501 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's visitation order was vacated because the trial court did not notify the mother of her right to file a motion for review of the visitation plan; in addition, the trial court did not inform the mother of that right in open court on the record.
                        In re J.L., - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 258 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's visitation order erred because: (1) the court ordered supervised visitation without addressing the costs of such visitation, the party liable for such costs, or a mother's ability to bear the costs; and (2) the order contained contradictory
                        provisions regarding the amount of visitation the mother was awarded. In re J.T.S., - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 637 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Portion of the dispositional order setting out the Mother's visitation was set aside and remanded for additional findings where the trial court had not determined whether any inability to pay for visitation on the mother's part would have prevented the
                        best interests of the child from being met. In re E.P.-L.M., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 4, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Impermissible Delegation of Judicial Function. - Trial court impermissibly delegated its judicial function to a father because the disposition order delegated to the father substantial discretion over kinds of visitation, such as the mother having lunch
                        with the child at school; the order also provided future, conditional expansions of the mother's visitation rights that effectively were contingent on the father deciding that the mother complied with the trial court's directives.
                        In re J.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 768 S.E.2d 172 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a trial court concluded it was not in children's best interests to return the children to the children's grandparents, the court's findings regarding the grandparents' visitation and the children's best interest were deficient because (1) the court
                        made no reference to visitation and made no findings supporting the conclusion, and (2) a finding adopting reports of the Department of Social Services and the guardian ad litem as findings of fact was insufficient. In re J.R.S.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 612, 813 S.E.2d 283 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Allowing a social services agency to expand visitation contingent upon the mother's progress with her case plan was not an impermissible delegation of judicial authority. The disposition order only gave the agency discretion to expand visitation, not
                        reduce it below the minimum set by the trial court. In re K.W., - N.C. App. - , 846 S.E.2d 584 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the grandmother, who was granted guardianship of the mother's children, was not explicitly authorized to terminate or suspend the mother's visitation, the trial court improperly delegated a judicial function to the grandmother by giving her the
                        power to unilaterally modify the mother's visitation. In re J.M., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Sept. 1, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>
        Visitation Plan Review Preserved.
       </b> - Mother's appellate claim that a trial court erred in ordering supervised visitation without addressing cost, who would bear the expense, or the mother's ability to pay that expense was considered on appeal despite
                        her failure to object because no objection was required to preserve this type of question for review. In re J.T.S., - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 637 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying visitation to a biological father because he had not contacted the children for two years, and the children did not know the biological father and had no bond with him; given the issues with the biological
                        father's transience and criminal history, and his lack of involvement throughout the children's life, it was not manifestly unreasonable to deduce that being introduced to him could be emotionally difficult. In re E.Y.B., - N.C.

                            Applicability. - Mother's argument that a permanency plan failed to comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1000ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1000(a)</a></cite> was rejected where the permanency planning order stated

                            Combined Hearing for Permanency Planning and Disposition. - Because a father did not object when the department of social services informed the trial court that the hearing was noticed on for both permanency planning and disposition, and it wanted to
                            proceed with both, he has waived appellate review of the propriety of the combined hearing; the father received multiple notices in the weeks and months before the hearing that the trial court would be conducting a combined
                            adjudication, disposition, and permanency planning hearing. In re H.L., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 807 S.E.2d 685 (2017).

                        <p>
                            Adequate Resources. - Evidence supported the finding that the child's aunt had adequate resources to care for the child; while some evidence indicated that the aunt had financial difficulties over the summer, and her testimony was lacking in specificity,
                            her sworn statement that she was willing to care for the child and possessed the financial resources to do so constituted competent evidence supporting the trial court's ruling. In re N.H.,

                        <p>
                            Because a legal father did not qualify as "an individual other than a parent" under the statute, the trial court was under no obligation to verify his understanding of his obligations or his financial resources; even if the legal father was classified
                            as "an individual other than a parent" under the statute, the trial court's order complied with the statute by including findings demonstrating both his understanding of the placement and his financial ability to care for the
                            children. In re E.Y.B., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 16, 2021).

                            Failure to Verify Guardian had Ability to Support Child. - Trial court erred in failing to verify that the guardian, the father's girlfriend, had adequate resources to care appropriately for the child, as required by this section and
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-600ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-600(c)</a></cite>, as the guardian's assurance that she had the financial and emotional ability to support the child was not sufficient evidence of such
                            ability. In re P.A.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 772 S.E.2d 240 (2015).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in awarding custody of children to their aunt and uncle because it did not receive evidence that was sufficient to support its findings regarding the adequacy of their financial resources to provide for the needs of the children; in
                            addition to the lack of sufficient evidence regarding the resources of the aunt and uncle, the trial court also heard no evidence from which it could verify that they understood the legal significance of assuming custody of
                            the children. In re J.D.M.-J., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 56, 817 S.E.2d 755 (2018).

         Child's Desires.
        </b> - Therapists' most recent recommendation was to allow the child to decide on visiting mother and the record showed the child's expressed desire and efforts to maintain contact with his mother, which was not communicated
                            to the court by the guardian ad litem; why the child was not permitted to testify was missing from the record, and as he was 17 years old, his opinion carried great weight. Order eliminating reunification efforts was vacated.

                        <p>
                            Standard Applied Was Incorrect. - Trial court did not adequately insure that a child's proposed guardians understood the legal significance of guardianship or had the means to support the child because (1) the proposed guardians did not testify, so the
                            court could not independently verify the proposed guardians' understanding, and (2) insufficient evidence of the proposed guardians' ability to support the child was introduced. In re J.H.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                        <p>
                            In a dependency action, the trial court applied the incorrect standard in assessing whether or not to change legal custody from the children's married adult sibling to the mother, failing to address custody and reunification as permanent plans and to
                            consider the best interest of the children. In re K.L., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 269, 802 S.E.2d 588 (2017).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court erred because it failed to indicate that it applied the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof in determining that a mother was unfit and had acted inconsistent with her constitutionally protected status as a parent; in addition,
                            the trial court did not state the appropriate standard in open court on the record. In re J.L., - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 258 (2019).

                            Required Findings. - Trial court failed to make findings under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1ol1n" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1(n)</a></cite>, and thus the trial court committed reversible error in ceasing further

                            Lack of Supported Findings. - That portion of the trial court's order purporting to end judicial review hearings was reversed for lack of supported and written findings of fact on all five criteria in this section. In re K.L.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 269, 802 S.E.2d 588 (2017).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in appointing relatives as guardians of a father's minor children because the court's conclusions of law were erroneous since no oral testimony was received at the permanency planning hearing; the only evidence before the trial court
                            consisted of the reports offered by the county department of social services and the guardian ad litem, and the trial court heard no testimony at the permanency planning hearing. In re S.P. &amp; J., - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d

                            Inability to Return Child to Parent Within Six Months. - Trial court adequately found a child could not be returned to the child's mother within six months because the court found the mother had not fully resolved issues of domestic violence, mental health,
                            and substance abuse and needed to continue to make progress in those areas before reunification could occur. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

         Continuance.
        </b> - Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the mother's motion to continue on the ground that she was not present at the permanency planning and review hearing because she failed to show that she was
                            prejudiced, as counsel advocated for the mother's interests in an effective manner, and counsel's representation that the mother had just entered an inpatient substance abuse treatment facility appeared to foreclose the prospect

                        <p>
                            District court's findings of fact supported the conclusion that continuation of a plan of reunification between a parent and the parent's child would have been futile and was inconsistent with the child's need for a safe, stable home within a reasonable
                            period of time. The parent-educator who worked with the parent expressed concern about the parent's ability to protect the child against abuse by the individual with whom the parent had been living and the parent's conduct
                            with the child. In re E.M., <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 790 S.E.2d 863 (2016).

                            Court did not err in not returning a mother's children because (1) the court's adjudicatory order and permanency planning hearing testimony supported finding domestic violence led to the children's removal, (2) the mother waived a contest to other findings,
                            and (3) the court found the children's father cooperated with treatment while the mother did not. In re Y.I., <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 575, 822 S.E.2d 501 (2018).

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in its permanency planning order granting guardianship of the child to her grandmother because ample evidence supported the trial court's continuing concerns with the parents' domestic violence, substance abuse,
                            and inadequate housing including the parents testing positive for using marijuana and the cluttered, crowded, dilapidated single-wide trailer in which the parents resided with their newborn and the father's mother. In re I.K.,

                            Futility of Return. - Trial court's findings did not support the trial court's conclusion that further efforts to reunify a child with the child's mother would be futile because the court found the court could consider reunification if the mother overcame
                            the mother's substance abuse and secured stable employment and housing in the next nine months. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                            Waiver of Further Hearings. - Trial court erred in ordering that further review hearings were waived after a permanency planning hearing because (1) the court did not make any findings in support of the criteria that the child had resided in placement
                            for at least one year, that neither the child's best interests nor the rights of any party required that review hearings be held every six months, or that all parties were aware that the matter could be brought back before
                            the court, and (2) the court could not find the child had been in placement for at least one year. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                            Trial court erred in waiving further review hearings because: (1) the statutory requirement that subject children had resided in the children's placement for a "period of at least one year" was interpreted to require placement for a continuous period
                            of at least 12 months, as aggregating interrupted placement periods could lead to absurd results; and (2) the subject children had not resided in the children's placement for at least 12 continuous months. In re J.T.S., - N.C.

         Hearing Untimely.
        </b> - Permanency planning hearing was untimely because (1) the hearing was required within 12 months of an order removing the subject child from the child's mother, but (2) the hearing was not held within that time.

                            of fact, awarding legal custody to a non-parent without evidence to support its findings that the potential custodians understood the legal significance of the relationship, and awarding custody to a non-parent without stating
                            that the court had applied the proper standard of proof. In re E.M., <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 790 S.E.2d 863 (2016).

                            District court erred in entering a permanency planning review order and an order appointing a guardian for a child because the court did not hold a proper hearing inasmuch as it failed to make the required findings of fact, did not first determine that
                            the father was unfit, acted inconsistently with his constitutionally protected parental status, or was otherwise unfit to serve as a parent to the child, and the father was not afforded the opportunity to raise an objection
                            on constitutional grounds at the permanency planning review hearing. In re R.P., <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 798 S.E.2d 428 (2017).

                            Trial court erred by establishing a guardianship for the child without considering and making written findings regarding whether it is possible for the juvenile to be placed with a parent within the next six months and, if not, why such placement is not

                            Appropriate Visitation Plan - Trial court erred in failing to provide for visitation between the mother and the mother's older two children who were placed with the father due to the mother's neglect; the trial court was required by statute to provide
                            for appropriate visitation as would be in the best interests of the minor children, consistent with their health and safety, and the trial court's failure to so provide meant the trial court had to consider the issue of visitation

                            Evidence of strong emotional bonding between father and child is critically important. It is not, however, determinative. It is but one factor which the trial court must consider in determining what is in the best interest of the child. In re Shue,

                            custody is restored to that parent, the trial court also must find that such placement is deemed to be in the best interest of the child. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>, 319

                            It is clear from the statutory framework of the Juvenile Code that one of the essential aims, if not the essential aim, of the dispositional hearing and the review hearing is to reunite the parent(s) and the child after the child has been taken from the

                            such placement is deemed in the best interest of the child. In re Isenhour, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 400 S.E.2d 71 (1991).

                            Nothing in the North Carolina Juvenile Code precluded the trial court from specifying in its order that the County Department of Social Services (DSS) "may" cease reconciliation efforts to reunite the juvenile with his mother while DSS was pursuing efforts
                            to terminate the mother's parental rights. In re Brake, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 339</cite>, 493 S.E.2d 418 (1997).

                            Removal from one parent to another parent, simply put, does not fit neatly into the language in the first paragraph of former G.S. 7A-657. Consequently, the court must stress the significance of that portion of this section requiring the trial court to
                            enter an order continuing the placement under review or providing for a different placement as is deemed to be in the best interest of the child.

                            Trial court, which continued a neglect and dependency case seven times due to a crowded docket, three times due to the absence of parties, and four times due to the absence of attorneys, did not abuse its discretion when it continued the case due to an
                            attorney's medical needs and again due to a death in the mother's family, as these situations might have been considered extraordinary circumstances justifying a continuance. However, a new trial was required because the court

                            that an order be entered within 30 days of a hearing, (1) the department of social services and the child's parents, who sought to appeal the order, were prejudiced, because they could not perfect their appeal; (2) the child
                            was prejudiced, because, while her permanency plan was reunification with her parents, nothing required her foster parents to cooperate with that plan, and, in fact, they sought termination of her parents' parental rights,

                            the trial court's findings were insufficient under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906(b)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>).

                            What Evidence Must Be Considered. - Whenever the trial court is determining the best interest of a child, any evidence which is competent and relevant to a showing of the best interest of that child must be heard and considered by the trial court, subject
                            to the discretionary powers of the trial court to exclude cumulative testimony. Without hearing and considering such evidence, the trial court cannot make an informed and intelligent decision concerning the best interest of
                            the child. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 567 (1984).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to have custody restored, former G.S. 7A-657 requires the mother to show only that child will receive proper care and supervision and that such placement is deemed to be in the best interest of the child. Consequently, evidence of the mother's
                            own changed circumstances and evidence that the child's welfare is being adversely affected by the child's present environment are both factors in the equation. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>,

         Testimony Properly Considered.
        </b> - Because the trial court was statutorily required to hear testimony from the foster parents and any person who would aid in its review, its decision to permit the foster parents and their counsel to participate
                            in the permanency planning proceedings was not manifestly unsupported by reason; the trial court did not allow the foster parents to intervene as parties but permitted their counsel to facilitate their testimony on direct examination,
                            which was information it was required to hear. In re J.L., - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 258 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Burden on Parents and Department. - The language of former G.S. 7A-640 and 7A-657 does not place any burden of proof upon either the parent(s) or department of social services during the dispositional hearing or the review hearing. The essential requirement,
                            at the dispositional hearing and the review hearing, is that sufficient evidence be presented to the trial court so that it can determine what is in the best interest of the child. In re Shue,

                            Trial court's denial of a mother's request to regain legal and physical custody of her minor child, who was in the legal custody of the county department of social services and under the guardianship of the child's grandparents, was reversed and remanded
                            because while the court held multiple proceedings pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906</a></cite>, there was never a finding made that guardianship was
                            the permanent plan under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>); therefore,

                            Trial court made the findings required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>),

                            because it did not address the goals of a child's foster care placement or the role her foster parents were to play in her future planning, because the foster parents were foster parents, as they were providing foster care,

                            Parent's Lack of Ability to Perform Mentally. - Evidence that mother was vulnerable to the influence of others and that she continued to live in a trailer that had the smell of kerosene, the problem that gave rise to the original removal of her minor
                            child from the home, supported a finding that the mother had a diminished capacity inhibiting her from making appropriate decisions for her child's care, which was sufficient in a review hearing under this section to evince
                            a lack of ability to perform mentally that impeded her child care decisions. In re Reinhardt, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 464 S.E.2d 698 (1995), overruled in part, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 339</cite>,

                            Contemplation of Custody With Whom Child Resides. - While a trial court had the authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>)

                            with someone other than a parent, the court erred in giving physical custody to the mother but ordering the child's "physical placement" to be with her maternal grandfather. G.S. 703(a) specified the dispositional alternatives
                            that were available in a custody matter, a "physical placement" with someone who did not have custody was not a permissible alternative under G.S. 703(a), and former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906ol1g" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906(g)</a></cite>                            contemplated that the person with whom the child was to live was a person who had custody of the child.

                            Although a trial court in a custody dispute ended the custody of a county department of social services, the court did not err in retaining jurisdiction to conduct period review hearings, despite a father's claim that the court, under
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906(d)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>), the court was relieved of the
                            duty to conduct such reviews after custody was awarded to the father; in deciding a custody case under G.S. 7A-657, the almost-identical predecessor to G.S. 7B-906, the state's supreme court had already ruled that the relevant
                            statutory language meant only that a trial court had a right to terminate its jurisdiction, but a trial court was not required to do so. Further, in the context of the Juvenile Code, North Carolina, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba02s7B-201" target="_self">G.S. 7B-201</a></cite>                            provided that once a court obtained jurisdiction over a juvenile, that jurisdiction continued until terminated by a court order or until the juvenile reached the age of 18 years or was otherwise emancipated, and the parties'
                            child was not yet 18 or emancipated. In re H.S.F., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 628 S.E.2d 416 (2006).

                            Trial Court Erred in Holding That There Would Be No Further Hearings. - Trial court erred in relieving all parties and attorneys of further responsibility and stating that there would be no further hearings held in the matter as the general rule under
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(a)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906</a></cite>.1) was that following a permanency
                            planning hearing, subsequent permanency planning hearings were to be held at least every six months thereafter, and that the hearings could be combined with review hearings under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906</a></cite>                            (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>); while the hearings could be dispensed with under certain circumstances, the trial court failed to find all the criteria

                            Evidence Supported Placement With Father. - Trial court did not err in placing one of the mother's three children in the custody of the child's father, where the court found that the father was the proper person to have custody and it was in the child's
                            best interest, and the evidence showed that the father was mentally sound and the child appeared well cared for, relaxed, and happy with the father; the mother's claim that more evidence was needed was insufficient to support
                            a finding of error. In re H.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 480, 677 S.E.2d 877 (2009).

                            Findings of Fact. - Remand was necessary where, although the trial court's findings of fact in a permanency planning review order were sufficient to support an order ceasing all efforts to reunify respondent with her children, the court failed to make
                            required findings of fact under the specific criteria provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>).

                            In a hearing held to determine if a mother was fit to retain custody of her child, the trial court's findings that the mother willfully and intentionally violated the court's orders to transfer all child support and social security payments she received
                            to a friend who had temporary custody of her child, and to stay a specified distance away from the friend, did not explain why it was not in child's best interests that he be returned to his mother, and because the trial court
                            did not make the findings required by subdivision (b)(1) of this section, the appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Buncombe County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Ledbetter
                            (In re Ledbetter), <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 580 S.E.2d 392 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's order which changed a mother's permanency planning order from reunification efforts with her two minor children to termination of her parental rights was based on findings of fact which were deemed insufficient to support the conclusions
                            of law, and accordingly, there was no compliance with the requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)</a></cite>, and the order was reversed; the
                            trial court failed to make specific factual findings that efforts towards reunification with the mother would be futile or that such efforts were inconsistent with the children's health, safety, and need for a permanent home,
                            and the findings listed were actually conclusions of law. In re Weiler, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 581 S.E.2d 134 (2003).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though the trial court did not specifically identify the various statutory factors it considered in authorizing a change in permanency planning from reunification to adoption, it was clear from the record that all of them had been taken into account;
                            moreover, since there was competent evidence in the record to support the conclusion that adoption was in the best interest of the children (where one child had become pregnant while staying in the parental home and the other
                            expressed a longing to be adopted by the foster parents), the appeals court would not disturb the order. In re J.C.S., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 595 S.E.2d 155 (2004).

                            In a case involving <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(a)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(c)</a></cite> (repealed, see now

                            of the children were paramount, and the trial court had no assurances the mother had made sufficient progress for the children to be returned to the mother's care. In re T.K., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 35,

                            in support of its order modifying a permanent plan from termination to guardianship and granting guardianship to a child's foster parents was supported by sufficient evidence that there were risks associated with the child
                            returning home, that earlier attempts at home placement had failed, and that the mother had failed even to contact the social worker associated with her case since the last review.

                            in support of its order modifying a permanent plan from termination to guardianship and granting guardianship to a child's foster parents was supported by sufficient evidence based on the length of time that the child had waited
                            for permanence and the other findings of fact. In re R.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 641 S.E.2d 404 (2007).

                            Trial court's finding that the foster parents understood the legal significance of the appointment of guardianship and that they had adequate resources to care appropriately for a child in support of its order modifying a permanent plan from termination
                            to guardianship and granting guardianship to the foster parents under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>)
                            was supported by sufficient evidence that the foster parents had been raising the child for six years. In re R.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 641 S.E.2d 404 (2007).

                            that the best plan of care to achieve a safe, permanent home for a child was to grant legal guardianship to the foster parents was a conclusion of law, but it was supported by the findings of fact; its mislabeling was inconsequential.
                            In re R.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 641 S.E.2d 404 (2007).

                            of a permanent plan from termination to guardianship and a grant of guardianship to a child's foster parents that the child's lack of permanence was resulting in developmental disabilities and that that situation continued
                            was based on competent evidence as the trial court did not err in taking judicial notice of a pre-adoption review order that stated that the child's emotional health had continued to deteriorate, and that permanency for the
                            child was not being achieved in a timely matter; at the time of the finding, it was clear that permanency had not been achieved. In re R.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 641 S.E.2d 404 (2007).

                            Permanency plan placing a juvenile with her paternal grandparents was upheld on appeal where the trial court's findings as to the mother's failure to undergo an ordered a psychological evaluation, her failure to conquer her anger problems, the mother's
                            placement of her boyfriend, who was a sexual offender, above the child, and the child's lack of interest in visiting with the mother met the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)</a></cite>                            (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in entering a permanency planning order as: (1) no findings were made as to the best plan of care for the children as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(c)</a></cite>                            (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>); (2) although there was a finding that there were no barriers to the children's adoption, there was not finding as to
                            whether adoption should be pursued as required by former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b3" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)(3)</a></cite>; (3) there was no finding as to whether the children should remain in the
                            current placement or be placed in another permanent living arrangement and why as required by former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)(4)</a></cite>; and (4) the only report specifically
                            discussing the children submitted for the permanency planning hearing was the guardian ad litem's report, and it was not incorporated in the findings of fact. In re Z.J.T.B., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 380,
                            645 S.E.2d 206 (2007).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Order ceasing reunification efforts contained the findings required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>);
                            among other things, the mother failed to attend all the meetings required by the substance abuse program, failed to continue individual therapy sessions, failed to safe secure housing and income, and had unprotected sex resulting
                            in numerous unplanned pregnancies that strained the mother's already limited resources, including the time and money she could devote to caring for the child. In re K.S, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 315, 646 S.E.2d
                            541 (2007).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Granting of guardianship to the child's maternal grandparents was supported by the trial court's findings that the mother was not employed, did not have stable housing, and refused to participate in individual counseling. In re T.R.M.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 773, 656 S.E.2d 626 (2008).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not fail to make sufficient findings of fact under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>)
                            because it considered the stability of a minor child's home life, her ability to interact with her siblings and mother, and her desire to remain in her current living situation with the aunt and uncle; the findings sufficiently
                            supported and explained the basis for the trial court's determination that placement with the father within the next six months would not be in the child's best interest, and the child had to be placed in another permanent
                            living arrangement. In re B.G., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 677 S.E.2d 549 (2009), dismissed 701 S.E.2d 324, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2020 (N.C. Ct. App. 2010).

                            Although there was sufficient evidence in the record to support proper findings regarding a trial court's decision to cease reunification efforts between a mother and child, the actual findings made by the trial court were insufficient because the trial
                            court entered one order that pertained to two parents in very different situations, it did not clearly delineate which findings applied to each parent, and while the record showed that the trial court meant to cease reunification
                            efforts only with regard to the mother, that was not clear in the findings themselves. In re H.J.A., <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 735 S.E.2d 359 (2012).

                            Failure to Make Required Findings of Fact. - Trial court erred in entering a permanency order relieving an agency from reunification efforts between a father and his children; the court failed to make required findings of fact pursuant to
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>),
                            and the evidence did not show that reunification was futile. In re Everett, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 588 S.E.2d 579 (2003).

                            because the issue of the child's possible placement with her paternal grandmother was relevant and not addressed in the order. In re M.R.D.C., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 603 S.E.2d 890 (2004), cert. denied,

                            on the rights and responsibilities that would remain with the mother after a guardianship was granted to a child's foster parents; the trial court also erred in stating orally at the hearing that visitation would be up to the
                            guardian as the awarding of visitation was a judicial function that could not be delegated to the child's custodian. In re R.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 641 S.E.2d 404 (2007).

                            Trial court's judgment regarding the custody disposition of the son, to the effect that the grandmother should have legal and physical custody of the son, could not stand because it lacked certain requisite findings. Pursuant to

                            placement, the findings needed to be made so that the appellate court could review a determination about whether the placement of the son with a relative was in the child's best interests. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite>                            497, 677 S.E.2d 532 (2009).

                            Permanency planning order was vacated and the matter was remanded to the trial court for the entry of a new permanency planning order containing adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law because the trial court's findings of fact simply did not
                            address the issues posited in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(b)</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>).
                            Although the trial court found that it was not in the best interests of the child to be returned home at the time of the hearing, it made no such findings about whether the child could be returned home within the next six months.

                            Trial court's order transferring jurisdiction to Michigan, ending review hearings, and not returning custody to the parents was reversed and the matter was remanded because the court failed to make necessary statutory findings to support its decision
                            and failed to set out an adequate visitation schedule. In re M.M., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 225, 750 S.E.2d 50 (2013).

                            Failure to Make Necessary Determinations. - Trial court failed to determine whether the department of social services had made reasonable efforts to reunite the child with the father, whether reunification would have been futile, or why placement with
                            the father was not in the child's best interest, in any manner other than the issuance of conclusory statements. In re A.E.C., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 768 S.E.2d 166 (2015).

                            Insufficient Evidence to Terminate Reunification Efforts. - Trial court erred when it ceased reunification efforts and awarded guardianship of a child to the child's foster parents because the evidence and the findings failed to support the trial court's
                            conclusion that reunification efforts with one of the child's parents would have been futile or would have been inconsistent with the child's health, safety, and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable period of
                            time. In re I.K., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 264, 742 S.E.2d 588 (2013).

                            Burden of proof. - Trial court's denial of a mother's request to regain legal and physical custody of her minor child, who was in the legal custody of the county department of social services and under the guardianship of the child's grandparents, was
                            reversed and remanded because while the court held multiple proceedings pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>),
                            there was never a finding made that guardianship was the permanent plan under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>);
                            therefore, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-600ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-600(b)</a></cite> was inapplicable, and the trial court erred by imposing the burden of proof upon the mother.

                            Failure to Timely File Termination Petition Did Not Prejudice the Mother. - Although the Department of Social Services' failure to file its termination petition with 60 days violated <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(e)</a></cite>                            (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>), the mother was not prejudiced; the mother failed to attend the termination hearing and did not assert that she would
                            have attended hearing if the petition had been timely filed. In re As.L.G., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 551, 619 S.E.2d 561 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Trial court was not divested of subject matter jurisdiction over a termination of parental rights matter, even though the petition was not timely filed under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907</a></cite>,
                            since a mother failed to present any argument as to how the delay prejudiced her or any other party to the matter. In re W.L.M., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 640 S.E.2d 439 (2007).

                            The trial court's Permanency Planning order was reversed where it neither directed DSS to initiate termination of parental rights proceedings against respondent mother nor made findings as permitted by subdivisions (d)(1) to (d)(3). In re Dula,
                            <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 544 S.E.2d 591 (2001), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 356</cite>, 554 S.E.2d 336 (2001).

                            Where a natural father, as a potential candidate for custody, was dismissed because of his late appearance, the trial court should have considered whether the father was a candidate for custody of a minor child and should have had required interviews
                            by the guardian ad litem and Department of Social Services to further investigate the child's placement with her other natural parent. In re Eckard, <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. App.</cite> 541,

                            Award of Custody to Great-grandmother. - Termination of aunt's parental rights and award of permanent custody to the child's maternal great-grandmother was supported by substantial, competent evidence and affirmed, even though they had a pending G.S.
                            ch. 50 custody action, where evidence at the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>)
                            hearing indicated that the child's aunt, who had been awarded temporary custody, failed to: (1) comply with court orders, including drug testing; (2) make reasonable and timely progress towards permanency, including providing
                            suitable living conditions; (3) prove that it was possible for the child to return to her home within six months; and (4) prove it was in the child's best interests to live with her. In re C.E.L., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite>                            468, 615 S.E.2d 427 (2005).

                            Although it would be better practice to use the words of the statute, the trial court's use of the word "improbable" when concluding that the child's return to the mother was not "possible" did not require remand. In re T.R.M.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 773, 656 S.E.2d 626 (2008).

                            Trial court did not err by awarding joint legal custody to a child's father and her maternal aunt and uncle under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(f)</a></cite> (repealed, see now

                            Court erred in ordering an infant placed in guardianship because homelessness and joblessness did not per se support an abuse or neglect finding; but the court committed no error in admitting social services and guardian ad litem reports or alleged hearsay
                            where the objection to the hearsay was unpreserved. In re Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 576 S.E.2d 386 (2003).

                            not a final order; since the trial court also had a continuing <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907</a></cite> (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>)

                            of delay, as the mother did not take advantage of visitation and did not have contact with the petitioning agency, and the mother, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1001" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1001</a></cite>,

                            the mother was not entitled to relief, as the mother made no attempt to demonstrate the prejudice required for reversal. In re C.L.C., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 615 S.E.2d 704 (2005), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 475</cite>,

                            Notice Requirements. - Trial court erred in authorizing a permanent plan for a child at the disposition hearing on a dependency petition, seemingly without the required statutory notice to respondent. On remand, the trial court was required to provide
                            the statutory notice. In the Matter of S.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 718 S.E.2d 709 (2011).

                            Parents waived their right to notice of the trial court's intent to enter a permanent plan since they did not object to the entry of a permanent plan at disposition. In re J.P., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 537,

                            Trial court did not err in adopting a permanent plan as to a mother's children because (1) the mother knew the court intended to adopt such a plan, and (2) the mother waived more formal notice by actively participating in proceedings concerning the plan.

                            Parents' claim that the trial court erred by adopting a permanent plan for the mother's two children at the disposition hearing without the notice required by former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(a)</a></cite>                            (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>) was rejected because any error was harmless given the trial court's adoption of a permanent plan at disposition; the parents did
                            not object to the permanent plan. In re J.P., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 750 S.E.2d 543 (2013).

                            Trial court did not err by entering a permanent plan for a mother's two children because she waived her right to notice by participating in the dispositional hearing and failing to object to the lack of notice, and reunification efforts would be inconsistent
                            with the children's health, safety, and need for a permanent home. In re T.H., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 753 S.E.2d 207 (2014).

                            Appeals. - Appellate court dismissed a mother's appeal from the trial court's order which found that her child was neglected and set adoption as the permanent plan for the child because the appeal became moot when the trial court entered a subsequent
                            order terminating the mother's parental rights. In re V.L.B., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 743, 596 S.E.2d 896 (2004).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Allowing the mother to stay the termination proceedings pending an appeal of a custody review order would have precluded compliance with the termination timeline mandated under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907</a></cite>,
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109</a></cite>, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>, and this would have been improper. In re R.T.W.,

                            Trial court's finding that a maternal aunt and uncle had adequate resources to support a minor child was treated as conclusive and was sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(f)</a></cite>                            (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>) because the father did not assign as error the trial court's findings of fact; therefore, the findings were deemed to
                            be supported by competent evidence and were conclusive on review. In re B.G., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 677 S.E.2d 549 (2009), dismissed 701 S.E.2d 324, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                            Trial court's order was reversed as to the portion granting secondary placement of the juveniles with the grandmother because the trial court's conclusions of law were not supported by the findings of fact; both the incorporated findings from the order
                            entered on March 12, 2008 and the trial court's additional findings of fact supported a conclusion that placement with the grandmother was not in the children's best interests. In re E.K.,

                        Amendment not Applicable. - Statutory amendment was not applicable in a dependency proceeding because, although the written permanency planning review (PPR) order was signed and filed after the effective date of the amendment, the PPR hearing was conducted
                        and concluded prior to the effective date, and the court's ruling that reunification efforts would be ceased and the child's permanent plan would be changed to custody with paternal cousins was announced in open court on that date.

        Section Not Applicable.
       </b> - Because termination of parental rights case was not a permanency planning hearing, this section did not apply. In re T.H., - N.C. App. - , 832 S.E.2d 162 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Multiple Plans Contemplated. - Statute clearly contemplates the use of multiple, concurrent plans including reunification and adoption, and during concurrent planning, the Department of Social Services is required to continue making reasonable reunification
                        efforts until reunification is eliminated as a permanent plan; under the framework of concurrent planning, the prior order here did not explicitly or implicitly eliminate reunification as a permanent plan, and thus the order failed
                        to meet the requirements for appeal. In re A.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 812 S.E.2d 875 (2018).

        Notice of Change in Recommendations or Plan.
       </b> - Because the hearing was designated as a permanency planning hearing, mother was on notice that the trial court could change the permanent plan for the juveniles and that she needed to present all evidence relevant
                        to her arguments concerning proper; although mother argued that notice of a change in recommendations be given in advance of the hearing, such notice is not required by the chapter and mother's due process rights were not violated.

                    <p>
                        Reunification. - Order contained no findings under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-901ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-901(c)</a></cite> as that subsection did not apply since the child was not placed in department of social
                        services custody; thus, when establishing permanent plans, the trial court was required to make reunification a primary or secondary plan and require reunification efforts unless it found they would be unsuccessful or inconsistent
                        with the child's health or safety, and it could make that finding even though it was the first hearing. In re H.L., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 807 S.E.2d 685 (2017).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's findings of fact were not sufficient to support the court's conclusion that reunification efforts should have ceased since the evidence contained in the agency and guardian ad litem reports, while indicating concern with the parents' extensive
                        substance abuse history and the sustainability of recent improvements, did not support the finding, and the findings provided little indication as to what clear and convincing evidence the court found persuasive in reaching the
                        court's conclusion. In re I.K., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 818 S.E.2d 359 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Findings that efforts to reunify a mother and child should cease were sufficient because (1) the findings were not contradictory, (2) the mother acted in a manner inconsistent with the child's health or safety, and (3) the findings addressed the substance
                        of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.2ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.2(b)</a></cite>. In re M.T.-L.Y., - N.C. App. - , 829 S.E.2d 496 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Termination of parental rights and permanency plan orders were vacated because the orders did not comply with recent precedent requiring that an initial permanency plan order contain a plan for reunification. In re M.T.-L.Y., - N.C. App. - , 829 S.E.2d
                        496 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Ceasing reunification efforts was not error where an assigned social worker's testimony that the mother attempted but had not been able to show that she could obtain and maintain information or parent the children in a safe environment supported the findings,
                        notwithstanding any evidence to the contrary. Even though a finding that the county social services department did not have a release for the mother's mental health records was erroneous, it did not impact the ultimate determination.

                    <p>
                        Even if the trial court had not used the precise language of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.2ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.2(b)</a></cite>, that was not fatal as the trial court's findings addressed the health, safety,
                        and welfare of the children. In re C.M., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Sept. 15, 2020).

                    <p>
                        Under subsection (a1), reunification efforts may be ceased simply upon completion of one of the juvenile's permanent plans, and consequently, that completion of a permanent plan means that no specific factual findings are required under subsection (b).

                    <p>
                        No evidence showed mother abusing medications, having mental health breakdowns, or being involved in unhealthy relationships for three years after child was removed from her care, her limited communications and visits with the child were described as
                        appropriate, and she maintained stable employment and housing; finding reunification efforts would be unsuccessful or inconsistent with child's health was unsupported by clear evidence and did not meet the mandatory requirements
                        of the statute. In re J.C.-b., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 16, 2021).

                    <p>
                        Nothing indicates concrete action steps or that timelines were established from contacts, reviews, and assessments to reunify child with mother, department made no diligent or substantial efforts towards reunification in the more than 10 months between
                        court's decision in in March 2019 and the hearing in January 2020, and the statutorily required efforts were arguably non-existent. In re J.C.-b., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 16, 2021).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neither the trial court's order nor the department's evaluation provided evidence to support findings specifically addressing the statutory factors; trial court found that the child's therapist felt the child needed to remain with grandmother, that the
                        mother was taking medications for mood and anxiety, and that the mother did not file a report of her counseling or provide a signed release to her counselors, but these findings were inadequate to support the conclusion that reunification
                        efforts should cease. In re J.C.-b., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 16, 2021).

                        Court failed to make required findings of fact because, while the record contained little evidence presented by the parties on the issue of the mother's availability, the written report to the trial court for the permanency planning hearing included information
                        about the mother's attendance at court dates and scheduled visitations, as well as her failure to attend child and family team meetings; the information contained in the reports did not satisfy the trial court's statutory obligation.

                        efforts would be unsuccessful or inconsistent with the children's health, safety, and need for a permanent home was contradictory to all evidence presented to the trial court. In re J.M., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 6, 2021).

                        Trial court's order ceasing reunification efforts and excluding reunification of a mother with the mother's children as a permanent plan was not an abuse of discretion because the evidence supported the court's finding that the mother only made some progress
                        with respect to the mother's parenting skills. Moreover, the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that ceasing reunification was in the best interests of the children. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 264</cite>,
                        837 S.E.2d 847 (2020).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Requirements Met. - Trial court complied with its obligations under the statue because it set a primary and secondary plan and determined that no further reunification efforts were required; the trial court's findings, which were supported by testimony
                        and evidence introduced at the hearing, demonstrated that the father completely failed to comply with his case plan while the child was in a safety placement with her sister. In re H.L., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite>                        450, 807 S.E.2d 685 (2017).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the trial court's award of custody to the legal father achieved the children's permanent plan in accordance with subsection (a1), the trial court's order satisfied the second prong of subsection (b);because of the disjunctive phrasing of subsection
                        2(b), the satisfaction of this single prong is sufficient to meet the requirements of the statute as a whole. In re E.Y.B., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 16, 2021).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's order encompassed all required findings under subsection (d)(1)-(4) because competent evidence supported the finding that a biological father had not made adequate progress towards his case plan's anticipated goals; competent evidence supported
                        the finding that the biological father's behavior was inconsistent with the health and safety of the children, given his lack of stable and appropriate housing, his active probation orders, and his history of criminal activity.
                        In re E.Y.B., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 16, 2021).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Requirements Not Met. - Trial court's unsupported conclusory statement that reasonable efforts to reunify the family would have been futile and inconsistent with the children's health or safety did not meet the requirements in this section and case law.

                        The purpose of each placement review is to ensure that every reasonable effort is being made to provide for permanent placement plans for the juvenile who has been placed in the custody of a county director or licensed child-placing agency, which are
                        consistent with the juvenile's best interests. At each review hearing the court may consider information from the department of social services, the licensed child-placing agency, the guardian ad litem, the child, the person providing
                        care for the child, and any other person or agency the court determines is likely to aid in the review. The court may consider any evidence, including hearsay evidence as defined in G.S. 8C-1, Rule 801, that the court finds to
                        be relevant, reliable, and necessary to determine the needs of the juvenile and the most appropriate disposition.

                        bring an action seeking custody of minor child placed in their home by defendant. Oxendine v. Department of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 370 (1981); In re Scearce,

                        But Foster Parents Have Right to Be Heard. - At the very least, foster parents have the right for an opportunity to be heard, a right which derives from the child's right to have his or her best interests protected. In re Scearce,

                        Intervention by Foster Parents in Custody Proceeding. - In a proceeding brought by DSS, in which custody was put in issue by guardian ad litem and natural father, trial court did not err in permitting child's foster parents to intervene. In re Scearce,

                        Power of Court to Award Custody to Foster Parents. - Having acquired subject matter jurisdiction, trial court, guided by the best interests of the child, had broad dispositional powers, including the power to award legal custody of child to its foster
                        parents. In re Scearce, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 345 S.E.2d 404, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 415</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 589 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Responsibility of Guardian ad Litem in Adoption Process. - The legislature charged the county department of social services or other licensed child-placing agency with the responsibility of selecting adoptive parents. The guardian ad litem's responsibility
                        during this process is to raise any issue of the agency's abuse of discretion within ten days after she receives written notice of the filing of the adoption petition. The legislature provided no other responsibility for the guardian
                        ad litem once a petition for adoption is filed and none seems appropriate. In re James S., <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 357 S.E.2d 430 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under G.S. 48-16(a), the legislature clearly vested the Department of Social Services with the duty and responsibility to make investigations regarding adoptions. Thus, absent any responsibilities or duties to perform, the guardian ad litem is superfluous
                        to an adoption proceeding. In re James S., <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 357 S.E.2d 430 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The guardian ad litem is empowered under former G.S. 7A-659(f) (see now this section) to request information about and be consulted concerning the adoption selection process. This includes confidential adoption information regarding adoptive parents.
                        In re N.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 365 S.E.2d 213, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 481</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 226 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was the duty and right of guardian ad litem to inquire into Department of Social Services' handling of child's adoption, and it was within the district court's jurisdiction to order DSS to turn over requested information, despite its confidential nature.
                        In re N.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 365 S.E.2d 213, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 481</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 226 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Guardian ad litem's responsibility to child is intact for the 10-day period after he receives written notice of filing of adoption petition for the purpose of raising any issue of abuse of discretion. In re N.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                        79, 365 S.E.2d 213, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 481</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 226 (1988).

                        Guardian ad litem who first made a motion to the court for information five days before receiving written notice that an adoption petition had been filed still had a responsibility and a duty, pursuant to former G.S. 7A-659(f) (see now this section),
                        at the time he received notice of the adoption petition to raise any issue of abuse of discretion. In re N.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 365 S.E.2d 213, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 481</cite>,

                        District Court Jurisdiction Not Ended by Notice of Adoption Petition. - District court jurisdiction attached on March 25, 1987, when guardian ad litem filed a motion in district court to compel Department of Social Services (DSS) to grant his requests
                        to visit child and to obtain information on any prospective adoptive parents, and subsequent notice received on March 31, 1987, to the effect that a petition for adoption had been filed, did not end the district court's jurisdiction.

                        clerk of superior court within the 10-day period provided for in former G.S. 7A-659(f) (see now this section). In re N.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 365 S.E.2d 213, cert. denied,

                        is in abeyance once the petition is filed. Only when an adoption petition is withdrawn or dismissed does the district court recommence its supervision. In re James S., <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 357 S.E.2d 430

                    <p>
                        Retention of Jurisdiction. - Court did not fail to find if the court should retain jurisdiction because (1) the court did not terminate jurisdiction and said the parties could ask the court to review visitation, (2) a mother did not claim the court wrongly
                        kept jurisdiction or did not follow statutory procedures, and (3) the mother did not support a claim that transfer to an N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 50 proceeding was not analyzed. In re Y.I., <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite>                        575, 822 S.E.2d 501 (2018).

        Subject Matter Jurisdiction.
       </b> - Trial court did not err in asserting jurisdiction over a child custody action after a juvenile proceeding was terminated because the court had subject-matter jurisdiction to consider the father's custody claim once
                        he invoked jurisdiction by filing a motion; the juvenile order terminated the jurisdiction of the juvenile court over the child and, thus, the legal status of the juvenile and the custodial rights of the parties reverted to the
                        status they were before the juvenile petition was filed. McMillan v. McMillan, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 692 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Proper Entry of Order. - There was no requirement that the trial court enter two different orders in a neglect action; the trial court could enter one order for placement in both the juvenile file and the civil file as long as the order was sufficient
                        to support termination of juvenile court jurisdiction and modification of custody. In re A.S., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 139, 641 S.E.2d 400 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's order stating that it resolved any pending claim for custody complied with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-911" target="_self">G.S. 7B-911</a></cite> because it contained findings of fact which were relevant
                        to the issue of the child's best interest and welfare, and contained findings which established that the mother failed to seek medical attention for the child, yet the father took appropriate action. In re T.H.T., <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite>                        337, 648 S.E.2d 519 (2007), aff'd in part, modified in part, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 446</cite>, 665 S.E.2d 54 (2008).

                        Trial court, in a custody case involving the son where reunification with a parent was the original goal and the county social services agency had obtained legal custody of him while awaiting a permanent disposition, did not enter a proper civil child-custody
                        order pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-911" target="_self">G.S. 7B-911</a></cite>. It made no findings of fact regarding its decision to transfer the son's juvenile case pursuant to "Chapter
                        50," <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.1" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.1</a></cite>, and to terminate its jurisdiction. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 677 S.E.2d 532

                    <p>
                        Trial court's order contained findings of fact relevant to the issue of a child's interest and welfare because the trial court specifically made findings establishing that the mother tested positive for drugs, that she showed up late for visits, that
                        her behavior was erratic during visits, that the father tested negative for drugs, that his residence was appropriate for the child, and that it was in the best interest of the child to award custody to father. In re J.D.R.,

                        <b>
        Modification of Custody Order.
       </b> - Trial court did not err in granting a mother legal and primary physical custody because the court was permitted to make an initial child custody determination since the juvenile court in the neglect proceeding returned
                        custody to the parties; in the absence of an existing permanent child custody order, the trial court was not required to find or conclude that there existed a substantial change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the child
                        for purposes of modifying an existing custody order. McMillan v. McMillan, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 692 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Termination of Parental Rights. - Mother's parental rights to three children were properly terminated under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite> because the children had
                        been in an out-of home-placement since March 2008 neglect proceedings, and the court's order converting the neglect case into a civil custody case, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-911" target="_self">G.S. 7B-911</a></cite>,
                        qualified as a "court order" under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>; the children were placed with the paternal grandparents after the neglect proceedings and, after a permanency
                        planning review in September 2008, the grandparents were awarded legal and physical custody. In re L.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 739 S.E.2d 596 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Trial Court Failed to Make Required Findings. - Because the trial court did not make the required findings that there was no need for continued State intervention on behalf of the child, it erred in terminating its jurisdiction over the child by transferring
                        the issue of the child's custody to a North Carolina General Statutes <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50</a></cite> case; the disposition order contained no
                        findings from which the court of appeals could infer that the trial court considered the extent to which continued State intervention was necessary. In re J.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 768 S.E.2d 172 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Order granting the father custody of a child who was the subject of a juvenile petition was reversed because (1) the court intended to terminate juvenile court jurisdiction but six months had not passed since the court held the child's permanent plan
                        was placing the child with the father, and (2) a finding that this period had passed was required since the child did not live with the father when the juvenile petition was filed. In re J.K., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 4,
                        2017).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in terminating the juvenile proceeding and initiating a civil action because it made no findings satisfying either subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), and the findings it did make did not allow the court of appeals to infer that those statutory
                        provisions were met. In re J.D.M.-J., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 56, 817 S.E.2d 755 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reversal and remand of a trial court's disposition orders and civil custody order was appropriate, and the trial court was instructed to hold a new hearing and enter orders with findings of facts supported by competent evidence that supported its conclusions
                        of law, because, based upon the evidence, there was no factual support for a conclusion that a mother was unfit to have custody of the mother's children. In re B.C.T., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite>                        176, 828 S.E.2d 50 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the juvenile was already the subject of a custody order, the trial court was required to enter an order with findings and conclusions that supported modification of that order, yet no findings or conclusions were made, plus the trial court failed
                        to find that there was not a need for continued State intervention, and remand was required. In re S.M.L., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 21, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appellate Court Lacked Jurisdiction. - Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to hear a mother's claim of an alleged violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-911ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-911(c)</a></cite> as the mother
                        failed to appeal a civil custody order, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-911ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-911(c)</a></cite> applied to civil custody orders, but not to review orders; without proper notice of appeal, the
                        appellate court did not acquire jurisdiction, and neither the court nor the parties could waive the jurisdictional requirements even for good cause shown under N.C. R. App. P. 2. In re H.S.F., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                        739, 645 S.E.2d 383 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Appellate court lacked jurisdiction because the lower court failed to comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-911" target="_self">G.S. 7B-911</a></cite> in terminating the jurisdiction of the juvenile court in a purported
                        transfer of a case from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, as an abuse/neglect/dependency proceeding under G.S. ch. 7B, to a civil action between private parties under G.S. ch. 50; upon remand, the case remained within the
                        jurisdiction of the juvenile court unless and until it terminated its jurisdiction in compliance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-911" target="_self">G.S. 7B-911</a></cite> and entered a civil custody order in compliance

                        Applicability. - Mother's argument that a permanency plan failed to comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1000ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1000(a)</a></cite> was rejected where the permanency planning order stated

In re J.S., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 370, 792 S.E.2d 861 (2016).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finding of Changed Conditions Required. - It is fundamental that before an order may be entered modifying a custody decree, there must be a finding of fact of changed conditions. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                        53, 334 S.E.2d 428, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 194</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 584 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A decree of custody is entitled to such stability as would end the vicious litigation so often accompanying such contests, unless it be found that some change of circumstances has occurred affecting the welfare of the child so as to require modification
                        of the order. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 334 S.E.2d 428, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 194</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 584 (1986).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For case in which the court found no change in the needs of juvenile requiring that her custody be returned to her parents, see In re Botsford, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 72, 330 S.E.2d 23 (1985).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence of prior neglect which led to an adjudication of neglect shows circumstances as they were and therefore is relevant to whether a change of circumstances has occurred since the court's order. In re Brenner, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite>                        242, 350 S.E.2d 140 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Modification Upheld. - Where court had previously deemed it in the best interest of minor children who had been adjudicated neglected that mother comply with certain orders of the court, the court acted with full statutory authority when it later conducted
                        a hearing upon social worker's subsequent motion and determined that mother's refusal to cooperate with community-level services and orders applicable to her constituted a "change of circumstances" affecting the best interest of
                        the children, sufficient to require modification of prior custody orders. In re Brenner, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 350 S.E.2d 140 (1986).

                        Guardian Ad Litem Not "Proper Party." - Guardian ad litem for parents in a termination of parental rights action was not designated as a "proper party" who could give notice of appeal pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1001" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1001</a></cite>.
                        In re L.B., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 326, 653 S.E.2d 240 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 507</cite>, 666 S.E.2d 751 (2008).

                        Although a permanency planning order did not satisfy the statutory requirements, considering the order in conjunction with the termination of parental rights order satisfied the requirements because the two orders together embraced the substance of the
                        statutory provisions requiring findings of fact that further reunification efforts would have been futile or would have been inconsistent with a juvenile's health, safety, and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable
                        period of time. In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 763 S.E.2d 314 (2014).

                        Mother Had Standing to Bring Appeal. - Although a mother was not served with the juvenile petition, as the child's parent, she was a proper party to appeal the adjudication and disposition order. In re E.J., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite>                        333, 738 S.E.2d 204 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Mother's failure to appeal an initial dispositional order did not deprive the mother of standing to appeal a subsequent dispositional order placing the mother's child in foster care because the mother had no occasion to appeal the initial order which
                        awarded custody of the child to the mother. In re E.G.M., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 196, 750 S.E.2d 857 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mother had standing to appeal a permanency planning order awarding guardianship of a child to foster parents because the statutory requirements were satisfied since the trial court's permanency planning order changed legal custody of the child from county
                        department of social services to the foster parents, and the mother was the child's parent who was a "nonprevailing party"; the mother asserted her own parental interest in having the child placed in a foster home with is half-siblings.

                    <p>
                        Mother Did Not Have Standing to Bring Appeal. - Mother had no standing to appeal orders entered concerning children as to whom the mother's parental rights were previously terminated because the mother did not come within any category of persons afforded
                        a statutory right to appeal from a juvenile matter pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1001" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1001</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1002" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1002</a></cite>,
                        as (1) the mother's parental rights had been terminated, (2) the mother was not appointed as the children's guardian upon the death of the children's adoptive parent, and (3) nothing showed the mother had custody of the children
                        following the adoptive parent's death. In re T.H., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 5, 2013).

                    <p>
                        Mother lacked standing to appeal the trial court's dependency and placement orders because she did not come within any category of persons afforded a statutory right to appeal from a juvenile matter. In re T.H., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite>                        16, 753 S.E.2d 207 (2014).

                        Mother was not entitled to relief from the parental rights termination where the termination petitions were filed more than three months after the limitations period under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(e)</a></cite>                        (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>), which was directory rather than mandatory, had run; the mother failed to show that she was prejudiced by the period of delay,
                        as the mother did not take advantage of visitation and did not have contact with the petitioning agency, and the mother, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1001" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1001</a></cite>, could have
                        appealed from either the review hearing ceasing efforts to reunify the family or from the permanency planning order that changed the permanency plan to termination of parental rights. In re C.L.C., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite>                        438, 615 S.E.2d 704 (2005), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 475</cite>, 628 S.E.2d 760 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Trial court, by making a minor child's maternal aunt and uncle the guardians for the child, modified the child's custody from the county department of social services to the aunt and uncle, which allowed the child's father to appeal the permanency planning
                        order as to child pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1001ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1001(a)(4)</a></cite>. As a result, the appellate court had jurisdiction to consider the father's challenge
                        to the permanency planning order on the merits. In re J.V., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 108, 679 S.E.2d 843 (2009).
                    </p>

                        Trial court's order denying a guardian ad litem's motion for relief was appealable because the order determined that a county department of social service's voluntary dismissal of juvenile petitions was effective, thus depriving the trial court of jurisdiction,
                        and preventing a final judgment on the merits from which appeal might have been taken. In re E.H., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 525, 742 S.E.2d 844 (2013).

        Judicially Noticed Findings.
       </b> - Notwithstanding the trial court's authority to take notice of the court's own orders, it was problematic to allow the trial court's findings in the first order on nonsecure custody to serve as the sole support for
                        most findings in the neglect adjudication; the trial court was not bound by the rules of evidence at the custody hearing and respondents had no right to appeal, and to allow the trial court to find adjudicatory facts by taking
                        judicial notice of the court's prior findings undermined the procedural safeguards for adjudications. In re J.C.M.J.C., - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 670 (2019).

                        Saturday and Sunday was excluded from the three-day period; the last day on which respondent could have filed a timely notice of appeal was August 24, 2015, and because respondent did not file a notice of appeal until August 25,
                        2015, the notice of appeal was untimely and the appeal was treated as a petition for writ of certiorari. In re S.Z.H., <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 785 S.E.2d 341 (2016).

                        Because there was no final order terminating parental rights from which a parent could appeal until the trial court entered its disposition order, the parent timely filed a notice of appeal within thirty days after entry and service of the disposition
                        order-stating the parent's desire to appeal both the adjudication order and the disposition order. Therefore, the parent's appeal of both the adjudication order and the disposition order was properly before the appellate court.

                        which permitted appeal from any order finding absence of jurisdiction, as the trial court never ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction to decide DSS's motion. Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-506ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7B-506(d)</a></cite>,
                        7B-200(a), the trial court clearly had jurisdiction to enter a nonsecure custody order; and, assuming arguendo that the court erred in the scope of the court's order for board payments to foster parents, this did not necessarily
                        deprive the court of jurisdiction. In re A.T., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 662 S.E.2d 917 (2008).

                        Appeal of Order Changing Legal Custody of Child. - In a case in which the father appealed from the trial court's permanency planning order changing legal custody of his child, the trial court improperly entered a permanency planning order granting custody
                        of the child to the child's maternal grandparents as the trial court failed to adopt a permanent plan for the child as mandated by statute; thus, the appellate court reversed the trial court's permanency planning order awarding
                        custody of the child to the maternal grandparents and waiving further review hearings. In re D.A., <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 822 S.E.2d 664 (2018).

                        Review Order not Final. - In dependency proceedings, a trial court's order finding that an agency should pursue termination of a father's parental rights and adoption of the father's child by the child's foster parents, based on a finding that the child's
                        placement with the father was "unlikely" and that it was in the child's best interests for the agency to pursue termination, was not a final order subject to appeal under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1001" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1001(4)</a></cite>.

                        Appeals Dismissed But Petitions for Certiorari Allowed. - Court of appeals had to dismiss an appeal by a mother and father of an order terminating their parental rights because they did not sign the notices of appeal, and their amended notices of appeal,
                        which bore their signatures, were filed outside the 30-day deadline imposed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1001ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1001(b)</a></cite>; however, because the timely notices
                        of appeal, together with the amended notices of appeal, provided record evidence that the mother and father desired to pursue the appeal, understood the nature of the appeal, and cooperated with counsel in filing the notice of
                        appeal, the court of appeals exercised its discretion pursuant to N.C. R. App. P. 21(a)(1) and allowed the petitions for writ of certiorari the mother and father filed to permit consideration of their appeals on the merits so as
                        to avoid penalizing the mother and father for their attorneys' errors. In re I.T.P-L, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 670 S.E.2d 282 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 581</cite>, 681 S.E.2d 783

                        Although a parent's notice of appeal did not reference the civil custody order entered, the appellate court in its discretion granted the parent's petition for writ of certiorari and reviewed the civil custody order along with the disposition orders.

                        Mother had standing to appeal a permanency planning order awarding guardianship of a child to foster parents because the statutory requirements were satisfied since the trial court's permanency planning order changed legal custody of the child from county
                        department of social services to the foster parents, and the mother was the child's parent who was a "nonprevailing party"; the mother asserted her own parental interest in having the child placed in a foster home with is half-siblings.

                        Constitutionality of Former G.S. 7A-289. - Former G.S. 7A-289, permitting the district court to enter a temporary custody order affecting a juvenile who is appealing a commitment order of the court, was not unconstitutional on the ground that the statute
                        deprived the juvenile of the right to bail. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 176 S.E.2d 849 (1970), decided under former G.S. 7A-289.

                        Construction. - Because a county's department of social services (DSS) chose to file a petition to terminate parental rights, there were two actions relating to the child: the neglect proceeding and the termination of parental rights (TPR) proceeding.
                        DSS's claim that the trial court was free to act in the neglect proceeding while the TPR order was on appeal did not comport with the legislature's intent in enacting <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite>,
                        as revealed by the long-standing interpretation given to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite> and its predecessor versions, as well as the recent amendments.

                        Section Controls over G.S. 1-294. - Although <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-294" target="_blank">G.S. 1-294</a></cite> states the general rule regarding jurisdiction of the trial court pending
                        appeal, it is not controlling where there is a specific statute, such as former G.S. 7A-669 (see now this section), addressing the matter in question. In re Huber, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 291 S.E.2d 916,
                        appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 223 (1982).

                        When considering whether a trial court had jurisdiction to grant a motion to terminate parental rights that was filed during the pendency of an appeal from the trial court's dispositional order, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite>                        controlled over the general rule in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-294" target="_blank">G.S. 1-294</a></cite> because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite>                        was a specific statute that addressed the trial court's jurisdiction during the pendency of an appeal, under the Juvenile Code.

                        Section Permits Court to Circumvent Recalcitrant Parties. - Without authority of the district court to provide for the treatment of a neglected child pending appeal, a recalcitrant party could frustrate the efforts of the court to provide for the child's
                        best interests by simply entering notice of appeal. In re Huber, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 291 S.E.2d 916, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>,

                        Trial Court's Authority Pending Appeal. - Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper based on willful abandonment of her child as the mother made no effort to contact the child and paid nothing toward his support during the six months immediately
                        preceding the filing of the grandparents' petition to terminate because, while her parental rights had been previously terminated, there was no evidence that the mother sought to stay the order while her appeal was pending, or
                        otherwise requested visitation with the child from the trial court or the grandparents; she was not prohibited from contacting and visiting the child; and she demonstrated almost no interest in the child since losing custody of
                        him. In re D.E.M., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 401, 802 S.E.2d 766 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 463</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 567, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 55 (2018).

                        Father properly perfected his appeal, and with knowledge of that appeal, the trial court proceeded with a hearing for termination of the father's parental rights; thus, the trial court clearly acted beyond the limitations statutorily placed on its subject
                        matter jurisdiction; the trial court conducted the hearing on the motion to terminate while the disposition of the father's appeal from the remand orders was pending. In re J.M., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 23, 2021).

                        Emergency Commitment Held Improper. - Written order which merely stated that it was an "emergency commitment," without stating any supporting reasons or findings of fact, was not proper. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                        171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988), holding, however, that juvenile had not shown prejudice from such order.

                        Need to Protect Children Pending Appeals. - As to a trial court's authority to enter orders pending an appeal, the rule adopted by the General Assembly for abuse, neglect, and dependency proceedings (G.S. 7B-1003(b)(2)) is that the trial court may only
                        enter orders affecting the custody or placement of the juvenile as the court finds to be in the best interests of the juvenile; if the appeal arises out of a termination of parental rights petition, then under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003(c)</a></cite> the court may enter a temporary order affecting the custody or placement of the juvenile as the court finds to be in the best interests
                        of the juvenile. The language in both subsections limits the trial court's authority to the traditionally-recognized need to protect children pending appeals. In re K.L., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 674 S.E.2d
                        789 (2009).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plain language of the statute requires a holding that <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003(c)</a></cite> provides that if a termination of parental rights (TPR) order resulting from a petition
                        has been appealed, then the trial court has jurisdiction - in both the TPR action and the underlying abuse, neglect, and dependency action - only to enter a temporary order affecting the custody or placement of the juvenile as
                        the court finds to be in the best interests of the juvenile. In re K.L., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 674 S.E.2d 789 (2009).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Trial Court's Authority Pending Appeal. - In the context of the authority of a trial court pending an appeal, if a county's department of social services (DSS) files a motion in a cause to terminate parental rights, then
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003(b)</a></cite> applies, but if DSS files a petition, initiating a new action, then <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003(c)</a></cite>                        applies. In re K.L., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 674 S.E.2d 789 (2009).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Trial court lacked jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite> to enter an order terminating a father's parental rights while the father's appeal from the court's permanency
                        planning review order was pending before the Court of Appeals of North Carolina. In re Hopkins, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 38, 592 S.E.2d 22 (2004), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 632</cite>, 616 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Trial Court Improperly Failed to Comply with Appellate Mandate. - Termination order was improper under circumstances in which the trial court proceeded with the termination hearing before complying with the appellate mandate vacating permanency planning
                        order, which changed the permanent plan from reunification to termination; the legislature did not intend for its amendment of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite>                        to divest trial courts of jurisdiction over termination petitions during appeals of dispositional orders, but to nonetheless allow trial courts to avoid the effect of those appeals once they were decided. Garrison v. R.V.P. (In
                        re P.P.), <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 423, 645 S.E.2d 398 (2007).

                    <p>
                        This section did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to terminate the mother's parental rights during the pendency of the custody review order appeal; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite>                        applied only to dependency proceedings, not to termination proceedings, and allowing parents to delay termination proceedings by appealing custody review orders would have thwarted <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-100(5)</a></cite>,
                        which sought to place children in safe, permanent houses within a reasonable amount of time. In re R.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 539</cite>, 614 S.E.2d 489 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite> did not deprive a trial court of jurisdiction to grant a motion for termination of parental rights that was filed during the pendency of an appeal
                        from the trial court's dispositional order because (1) the statute only barred the trial court from exercising jurisdiction or holding hearings before the appellate court's mandate issued, (2) the mandate's issuance returned the
                        power to exercise subject matter jurisdiction to the trial court, and (3) the trial court did not exercise jurisdiction until after the mandate issued, as the trial court did not hear or decide the motion until after that issuance.
                        In re M.I.W., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 374</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 469 (2012).

                    <p>
                        Holding that <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite> did not deprive a trial court of jurisdiction to grant a motion for termination of parental rights that was filed during the pendency
                        of an appeal from the trial court's dispositional order was consistent with the purposes of the Juvenile Code because the holding minimized procedural delay, which was unnecessary to protect parental rights, but which interfered
                        with addressing a child's needs, and was consistent with the obligation of the Department of Social Services, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907(e)</a></cite> (repealed, see now
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>), to seek termination of parental rights within 60 days of a permanency planning hearing; allowing the timing of the filing of a termination
                        motion to decide if the trial court had jurisdiction elevated form over substance. In re M.I.W., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 374</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 469 (2012).

                    <p>
                        By the statute's own plain language, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003</a></cite> did not state that a trial court lacked jurisdiction over termination of parental rights proceedings during
                        pendency of an appeal, but instead specified that a trial court may not "exercise" the jurisdiction the court has until the appeal is resolved and the mandate has issued. In re M.I.W., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 374</cite>,
                        722 S.E.2d 469 (2012).

                    <p>
                        Appeal of Permanency Planning Order Not Mooted. - After a mother filed a notice of appeal of a permanency planning order under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1003ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1003(b)</a></cite>, the trial
                        court no longer had jurisdiction to rule on the petitions to terminate her parental rights under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101</a></cite>; consequently, the order terminating the mother's
                        parental rights was void ab initio, and did not render moot the appeal of the permanency planning order. In re Z.J.T.B., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 645 S.E.2d 206 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Lack of Timeliness. - Mother was not prejudiced by a trial court's delay in entering its order in a child neglect and pendency proceeding because neither the pendency of the trial court's order, nor an appeal, deprived the mother of reunification with
                        her children; if the mother had complied with the trial court's order, she could have requested a review hearing and sought custody of her children. In re T.S., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite>                        110, 631 S.E.2d 19 (2006), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 231</cite>, 641 S.E.2d 302 (2007).

                <p>
                    When an order of the court is affirmed by the Court of Appeals or by the Supreme Court, the trial court may modify or alter the original order as the court finds to be in the best interests of the juvenile to reflect any change in circumstances during
                    the period of time the appeal was pending. If the modifying order is entered ex parte, the court shall give notice to interested parties to show cause within 10 days thereafter as to why the modifying order should be vacated or altered.

                        Jurisdiction. - Trial court properly terminated a father's parental rights to his children because, while it was undisputed that he lacked minimum contacts with North Carolina, due process did not require a nonresident parent to have minimum contacts

                        Rules of Civil Procedure Not Superimposed on Hearings under Article. - This Article (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7B</a></cite>, Article 11) comprehensively delineates
                        in detail the judicial procedure to be followed in the termination of parental rights. It provides for the basic procedural elements which are to be utilized in these cases. Due to the legislature's prefatory statement in former
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7As0Va24Bs7A-289.22" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-289.22</a></cite> (see now this section) with regard to its intent to establish judicial procedures for the termination of parental
                        rights, and due to the specificity of the procedural rules set out in the article, the legislative intent was that this Article (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7B</a></cite>,
                        Article 11) exclusively control the procedure to be followed in the termination of parental rights. It was not the intent that the requirements of the Rules of Civil Procedure, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                        be superimposed upon the requirements of this Article. In re Allen, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 293 S.E.2d 607 (1982).

                        Because the trial court erred in allowing the county department of social services to amend the petitions to terminate a mother's parental rights to conform to the evidence, the original petitions failed to put the mother on notice that

                        rights, it does not supplant the parental rights proceedings; the language of subdivision (4) of this section (now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1100(4)</a></cite>) is that it shall not be

                        Counterclaim for Termination of Parental Rights. - Given both the statement of legislative intent in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1100(1)</a></cite> and the specificity of the procedures in
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-100</a></cite> et seq., Article 11 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7B</a></cite> provides the exclusive procedures
                        to be used in a termination of parental rights proceeding; a defendant therefore cannot rely on <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 13 as the basis
                        for a counterclaim for termination of parental rights. In re S.D.W. &amp; H.E.W., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 416, 653 S.E.2d 429 (2007).

                        visitation; rather, Article 11 contemplates that a termination petition should be brought in a separate action. In re S.D.W. &amp; H.E.W., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 416, 653 S.E.2d 429 (2007).

                        Because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1100</a></cite> et seq. provided the exclusive procedures for a termination of parental rights proceeding and contemplated that a termination petition
                        be brought in a separate action, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a termination of parental rights action brought as a counterclaim to a visitation action; although the trial court had tried to rectify the
                        error by having summonses issued under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)</a></cite>, the issuance of a summons alone did not vest a trial court with subject matter jurisdiction over
                        an action that was never properly commenced. In re S.D.W. &amp; H.E.W., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 416, 653 S.E.2d 429 (2007).

                        Final Order. - In dependency proceedings, a trial court's order finding that an agency should pursue termination of a father's parental rights and adoption of the father's child by the child's foster parents, based on a finding that the child's placement
                        with the father was "unlikely" and that it was in the child's best interests for the agency to pursue termination, was not a final order subject to appeal under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba10s7B-1001" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1001(4)</a></cite>.
                        In re A.R.G., <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 392</cite>, 646 S.E.2d 349 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Findings and Conclusions of Court. - In a proceeding to terminate parental rights pursuant to this Article (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7B</a></cite>, Article 11), the
                        trial judge must find facts based on the evidence and make conclusions of law which resolve the ultimate issue of whether neglect authorizing termination of parental rights is present at that time. Clark v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite>                        668, 373 S.E.2d 317 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was not an abuse of discretion, in a termination of parental rights proceeding, for a trial court to find that the subject child's adoption by the child's foster parents better served the child's best interests than placement of the child with the
                        child's relatives because the court (1) made findings regarding the relevant provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1100</a></cite>,
                        (2) made extensive findings as to the relative situations of the foster parents and the child's relatives, and (3) specifically provided the court's reasons for determining that the child's best interests would be served by termination
                        of parental rights and subsequent adoption by the child's foster parents, finding the foster parents had provided the child with a safe, stable, home, and the relatives did not timely present themselves in a reasonable time to
                        provide the child a safe permanent home. In re D.R.F., <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 693 S.E.2d 235 (2010), review denied, 705 S.E.2d 358, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 1041 (2010), review dismissed, 705 S.E.2d 359 (2010),

                    <p>
                        Summary Proceeding Not Allowed. - Article 24 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7A</a></cite> does not provide for a summary proceeding to determine whether the petitioner has proven
                        the existence of one or more of the grounds for termination. Thus, the trial court erred in granting petitioners' motion for partial summary judgment. Curtis v. Curtis, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 625, 410 S.E.2d
                        917 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Dual Burden of Proof Where Child Was Native American. - Where a minor child's status as a Native American made a termination proceeding under this Article also subject to the provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.), the federal
                        provision did not require that the North Carolina statutory grounds to terminate parental rights be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, a dual burden of proof was created in which the state provisions and federal provisions
                        had to be satisfied separately; i.e., the state grounds for termination had to be supported by clear and convincing evidence, while the federal law required evidence which justified termination beyond a reasonable doubt. In re
                        Bluebird, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite> 42, 411 S.E.2d 820 (1992).

                    <p>
                        Permanent Plan of Care. - The legislature has enunciated a public policy that every child should have a permanent plan of care. Because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent plan of care, and because
                        the superior court has jurisdiction over adoptions, that court's jurisdiction supersedes that of the district court with regard to the custody of a child who is the subject of a simultaneous adoption and custody proceeding. Griffin

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon the entry of an interlocutory order of adoption by the superior court, the jurisdiction of the district court with regard to the custody of the child who is the subject of the interlocutory order is in abeyance until such time as the interlocutory
                        decree is vacated, the adoption petition is dismissed, or a final decree of adoption is entered. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329 (1995).

                    <p>
                        The parental rights of a parent in his child are not to be bartered away at the parent's whim. Foy v. Foy, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 290 S.E.2d 748 (1982).

                    <p>
                        When the interests of the child and parents conflict, the best interests of the child control. In re Tate, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 312 S.E.2d 535 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The legislature expressed its intent that the best interests of the child are controlling by recognizing the necessity for any child to have a permanent plan of care at the earliest possible age, and by providing that action which is in the best interests
                        of the child should be taken in all cases where the interests of the child and those of his or her parents or other persons are in conflict. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 709,
                        336 S.E.2d 136 (1985).

                        Right to Object to Immunizations - Even though their parental rights had not been formally terminated, parents lost the right to object to their children's immunization, on religious grounds, where they lost custody of the children due to neglect, including
                        the failure to provide the children with adequate shelter, clothing, food, medical care, and a formal education. In re Stratton, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 428, 571 S.E.2d 234, review denied,
                        <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 436</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 512 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Best Interests of Child May Require That Family Not Be Dissolved. - The legislature has properly recognized that in certain situations, where the grounds for termination could be legally established, the best interests of the child, considering the intangibles,
                        indicate that the family unit should not be dissolved. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where there is a reasonable hope that the family unit, within a reasonable period of time, can reunite and provide for the emotional and physical welfare of the child, the trial court is given discretion not to terminate rights. In re Montgomery,
                        <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).

                    <p>
                        Discontinuance of Visitation Rights Following Affirmation of Termination. - The trial court did not err in entering an order discontinuing respondents' visitation rights, which order had allowed respondents to visit their children pending appeal of termination
                        proceeding, after the North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the termination, as the best interests of the children required that a permanent home be found for them, i.e., that steps be taken leading to their adoption. In re Montgomery,
                        <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 709, 336 S.E.2d 136 (1985).

        Right to Counsel.
       </b> - It cannot be said that the Constitution requires the appointment of counsel in every parental termination proceeding; therefore the decision whether due process calls for the appointment of counsel for indigent parents
                        in termination proceedings is to be answered in the first instance by the trial court, subject, of course, to appellate review. Lassiter v. Department of Social Servs., 452 U.S. 18, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640, rehearing

                        Mother who was facing termination of parental rights had the right to be represented by counsel; the trial court erred when it denied the mother's request for court-appointed counsel, even though the mother (1) had not answered a petition that the department
                        of social services filed, (2) did not attend a pretrial conference that the trial court scheduled, and (3) made her request for counsel on the day the case was set for a hearing.

                    The court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine any petition or motion relating to termination of parental rights to any juvenile who resides in, is found in, or is in the legal or actual custody of a county department of social
                    services or licensed child-placing agency in the district at the time of filing of the petition or motion. The court shall have jurisdiction to terminate the parental rights of any parent irrespective of the age of the parent. Provided,
                    that before exercising jurisdiction under this Article, the court shall find that it has jurisdiction to make a child-custody determination under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html#t50Aa02s50A-201" target="_blank">G.S. 50A-201</a></cite>,
                    50A-203, or 50A-204. The court shall have jurisdiction to terminate the parental rights of any parent irrespective of the state of residence of the parent. Provided, that before exercising jurisdiction under this Article regarding
                    the parental rights of a nonresident parent, the court shall find that it has jurisdiction to make a child-custody determination under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html#t50Aa02s50A-201" target="_blank">G.S. 50A-201</a></cite>                    or <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html#t50Aa02s50A-203" target="_blank">G.S. 50A-203</a></cite>, without regard to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html#t50Aa02s50A-204" target="_blank">G.S. 50A-204</a></cite>                    and that process was served on the nonresident parent pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106</a></cite>. Provided, further, that the clerk of superior court shall have jurisdiction for

                        Guardian Ad Litem Requirement - Where the allegations contained in a petition or motion to terminate parental rights tend to show that the respondent is incapable of properly caring for his or her child because of mental illness, the trial court is required
                        to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the respondent at the termination hearing pursuant to this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(6)</a></cite>.
                        In re Estes, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 579 S.E.2d 496 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 459</cite>, 585 S.E.2d 390 (2003).

                        and to appointed counsel in cases of indigency, unless the parent waives the right. A guardian ad litem shall also be appointed. In re Shepard, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 591 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

                        Although a trial court found, inter alia, that a mother suffered from significant mental health issues, it terminated her parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1)</a></cite>                        because she had neglected her daughter; however, because the mother's mental instability was so intertwined with a child's neglect, the trial court erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother pursuant to
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101</a></cite> at a parental rights termination hearing. In re J.D., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 176, 605 S.E.2d 643 (2004), cert. denied,

                        Mother was entitled to a guardian ad litem where the petition to terminate her parental rights alleged that depression and personality and emotional problems rendered her unable to parent her child; because the trial failed to appoint a guardian ad litem
                        for the mother, the termination order was reversed and the case was remanded. In re S.B., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 494, 602 S.E.2d 694 (2004).

                        Order terminating the parental rights of both parents to four minor children was reversed on appeal, because the trial court erred by failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for the parents, who had significant mental health issues that bore directly on
                        their ability to provide proper care and supervision of their children. In re B.M., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 607 S.E.2d 698 (2005).

                        Trial court did not err by not appointing a guardian ad litem for the mother for a termination of parental rights hearing as it was not alleged, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite>,
                        that the mother was incapable of properly caring for her children; additionally, whether the trial court should have appointed a guardian ad litem for the mother in a prior dependency proceeding was not an issue before the court
                        on the appeal of the termination of the mother's parental rights. In re O.C., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 457, 615 S.E.2d 391 (2005), cert. denied, - N.C. - , 623 S.E.2d 587 (2005).

                        but still considered her mental illness, even though it never mentioned <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite> as a factor in terminating her parental rights. Accordingly,
                        the mother was entitled to a new termination hearing and the appointment of a guardian ad litem. In re T.W., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 153, 617 S.E.2d 702 (2005).

                        Mother Was Not Entitled to Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem. - Mother was not entitled to the appointment of a guardian ad litem in an action to terminate her parental rights; the mother's sparse references to her need to counseling and drug treatment
                        did not rise to the level of being so intertwined with the neglect of her children and to be virtually inseparable and while the Department of Social Services recommended counseling, there was no significant evidence in the record
                        to suggest that the mother's parental rights were terminated due to any mental illness or substance abuse. In re As.L.G., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 551, 619 S.E.2d 561 (2005).

                        In termination of parental rights action, the trial court was not required to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101</a></cite>, because the termination
                        did not allege dependency. In re J.S.L., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 628 S.E.2d 387 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Trial court terminated a mother's parental rights based on: (1) neglect; (2) wilfully leaving the children in foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress; (3) wilfully failing to provide financial support to the children; and
                        (4) abandonment of the children for at least six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights; the mother did not request that a guardian ad litem (GAL) be appointed. Also, the petition
                        for termination of her parental rights did not allege the mother's incapability to parent the children, and no allegations were asserted, and no showing was made that the mother was incompetent; thus, the trial court was not required
                        to appoint a GAL to the mother under either <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101</a></cite> and 35A-1101, or G.S. 1A-1-17 . In re D.H., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                        700, 629 S.E.2d 920 (2006).

                        Appointment of a guardian ad litem was not compelled because the mother's mental illness was not a central factor in the trial court findings. In re J.M.W., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 788, 635 S.E.2d 916 (2006).

                        Failure to Appoint Guardian Ad Litem Is Not Reversible Error. - Where multiple grounds are alleged for termination of parental rights, including an allegation under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(6)</a></cite>                        that the parent is unable to provide for the care of the child, where that allegation is not pursued, and where valid findings support termination on other statutory grounds, it is not reversible error for a trial court to fail
                        to appoint a guardian ad litem for the parent, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101(1)</a></cite>. In re Dhermy, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 588 S.E.2d 555

                        Failure to Appoint Counsel Not Error. - In an action to terminate the mother's parental rights, the trial court's failure to appoint the mother a guardian ad litem did not amount to reversible error. There were no circumstances of the type that, of brought
                        to the judge's attention, would have raised a substantial question regarding the mother's competency. In re S.N.H., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 627 S.E.2d 510 (2006).

                        Right to Effective Assistance of Counsel. - If no remedy is provided for inadequate representation, the statutory right to counsel will become an empty formality, therefore, the right to counsel provided by this section includes the right to effective

                        Where lack of preparation for proceedings to terminate mother's parental rights was due to respondent's unexcused unavailability, the trial court did not err in denying her counsel's motion to continue or withdraw, and there was no denial of effective
                        assistance of counsel. Buncombe County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Burks, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 375 S.E.2d 676 (1989).

                    <p>
                        A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires the respondent to show that counsel's performance was so serious as to deprive the represented party of a fair hearing.

                        Mother who was facing termination of parental rights had the right to be represented by counsel; the trial court erred when it denied the mother's request for court-appointed counsel, even though the mother (1) had not answered a petition that the department
                        of social services filed, (2) did not attend a pretrial conference that the trial court scheduled, and (3) made her request for counsel on the day the case was set for a hearing.

                        Failure not to remove counsel was not an error - In a termination of parental rights proceeding where the father was alleged to have abused and neglected the children, the trial court did not err in not removing the father's attorney from the case on
                        the basis that counsel failed to schedule a new hearing in the abuse and neglect hearing, as the father did not show prejudice arising from there being no rehearing in the abuse and neglect proceeding prior to the termination hearing.

                        Residing or Found in District. - Where mother left with child for Ohio four days before the petition was filed, the child was not "residing in" or "found in" the district "at the time of filing" and therefore the petition failed for lack of subject matter
                        jurisdiction. In re Leonard, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 439, 335 S.E.2d 73 (1985).

                        Trial Court Had No Authority to Act Where No Request for Relief in Motion - Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter an order on the county Department of Social Services' (DSS) "motion in the cause," which was made at the previous direction
                        of the trial court for DSS to petition for termination of a mother's parental rights, where the motion lacked any request for relief, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                        Rule 7(b)(1); although the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over termination proceedings and motions therein, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba02s7B-200ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-200(a)(4)</a></cite> and

                        The district court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of petition filed, signed and verified by county division of social services, which alleged that child had been placed with DSS by its mother; that the putative father was unknown; that North
                        Carolina was the home state of the child and no other state had jurisdiction over the child; and that the best interest of the child would be served if the court assumed jurisdiction over him. In re Scearce,

                        District court in New Hanover County had jurisdiction over the father's petition to terminate the mother's parental rights despite the fact that Wake County still maintained jurisdiction over the child custody proceeding because the New Hanover County

                        When a child was undisputedly present in the county over which a district court had jurisdiction when a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child's father was filed in that court, and the father did not seek a change of venue after the petition

                        Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to enter an order terminating the father's parental rights even though the child and the child's custodial guardians resided in Alabama because no determination was made that the child's parents did not reside
                        in North Carolina. In re H.L.A.D., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 381, 646 S.E.2d 425 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 170</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 712 (2008).

                        Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to terminate a father's parental rights because North Carolina was the child's home State since she lived there with the mother, and Virginia no longer possessed exclusive, continuing subject matter jurisdiction;
                        neither the father, the mother, nor the child actually resided in Virginia at the time of the filing of the motion to terminate the father's parental rights. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                        52, 767 S.E.2d 905 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Court Had Jurisdiction. - There is no authority that compels dismissal of an action solely because petitioner fails to include the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(7)</a></cite> statement
                        of fact in a termination petition. In re J.D.S., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 244, 612 S.E.2d 350 (2005), cert. denied, - U.S. - , <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 64</cite>, 623 S.E.2d 584 (2005).

                        While the original summons was not yet dormant, because the second summons did not conform with the requirements of N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(d), the original action was discontinued, and the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction was reinvoked. Because the
                        parents were properly served with newly issued summons, commencing new actions and reinvoking the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction as of their respective dates of issuance, the contention that the court lacked subject
                        matter jurisdiction over the parties in the termination of parental rights hearing due to ineffective service was without merit. In re D.B., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 556, 652 S.E.2d 56

                        Neither before nor after the trial court's entry of the nonsecure custody orders had there been any custody proceedings instituted or custody orders entered in any state other than North Carolina, and the child had lived in the State with his foster parents
                        since September 2011, and thus North Carolina became the child's home state such that the trial court possessed jurisdiction to terminate the mother's parental rights. In re N.T.U., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite>                        722, 760 S.E.2d 49 (2014).

                        Trial court had exclusive, original jurisdiction over the termination of a parental rights case regarding a child pursuant to the statute and the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act because the child resided in, was found in, or was
                        in the legal or actual custody of a county department of social services at the time of filing of the petition, North Carolina was her home state, and process was served on the mother. In re N.P., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 12,

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction because regardless of any temporary emergency jurisdiction exercised during the initial period of the child's life or during the time leading up to her adjudication as a dependent and neglected
                        juvenile, it had exclusive, original jurisdiction over all petitions and motions concerning termination of parental rights pursuant to the statute and in conformance with the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.

                    <p>
                        Statute properly focuses the question of subject matter jurisdiction on the custody, location, or residence of the subject child in a termination of parental rights proceeding rather than on the residential state of the parents. In re N.P., - N.C. - ,

                        Continuing Jurisdiction. - Once jurisdiction of the court attaches to a child custody matter, it exists for all time until the cause is fully and completely determined. In re Scearce, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 531,

                        County court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the petition for termination of the father's parental rights because the very first allegation in the petitions to terminate parental rights was that the children were citizens and residents of
                        Washington State, which alone established the lack of subject matter jurisdiction for termination of parental rights; both children had resided in Washington state with the mother since 2007; they did not reside in and were not
                        found in Alexander County, North Carolina, when the petition was filed on October 17, 2011; and the children had never been in the legal or actual custody of the county department of social services or any child-placing agency.

                        that it had decided the claimed guardianship was void, without further explanation, it was impossible to review the trial court's decision and the appeals court was forced to hold that the trial court had lacked subject matter
                        jurisdiction due to the facial defects of the petition. In re Z.T.B., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 564, 613 S.E.2d 298 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Because the petition for termination of parental rights was not accompanied by a copy of the custody order then in effect, the petition failed to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court; that omission need not have been fatal if the Vance
                        County Department of Social Services (DSS) had simply amended the petition by attaching the proper custody order or otherwise ensured the custody order was made a part of the record before the trial court. Thus, it was the failure
                        by the DSS either to attach the custody order to the petition or to remedy that omission that ultimately deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                        790, 629 S.E.2d 895 (2006).

                        Where a petition to terminate parental rights was captioned with the names of both children, but the summons that was issued referenced only the younger child, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to terminate the mother's parental rights
                        in the older child because a summons pertaining to the child was not issued. In re C.T., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 643 S.E.2d 23 (2007).

                        Revised Statute. - Although prior versions of the statute also provided for the appointment of an assistive guardian ad litem for a parent who suffers from diminished capacity, the N.C. General Assembly eliminated that provision when it revised the statute.
                        In re J.R.W., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 765 S.E.2d 116 (2014), review denied 767 S.E.2d 840, 2015 N.C. LEXIS 44 (2015).

                        Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem. - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101.1</a></cite> requires that a guardian ad litem be appointed in accordance with the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                        N.C. R. Civ. P. 17 to represent a parent, meaning that where an allegation is made that parental rights should be terminated, a trial court is required to conduct a hearing to determine whether a guardian ad litem should be appointed
                        to represent the parent, and an allegation under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite> serves as a triggering mechanism, alerting the trial court that it should conduct a
                        hearing to determine whether a guardian ad litem should be appointed; at the hearing, the trial court must determine whether the parents are incompetent within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html#t35As0Ia01s35A-1101" target="_blank">G.S. 35A-1101</a></cite>,
                        such that the individual would be unable to aid in their defense at the termination of parental rights proceeding, and the trial court should always keep in mind that the appointment of a guardian ad litem will divest the parent
                        of their fundamental right to conduct his or her litigation according to their own judgment and inclination. In re J.A.A., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 623 S.E.2d 45 (2005).

                        Trial court complied with the statutory mandate in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101.1ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101.1(c)</a></cite> and did not err in failing to timely appoint a mother a guardian ad litem in a termination
                        of parental rights proceeding because the trial court appointed a guardian ad litem for the mother seventeen days after the petition for termination was filed and more than three months before the first hearing in the termination
                        proceeding took place; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101.1ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101.1(c)</a></cite> only mandates timely appointment of a guardian ad litem during a termination of parental rights proceeding. In

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by appointing a guardian ad litem for the mother in an assistance-only capacity under because the proposed guardian ad litem specifically testified that the mother was reasonable, smart, and understood the proceedings,
                        and the mother told the trial court that she graduated from high school, paid her bills, managed her daily affairs, and was capable of making her own decisions. In re A.R., <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite>                        302, 767 S.E.2d 427 (2014).

                        Discretion of Trial Court. - Statute vests discretion in the trial court, which may hold a hearing on appointing a guardian ad litem only for a parent who is incompetent, and the record established that the severity of the mother's mental health problems
                        was well known to the trial court, but they did not rise to the level of incompetency, and the record contained facts in keeping with a finding of competency, including in part that she attended a vocational rehabilitation program,
                        plus her denial of disability benefits was some evidence to support a finding of competency; the trial court did not err in not inquiring into her competency before holding a hearing to terminate her rights. In re J.R.W.,

                        must conduct a hearing in accordance with the procedures required under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 17, in order to determine whether there
                        is a reasonable basis for believing that a parent is incompetent or has diminished capacity and cannot adequately act in his or her own interest; if the court chooses to exercise its discretion to appoint a guardian ad litem under

                        the role that the guardian ad litem should play, whether one of substitution or assistance. In re P.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 737 S.E.2d 152 (2012).

                        Role of the guardian ad litem should be determined based on whether the trial court determines that the parent is incompetent or whether the trial court determines that the parent has diminished capacity and cannot adequately act in his or her own interest

                        can be given effect by focusing on the two separate prongs of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101.1ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101.1(c)</a></cite>, with one authorizing appointment of a guardian ad litem if the parent
                        is incompetent, while the second authorizing appointment of a guardian ad litem if the parent has diminished capacity; the extent of the parent's disability logically informs the role a guardian ad litem needs to play for the parent
                        in a termination of parental rights proceeding. In re P.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 737 S.E.2d 152 (2012).

                        Incompetent Or Has Diminished Capacity. - Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights because she had a substance abuse history and was schizophrenic, the allegations against her partly revolved around her multiple, serious mental health
                        conditions, her mental illness was one of the facts that led to her child's removal, and the trial court failed to conduct an inquiry into whether it was necessary to appoint her a guardian ad litem. In re T.L.H.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 765 S.E.2d 88 (2014).

                        Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem Not Required. - When it was alleged that a mother's parental rights to two children should be terminated because she (1) neglected them while they were in an agency's care within the meaning of
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101</a></cite>, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1)</a></cite>, (2) willfully left the children in foster
                        care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their removal, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>, and (3)
                        willfully failed to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of the children's care while in an agency's custody, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a3" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(3)</a></cite>, there was no requirement
                        that a guardian ad litem be appointed for the parent, even though the petition made reference to the mother's drug abuse and mental illness, because there was no allegation under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite>                        that the mother was incapable of caring for her children, she did not seek a guardian ad litem, and the trial court properly inquired into her competency, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,

                    <p>
                        It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to fail to inquire as to a mother's competency as: (1) the mother testified at the disposition hearing and the adjudication hearing about her employment; (2) the mention of the mother's emotional imbalance
                        and a psychiatric evaluation, which found her to have a flare for dramatic behavior, to be easily excited, to be prone to emotional outbursts, to be overly sensitive to the opinions of others, and to be impulsive and rebellious,
                        did not constitute a diagnosis of a mental health issue; (3) as the mother had made threats to harm the child, it was prudent to require a psychological evaluation before visitation resumed; and (4) doubting the mother's ability
                        to parent the child did not necessarily indicate that the mother was incapable of handling her affairs for <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101.1ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101.1(c)</a></cite> and

                        Guardian Ad Litem's Role Limited to One of Assistance, Not One of Substitution. - Pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101.1ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101.1(e)</a></cite>, the guardian ad litem's role was limited
                        to one of assistance, not one of substitution; therefore, the guardian ad litem did not have the authority to sign the notice of appeal in place of the parents challenging the termination of their parental rights. In re L.B.,

                        Removal of Guardian ad Litem. - Given the statutory changes, respondent's assistive guardian ad litem (GAL)would have been removed by operation of law, and nothing indicated that substantial questions had arisen regarding respondent's competency sufficient
                        to qualify her for a substitutive GAL when she had previously not qualified. In re J.R.W., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 765 S.E.2d 116 (2014), review denied 767 S.E.2d 840, 2015 N.C. LEXIS

                    <p>
                        In a termination of parental rights action, the trial court erred by failing to determine whether the mother was in need of a guardian ad litem pursuant to G.S. 7B-1101.1. The trial court should have inquired into the mother's competency pursuant to
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 17, given the allegations made by the Department of Social Services that the mother had problems controlling
                        the mother's anger, tended to be aggressive towards others, and lacked an understanding of the mother's prior neglect of the minor children. In re N.A.L., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 666 S.E.2d 768 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Withdrawal of Counsel. - Order terminating a mother's parental rights was vacated because he district court erred in allowing her counsel to withdraw her representation without first confirming that she had been notified of counsel's intention to do so;
                        the record was devoid of any evidence whatsoever that the mother received any notice from her trial counsel that counsel would seek to withdraw from her representation at the start of the termination of parental rights hearing.

                    <p>
                        Because a mother was already represented by counsel, she had no need for provisional counsel, counsel did not assume a provisional role in the proceeding, and the district court was not excused from the necessity for compliance with the usual procedures
                        required prior to the entry of an order allowing counsel to withdraw by virtue of the provisions of subsection (a)(1). In re M.G., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 767 S.E.2d 436 (2015).

                        Error in Permitting Counsel to Withdraw Without Notice to Parent. - Trial court erred by excusing the father's trial counsel from attending and participating in the termination of parental rights hearing when counsel failed to notify the father of his
                        intention to withdraw and the trial court did not continue the termination hearing to ensure the father was represented by counsel. In re D.E.G., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 381, 747 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Waiver of Right to Counsel. - In a parental rights termination case, the trial court did not err in allowing a child's mother to waive her right to counsel pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101.1</a></cite>                        and represent herself at the termination hearing, where the mother confirmed that she wanted to represent herself and the mother read and signed the waiver of counsel form, which expressly stated that she did not want the assistance
                        of a lawyer. In re J.K.P., <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 767 S.E.2d 119 (2014).

                    <p>
                        No Right to Appeal Found. - Respondent claimed that the order entered on her assistive guardian ad litem's motion to withdraw was fatally deficient because it does not make adequate findings or conclusions, but respondent had no right to appeal this order,
                        and even if she did, it would have been lost due to her failure to provide timely written notice of her intent to exercise that right. In re J.R.W., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 765 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Ineffective Assistance of Counsel. - Father was entitled to a new hearing on the termination of his parental rights because he was denied effective assistance of counsel; the father's counsel did not make sufficient efforts to communicate with him in
                        order to provide him with effective representation, and that failure deprived the father of a fair hearing. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 767 S.E.2d 905 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a termination of parental rights case, the record on appeal contained insufficient information to allow the appellate court to review the mother's ineffective assistance of counsel claim because it was silent on the reasons why counsel did not object
                        during the testimony of the witnesses for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not cross-examine those witnesses, and did not present any evidence; the record did not compel a conclusion that the mother did not cooperate
                        with her counsel and waived her right to representation or undermined her counsel's ability to advocate for her; and the appellate court declined to speculate about what counsel could have argued or how it would have affected the
                        outcome. In re C.D.H., - N.C. App. - , 829 S.E.2d 690 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Father failed to show that any of the alleged deficiencies in his counsel's performance or conduct would have resulted in a different outcome, and thus father could not prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In re G.G.M., - N.C. -

                    <p>
                        Filing a Petition. - District court re-acquired subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings because the Department of Social Services (DSS) initiated a new action by issuing a new summons and filing a termination of parental rights petition against
                        the father and the DSS had standing to file the petition under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)(4)</a></cite> due to the mother's relinquishment of custody
                        of her daughter to the DSS. In re A.L., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 781 S.E.2d 856 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Rehearing In Abuse And Neglect Proceeding Not Required - In a termination of parental rights proceeding, the father failed to show an error arising from the trial court's failure to hold a rehearing in the abuse and neglect proceeding prior to the case,
                        as such a hearing on abuse and neglect was redundant with parts of the termination hearing, and there was a length of delay resulting from an earlier appeal, the status of the children and the need to determine permanency had changed.

                        neglect, and dependency case, the summons would not have been required, and the agency would only have been required to service notice of the motion to terminate on the parties specified in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106.1</a></cite>.

                        Standing to File a Termination Petition. - District court re-acquired subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings because the Department of Social Services (DSS) initiated a new action by issuing a new summons and filing a termination of parental
                        rights petition against the father and the DSS had standing to file the petition under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103</a></cite> due to the mother's relinquishment
                        of custody of her daughter to the DSS. In re A.L., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 781 S.E.2d 856 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Orders granting the county department of social services (DSS) custody of a child were not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and DSS had standing to file the petition to terminate the mother's parental rights, because the trial court had "home
                        state" jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody determination regarding the child; the child had lived with the mother in North Carolina during the six months immediately preceding the filing of the juvenile petition. In re

                    <p>
                        Department of Social Services had standing to seek termination of the father's parental rights because the mother had relinquished her own parental rights and transferred legal custody of the child to the agency. In re E.B., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Sept.

                        Allegations of Standing by DSS. - Allegations of petition filed by county department of social services, though inartfully drafted, were sufficient to establish that DSS was a party entitled to petition for termination of respondent's parental rights
                        in her children pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7As0Va24Bs7A-289.24" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-289.24(3)</a></cite> (see now this section). Union County Dep't of Social

                    <p>
                        Agency's Lack of Standing Based on No Longer Having Custody of a Child. - Trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter an order terminating a mother's parental rights, because an agency no longer had custody of the child when it brought the termination action,
                        and therefore lacked standing to bring the action pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a3" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)(3)</a></cite>. In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>                        355, 590 S.E.2d 864 (2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since it was undisputed that the Department of Social Services (DSS) did not have custody of the children on the date upon which the petition was filed and the children were living in South Carolina at the time, at the time of the filing of the DSS petition,
                        DSS lacked standing to petition for termination of parental rights. In re D.D.J., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 628 S.E.2d 808 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Agency Had Standing Under Nonsecure Custody Order. - DSS had standing to file a termination of parental rights petition as it had been granted indefinite custody of a child under a nonsecure custody order issued under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-506ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-506(a)</a></cite>,
                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a3" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)(3)</a></cite> did not limit standing to parties granted custody by an order entered pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-905" target="_self">G.S. 7B-905</a></cite>,
                        but required only that DSS be granted custody by a court of competent jurisdiction. In re T.M., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 643 S.E.2d 471 (2007).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Agency Had Standing Under Valid Custody Order. - Summons was issued forthwith after the filing of the neglect and dependency petition, and even though the mother was never served with the summons, she made a general appearance in the action before the
                        trial court, thus waiving any defense as to personal jurisdiction. No defect in the trial court's jurisdiction otherwise appearing, the appellate court concluded that the trial court had jurisdiction over the underlying neglect
                        and dependency action and issued a valid custody order to the Department of Social Services (DSS), which gave DSS standing to file the instant petition for termination of parental rights per <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)</a></cite>.
                        In re J.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 182, 681 S.E.2d 485 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Agency Had Standing Since No Other Court Had Exercised Jurisdiction. - County department of social services had standing to file a termination petition under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a3" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)(3)</a></cite>                        since the record established that emergency jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html#t50Aa02s50A-204" target="_blank">G.S. 50A-204</a></cite> existed at the time the department filed its juvenile
                        petition, as a result, the department had been awarded custody by a court of competent jurisdiction, and those orders remained in effect pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html#t50Aa02s50A-204" target="_blank">G.S. 50A-204</a></cite>(b)
                        because no other orders had been entered by another state with jurisdiction. In re E.X.J., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 662 S.E.2d 24 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 9</cite>, 672 S.E.2d 19 (2009).

                        Substitution of DSS for Director as Petitioner. - Respondents were not entitled to dismissal of petition by reason of the erroneous designation of the director of the county department of social services as petitioner, and could in no way be prejudiced
                        by permitting DSS to ratify the petition and be substituted as petitioner. Union County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Mullis, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 340, 346 S.E.2d 289 (1986).

                        over the termination proceedings, where the child had continuously lived with the guardian ad litem for over two years when the petition for termination was filed. In re E.T.S., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 623

                        A guardian ad litem, who did not file or join in the filing of the petition and, thus, was not a party in a termination of parental rights case, did not have to be served with a copy of the notice of appeal by the parent; while a guardian ad litem for
                        a child in a termination of parental rights proceeding may, in some instances, be a petitioner, there is no statutory authority for that guardian ad litem to be a respondent or party. In re Brown,

                        No Standing To File Termination Petition. - In a case in which the court appointed custodians of a minor child filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child's mother, the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the custodians lacked standing.
                        The custodians did not fit within any of the requirements under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)</a></cite>, and contrary to their argument, their status as
                        custodians of the minor child did not give them the same rights as a guardian; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103</a></cite> referred to both custody and guardianship, and it could not be held
                        that the words custody and judicially appointed guardian as used in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103</a></cite> were not intended to have specific, distinct meanings.

                        Order terminating parental rights was vacated for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the juvenile petition was not properly verified, as the signature of the person before whom the petition was verified was illegible, nor was any title for that
                        person given, so (1) nothing showed that person's authority to acknowledge the verification, (2) nothing showed the department of social services obtained custody of the juvenile from a court of competent jurisdiction or had standing
                        to move to terminate parental rights, and (3) the trial court's orders were void ab initio. In re N.T., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 33, 769 S.E.2d 658 (2015).

                        of parental rights proceeding, was represented by counsel, and did not directly attack the prior neglect and dependency proceedings based on the failure to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother; G.S. 7B-1103(a)(5) was not
                        a statute of limitations, or the equivalent of one. In re E.T.S., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 623 S.E.2d 300 (2005).

                        While it is a correct statement of the law that a statute of limitations is tolled during the minority of a plaintiff, it does not follow that the two-year requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)(5)</a></cite>                        is a statute of limitations or the equivalent of such; this statute confers standing on the petitioners to file a termination of parental rights proceeding based on their two-year relationship with the child, which is in no manner
                        related to the parent or his or her relationship with the child during that two-year period, and the person or persons with whom legal custody lies during this time period is irrelevant.

                        Jurisdiction Absent Where Petition Was Insufficient. - Because the petition for termination of parental rights was not accompanied by a copy of the custody order then in effect, the petition failed to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court;
                        that omission need not have been fatal if the Vance County Department of Social Services (DSS) had simply amended the petition by attaching the proper custody order or otherwise ensured the custody order was made a part of the
                        record before the trial court. Thus, it was the failure by the DSS either to attach the custody order to the petition or to remedy that omission that ultimately deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re T.B.,

                        subject matter jurisdiction to enter the termination orders as: (1) the petition for adjudication with respect to child one contained a "Signature of Petitioner" as the "Director of DSS by an employee" and did not contain the signature

                        conferring custody of the children upon department of social services (DSS) was attached to the motion as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(5)</a></cite>;

                        was filed, the record contained a custody order awarding DSS custody of the children, and the mother failed to show that she was prejudiced in any way by the failure to physically attach a custody order to the motion. In re W.L.M.,

                        Trial Court Had Jurisdiction to Terminate Parental Rights. - Trial court had jurisdiction to terminate a mother's parental rights because it had jurisdiction over the underlying neglect and dependency action and issued a valid custody order to the county
                        department of social services, giving it standing to file the petitions for termination of parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a3" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)(3)</a></cite>;
                        a summons was issued a day after the juvenile petitions were filed, and although the mother was not served with the summonses until after their expiration, she made a general appearance in the action before the trial court at the
                        non-secure custody hearings, thereby waiving any objection to personal jurisdiction. In re S'N.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 581, 686 S.E.2d 917 (2009).

                        to confer jurisdiction on the trial court because it was verified, and the petition to terminate was proper because it was signed and verified. In re D.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 388,

                        Invocation of Court's Jurisdiction. - Like the verified pleadings in divorce and juvenile actions, verified petitions for the termination of parental rights are necessary to invoke the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter. In re Triscari
                        Children, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. App.</cite> 285, 426 S.E.2d 435 (1993).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the petition for termination of parental rights was not accompanied by a copy of the custody order then in effect, the petition failed to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court; that omission need not have been fatal if the Vance
                        County Department of Social Services (DSS) had simply amended the petition by attaching the proper custody order or otherwise ensured the custody order was made a part of the record before the trial court. Thus, it was the failure
                        by the DSS either to attach the custody order to the petition or to remedy that omission that ultimately deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                        790, 629 S.E.2d 895 (2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where Vance County Department of Social Services (DSS) filed a motion for termination of parental rights, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction only if the record included a copy of an order, in effect when the petition was filed, that awarded
                        DSS custody of the child; that was implicitly recognized by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(5)</a></cite>, which set out the requirements for a petition for termination
                        of parental rights, and provided in part that the petition would set forth the name and address of any person or agency to whom custody of the juvenile had been given by a court of North Carolina or any other state, and a copy
                        of the custody order would be attached to the petition or motion for termination. In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 790, 629 S.E.2d 895 (2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although a social services agency filed a petition to terminate a parent's parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1102" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1102</a></cite>, the petition was not verified as required
                        by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104</a></cite>; therefore, the trial court never obtained jurisdiction over the termination action, and the trial court's termination of parental rights order
                        was void. In re T.R.M., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 702 S.E.2d 108 (2010).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Pleading Requirements. - North Carolina Supreme Court agrees with the Court of Appeals that while there is no requirement that the factual allegations in a petition seeking to terminate parental rights be exhaustive or extensive, they must put a party
                        on notice as to what acts, omissions or conditions are at issue. In re B.C.B., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 32</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 748 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Attach Custody Order. - DSS's failure to attach a custody order to a termination of parental rights petition in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(5)</a></cite> was
                        not fatal as a mother did not demonstrate any prejudice arising from the technical defect, as there was no indication that the mother was unaware of the child's placement with DSS at any point during the case. In re T.M.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 643 S.E.2d 471 (2007).

                        any prejudice arising from the technical defect as from the time the father became a party to the case through his second counsel's withdrawal, he was consistently represented by counsel at hearings at which it was made abundantly
                        clear that his child was in DSS custody, and the attorneys' knowledge was imputed to the father. In re T.M., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 643 S.E.2d 471 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Father did not demonstrate prejudice from the guardian's failure to attach a copy of the custody order to the petition for termination, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(5)</a></cite>,
                        because there was no indication that the father was unaware of the child's placement at any point during the case; in fact, the father entered into a consent order providing for the child's guardianship with the guardians, relatives
                        of the child's mother. In re H.L.A.D., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 381, 646 S.E.2d 425 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 170</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 712 (2008).

                        Trial Court Had Subject Matter Jurisdiction, Even Though No Order Conferring Custody Was Attached to Motion. - Motion to terminate a mother's parental rights was not void ab initio, and the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, even though no order
                        conferring custody of the children upon department of social services (DSS) was attached to the motion as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(5)</a></cite>;
                        although under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103</a></cite>, to have standing to file for termination of parental rights, DSS had to prove that it had legal custody at the time the petition
                        was filed, the record contained a custody order awarding DSS custody of the children, and the mother failed to show that she was prejudiced in any way by the failure to physically attach a custody order to the motion. In re W.L.M.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 640 S.E.2d 439 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Order terminating parental rights was vacated on appeal because the failure of the department of social services to verify the petition seeking termination of parental rights as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104</a></cite>                        deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re C.M.H., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 807, 653 S.E.2d 929 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Order terminating parental rights was vacated for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the juvenile petition was not properly verified, as the signature of the person before whom the petition was verified was illegible, nor was any title for that
                        person given, so (1) nothing showed that person's authority to acknowledge the verification, (2) nothing showed the department of social services obtained custody of the juvenile from a court of competent jurisdiction or had standing
                        to move to terminate parental rights, and (3) the trial court's orders were void ab initio. In re N.T., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 33, 769 S.E.2d 658 (2015).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When an incarcerated parent is denied transportation to the hearing in contested termination cases, the better practice is for the court, when so moved, to provide the funds necessary for the deposing of the incarcerated parent. The parent's deposition,
                        combined with representation by counsel at the hearing, will ordinarily provide sufficient participation by the incarcerated parent so as to reduce the risk of error attributable to his absence to a level consistent with due process.
                        In re Quevedo, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. App.</cite> 574, 419 S.E.2d 158, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 483</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 397 (1992).

                    <p>
                        Petition Held Sufficient. - Although petitioners' bare recitation of the alleged statutory grounds for termination did not comply with the requirement in former G.S. 7A-289.25(6) (see now this section) that the petition state "facts which are sufficient
                        to warrant a determination" that grounds exist to warrant termination, the petition incorporated an attached custody award, and the custody award stated sufficient facts to warrant such a determination. In re Quevedo,
                        <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. App.</cite> 574, 419 S.E.2d 158, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 483</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 397 (1992).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss the father's petition for termination of the mother's parental rights due to the father's failure to include language, required under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(7)</a></cite>,
                        that the petition "has not been filed to circumvent the provisions of Article 2 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, the Uniform Child-Custody
                        Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act"; there was sufficient evidence to establish that the petition was not filed to circumvent the Act and to cure the father's error, and the mother failed to demonstrate she was prejudiced. In re
                        Humphrey, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 533, 577 S.E.2d 421 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in considering the issue of neglect due to the father's failure to allege that the mother had neglected the child since, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(6)</a></cite>,
                        the factual allegations in the father's petition were sufficient to give the mother notice as to the issue of neglect. In re Humphrey, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 533, 577 S.E.2d 421 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Allegations that the mother did not follow through with all of the components of the case plan, tested positive for marijuana, cocaine, and benzodiazepines, failed to hold a job, failed to obtain and maintain stable housing, and failed to pay child support
                        were sufficient to put the mother on notice of neglect allegations. In re A.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 612 S.E.2d 639 (2005).

                        There is no authority that compels dismissal of an action solely because petitioner fails to include the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(7)</a></cite> statement of fact in a termination
                        petition. In re J.D.S., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 244, 612 S.E.2d 350 (2005), cert. denied, - U.S. - , <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 64</cite>, 623 S.E.2d 584 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Although the termination of parental rights petition did not specifically refer to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite>, the petition, which contained language directly
                        paralleling <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite>, provided the mother with sufficient notice of the acts, omissions, or conditions on which the petition was based. In re
                        A.H., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 644 S.E.2d 635 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Termination petition was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the trial court; the father asserted no prejudice from the alleged omissions, and none were found. The father had access to all required information and the petition was substantially compliant
                        on its face. In re T.M.H., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 652 S.E.2d 1 (2007), review denied, stay denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 87</cite>, 657 S.E.2d 31 (2007.

                    <p>
                        Father's claim in termination of parental rights proceeding that the petition to terminate was deficient because the underlying juvenile petition was deficient had to be rejected; the underlying juvenile petition was sufficient to confer jurisdiction
                        on the trial court because it was verified, and the petition to terminate was proper because it was signed and verified. In re D.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 654 S.E.2d 1 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Petitioner specifically alleged that since September 2017, respondent had declined to exercise visitation as permitted by the trial court; thus, the petition contained more than a mere recitation of the statutory grounds for termination and gave respondent
                        sufficient notice of the acts or omissions at issue, and thus the trial court's denial of respondent's motion to dismiss was appropriate. In re B.C.B., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 32</cite>, 839 S.E.2d

                        Newly Identified Biological Father. - Defendant's proposed use of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 15 to deprive the court of personal jurisdiction
                        over the newly identified biological father, despite compliance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1105" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1105</a></cite>, through the creation of a "new action" when the biological father was eventually
                        identified and made a party to the action would have defeated the entire purpose of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1105" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1105</a></cite>;
                        therefore, the biological father was properly added as a party to the termination proceeding pursuant to the trial court's order and the subsequent issuance and service upon him of the summons and petition to terminate parental
                        rights in the minor child. Because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1105ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1105(b)</a></cite> did not require that the Department of Social Services file an amended petition upon identification of
                        the unknown parent, and the amended petition did not change or otherwise add an additional ground for terminating the father's parental rights and did not add a party to the proceeding as the biological father was already a party
                        to the termination proceeding, the amended petition to terminate parental rights to the minor child did not supersede the original petition such that a new action was brought upon its filing. In re M.M., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite>                        248, 684 S.E.2d 463 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Petition Held Insufficient. - While there was sufficient evidence to support the termination of mother's parental rights with regard to her two older children, including the children's multiple placements in foster homes, the mother's severe mental problems,
                        and the mother's inability to provide a stable residence, the trial court should have dismissed the Department of Social Services' petition for termination of parental rights as to her youngest child, removed from her care the
                        day after its birth, because the petition did not allege any facts to support the allegation that the mother was unable to provide for the proper care and supervision of this child, as was required by
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(6)</a></cite>. In re Hardesty, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 563 S.E.2d 79 (2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where a termination of rights petition did not address guardianship issues raised by the noncustodial parent respondent, where no custody order was attached, and where the trial court merely announced that it had decided the claimed guardianship was void,
                        without further explanation, it was impossible to review the trial court's decision and the appeals court was forced to hold that the trial court had lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to the facial defects of the petition.
                        In re Z.T.B., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 564, 613 S.E.2d 298 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the trial court erred in allowing the county department of social services to amend the petitions to terminate a mother's parental rights to conform to the evidence, the original petitions failed to put the mother on notice that
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite> would be a possible ground to support termination, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                        N.C. R. Civ. P. 15(b) did not apply, the termination order was reversed. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 660 S.E.2d 255 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 674</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 320 (2008).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the allegations in the termination of parental rights petition were bare recitations of the alleged statutory grounds for termination listed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>,
                        the motion to terminate the mother's parental rights failed to comply with this section, and was insufficient to put the mother on notice as to what acts, omissions, or conditions were at issue, and the termination of her rights
                        was improper. In re J.S.K., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 702, 807 S.E.2d 188 (2017).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was improper to terminate a father's parental rights for leaving the children in foster care for 12 months without reasonable progress to alleviate the conditions leading to the children's removal because the petition alleged no such ground, so the
                        father had no notice of the allegation. In re L.S., <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 565, 822 S.E.2d 506 (2018).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Service Held Sufficient. - Failure to attach custody order to petition to terminate parental rights or include statements within petition explaining petitioner's efforts to find parent, as required by former G.S. 7A-289.25 (see now this section), where
                        service was by publication, was not error which resulted in any prejudice to respondent, where service by publication complied with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                        Rule 4(j1), and informed respondent of the petition filed against her, her need to answer, the availability of counsel if she was indigent, and the telephone number of the Clerk of Juvenile Court if she needed further information.

                    <p>
                        Sufficiency of Seven-Day Order Inapplicable. - It was not necessary to decide if the seven-day order was sufficient under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104(5)</a></cite> because the trial
                        court admitted into evidence the order resulting from the hearing initially adjudicating the child to be a neglected child and awarding custody to the department. In re D.J.G., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 137, 643

                    <p>
                        Challenge to Sufficiency of Petition Not Preserved for Review. - Challenge to the sufficiency of the facts alleged in the termination petition was not preserved for appellate review because the father only objected to the sufficiency of the evidence,
                        not the legal insufficiency of the petition, when the father moved to dismiss the action after the presentation of the guardians' evidence and at the close of all evidence.

                        Former G.S. 7A-289.26 (see now this section) contains no provision to determine the "whereabouts" of the parent whose parental rights the petitioner seeks to terminate; rather, the section authorizes a preliminary hearing to ascertain the name or identity
                        of such parent. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 83, 332 S.E.2d 196, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 665</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 322 (1985).

                        Newly Identified Biological Father. - Defendant's proposed use of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 15 to deprive the court of personal jurisdiction
                        over the newly identified biological father, despite compliance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1105" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1105</a></cite>, through the creation of a "new action" when the biological father was eventually
                        identified and made a party to the action would have defeated the entire purpose of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1104" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1104</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1105" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1105</a></cite>;
                        therefore, the biological father was properly added as a party to the termination proceeding pursuant to the trial court's order and the subsequent issuance and service upon him of the summons and petition to terminate parental
                        rights in the minor child. Because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1105ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1105(b)</a></cite> did not require that the Department of Social Services file an amended petition upon identification of
                        the unknown parent, and the amended petition did not change or otherwise add an additional ground for terminating the father's parental rights and did not add a party to the proceeding as the biological father was already a party
                        to the termination proceeding, the amended petition to terminate parental rights to the minor child did not supersede the original petition such that a new action was brought upon its filing. In re M.M., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite>                        248, 684 S.E.2d 463 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Paternity Sufficiently Determined. - Father's paternity of the subject child in a termination of parental rights proceeding was sufficiently found because, while the father's putative paternity was sufficient to terminate the father's putative parental
                        rights, the trial court sufficiently identified the father as the child's father as the judgment found the father lied about fathering the child and referred to the father's mother as the child's paternal grandmother. In re A.N.S.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 767 S.E.2d 699 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was no error to terminate a father's parental rights without holding a preliminary hearing to find the father's paternity because, inter alia, contingent alternative allegations about a "John Doe" father were not inconsistent with the father's paternity,
                        as (1) no factual allegations suggested John Doe's paternity, and (2) the allegation's contingency was consistent with allegations that the father was not named on the birth certificate and paternity had not been judicially established.
                        In re A.N.S., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 767 S.E.2d 699 (2015).

                        Where the "name or identity" of a respondent parent is known, but his or her whereabouts are unknown, the petitioner in a parental rights termination case must proceed under former G.S. 7A-289.27 (see now this section) and must comply with

                        Service Upon Child. - Trial court did not err by exercising personal jurisdiction over a mother with regard to terminating her parental rights to her son by serving the summons required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5)</a></cite>                        upon the attorney advocate of the child's guardian ad litem rather than the guardian ad litem, because the guardian ad litem did not object at trial to the sufficiency of service nor did the guardian ad litem argue the issue on
                        appeal; the mother actually lacked standing to challenge service of the summons in that she was not an aggrieved party on that issue. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 616 S.E.2d 264 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because no summons was issued to the juvenile as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)</a></cite>, the order terminating the father's parental rights had to be vacated. In re
                        K.A.D., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 653 S.E.2d 427 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because a county agency failed to issue a summons to a minor child or the child's guardian ad litem under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5)</a></cite>, the trial court lacked subject
                        matter jurisdiction over a termination of parental rights proceeding; had the agency filed a motion to terminate under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1102" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1102</a></cite> in an ongoing juvenile abuse,
                        neglect, and dependency case, the summons would not have been required, and the agency would only have been required to service notice of the motion to terminate on the parties specified in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106.1</a></cite>.
                        In re I.D.G., <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 629, 655 S.E.2d 858 (2008), review dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 127</cite>, 673 S.E.2d 133 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Where the summons that was issued in a case involving the termination of parental rights named both the mother and father, but failed to name the juvenile, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to order that their parental rights in the juvenile be terminated.
                        Pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5)</a></cite>, the summons had to name the juvenile in order for the trial court to acquire subject matter jurisdiction
                        over the juvenile in a case involving the termination of parental rights. In re A.F.H-G, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 657 S.E.2d 738 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Service of Summons. - Though the child was not served the summons required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5)</a></cite>, nor was the child's guardian ad litem, but rather, the
                        guardian ad litem's attorney advocate received the summons regarding the termination of parental rights proceeding, such procedural irregularity caused no prejudice to the parents and the guardian ad litem never objected to the
                        same. In re B.D., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 620 S.E.2d 913 (2005), cert. denied, - N.C. - , 628 S.E.2d 245 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Termination of a mother's parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1)</a></cite> was vacated because the mother was not provided notice of the termination hearing
                        as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106</a></cite>, as there was no evidence that the addresses to which notices were sent were the mother's dwelling, and this fact, along with the
                        fact that the mother did not attend the hearing or respond in any way, refuted the presumption of valid service under G.S. 1A-1-4(j)(2). In re K.N., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 736, 640 S.E.2d 813 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where a petition to terminate parental rights was captioned with the names of both children, but the summons that was issued referenced only the younger child, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to terminate the mother's parental rights
                        in the older child because a summons pertaining to the child was not issued. In re C.T., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 643 S.E.2d 23 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a juvenile's guardian ad litem was represented by an attorney advocate in a termination of parental rights proceeding, the service of a summons on the attorney advocate amounted to service on the guardian ad litem. Therefore, service of the summons
                        on the guardian ad litem constituted service on the juvenile, as expressly stated in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)</a></cite>. In re J.A.P., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite>                        683, 659 S.E.2d 14 (2008).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the captions of the summonses named the children, and because the guardian ad litem (GAL) appointed for the children certified that the GAL was served with a copy of the summonses, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5)</a></cite>,
                        the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the mother's parental rights termination proceedings. In re N.C.H., <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 445, 665 S.E.2d 812 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 116</cite>,
                        678 S.E.2d 658 (2009).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the failure of a summons to comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5)</a></cite> implicated the trial court's jurisdiction over the children, not over the termination
                        of parental rights action as a whole, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1), a general appearance by the children's guardian
                        ad litem and attorney advocate waived any objection to the jurisdictional requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101</a></cite>. In re J.T., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 1</cite>,
                        672 S.E.2d 17 (2009).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over termination of parental rights proceedings against a mother and father because the caption of the summons contained the name of their child, and copies of the summons and petition were served on the child's
                        guardian ad litem at the county courthouse. In re I.T.P-L, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 670 S.E.2d 282 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 581</cite>, 681 S.E.2d 783
                        (2009).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court had exclusive, original jurisdiction over the termination of a parental rights case regarding a child pursuant to the statute and the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act because the child resided in, was found in, or was
                        in the legal or actual custody of a county department of social services at the time of filing of the petition, North Carolina was her home state, and process was served on the mother. In re N.P., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 12,
                        2021).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Party to Testify Without Issuance of Subpoena. - A respondent in a proceeding to terminate her parental rights is a party to the proceeding, and could be called to testify as an adverse party when she appeared at the proceeding, and a subpoena was not
                        required. In re Davis, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 448 S.E.2d 303, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 516</cite>, 452 S.E.2d 808 (1994).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right to Counsel. - Mother who was facing termination of parental rights had the right to be represented by counsel; the trial court erred when it denied the mother's request for court-appointed counsel, even though the mother (1) had not answered a petition
                        that the department of social services filed, (2) did not attend a pretrial conference that the trial court scheduled, and (3) made her request for counsel on the day the case was set for a hearing. In re Hopkins,
                        <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 38, 592 S.E.2d 22 (2004), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 632</cite>, 616 S.E.2d 230 (2005).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Summons Did Not Vest Trial Court With Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Improperly Commenced Action. - Because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1100</a></cite> et seq. provided the exclusive procedures
                        for a termination of parental rights proceeding and contemplated that a termination petition be brought in a separate action, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a termination of parental rights action brought
                        as a counterclaim to a visitation action; although the trial court had tried to rectify the error by having summonses issued under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)</a></cite>, the
                        issuance of a summons alone did not vest a trial court with subject matter jurisdiction over an action that was never properly commenced. In re S.D.W. &amp; H.E.W., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 416, 653 S.E.2d 429
                        (2007).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Improper Issuance of Summons Only Implicated Personal Jurisdiction, Not Subject Matter Jurisdiction. - Although a summons in a juvenile neglect proceeding was not properly signed pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-406" target="_self">G.S. 7B-406</a></cite>                        and 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(b), only personal jurisdiction, rather than subject matter jurisdiction, was implicated, and where the parents appeared in the neglect proceeding and they failed to object thereto, such defense was waived;
                        a termination of parental rights in reliance on the neglect order was valid. In re K.J.L., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 343</cite>, 677 S.E.2d 835 (June 18, 2009).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Waiver of Insufficient Process by Making General Appearance. - Since the failure of a summons to comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1106ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5)</a></cite> implicated the trial court's
                        jurisdiction over the children, not over the termination of parental rights action as a whole, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P.
                        12(h)(1), a general appearance by the children's guardian ad litem and attorney advocate waived any objection to the jurisdictional requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101</a></cite>.
                        In re J.T., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 1</cite>, 672 S.E.2d 17 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Although a mother received improper service of a summons to a petition seeking to terminate her parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                        Rule 4, because she acknowledged service 285 days after the summons was issued, she waived any objection to the trial court's jurisdiction by answering and appearing. In re N.E.L., <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 576,

                        The absence of an answer denying any of the material allegations of the petition does not authorize the trial court to enter a "default type" order terminating the respondent's parental rights.

                        No Right to File Counterclaim. - Statutorily established procedure for termination of parental rights under former G.S. 7A-289.29 (see now this section) does not include the right to file a counterclaim. In re Peirce, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite>                        373, 281 S.E.2d 198 (1981).

                        Guardian's Physical Presence. - As <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1108" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1108</a></cite> mandated the guardian
                        ad litem's (GAL) physical presence at a termination of parental rights hearing, because a GAL was not present the court presumed prejudice, as the children were not represented by a GAL at a critical stage of the termination proceedings.
                        In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 165, 695 S.E.2d 162 (2010).

                        While the presence of the minor children's nonattorney guardian ad litem (GAL) volunteer at a termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing was preferable, the nonlawyer volunteer's attendance was not mandatory because, given the role of the attorney advocate
                        to assist the GAL, the general assembly did not intend by the use of the word "represent" in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1108ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1108(b)</a></cite> to obligate the volunteer
                        GAL to appear in court during the TPR hearing unless the attorney advocate or the trial court deemed the GAL's presence necessary to protect the minor's best interests; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1108" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1108</a></cite>                        did not impose on the GAL volunteer a special duty to "represent" a juvenile beyond what <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601</a></cite> required of a GAL as an appointed member of the GAL program.
                        The GAL program performed the duties listed in 7B-601(a). In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 171</cite>, 711 S.E.2d 118 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the child from the beginning of a termination proceeding; a GAL and an attorney advocate performed distinct and separate roles, so the appointment of the attorney advocate as the GAL
                        after three and a half days of testimony was insufficient, even though the advocate had been involved in the case from an earlier time. In re R.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 614 S.E.2d
                        382 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Because five different guardian ad litems (GAL) made sporadic appearances for a mother's children at different hearings over a three-year period, and the only GAL actually appointed by the court never appeared at any hearing, there was no GAL discharging
                        their duty to protect and promote the best interests of the children until formally relieved of the responsibility by the court as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601(a)</a></cite>.

                        Failure To Appoint Guardian Harmless Error. - Trial court did not err in conducting a permanency planning review hearing in the absence of a guardian ad litem appointed to represent a juvenile because the juvenile's mother neither asserted nor argued
                        prejudice as a result of the absence of a guardian ad litem at the permanency planning hearing; according to the plain language of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1108" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1108</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-601" target="_self">G.S. 7B-601</a></cite>, the guardian ad litem's appointment did not terminate until the permanent plan had been achieved for the juvenile and approved by the court,
                        and consequently, the guardian ad litem was required to continue to represent the juvenile at the permanency planning review hearing, but, standing alone, the failure to adhere to the requirement during a permanency planning hearing
                        did not warrant reversal and, as such, the matter was subject to harmless error review. In re H.K.L., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (May 3, 2011).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Failure to Appoint Guardian Ad Litem Not Unreasonable. - In a termination of parental rights case, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to forego guardian ad litem (GAL) assistance in determining the child's best interests because a social worker
                        testified about the child's current foster care placement, his relationship with his foster parents, and his emotional and developmental needs; the mother testified about her current living arrangement, employment, drug and alcohol
                        abstinence, and family support system; the grandmother testified about her desire and ability to assume the child's care and custody; and the trial court's comments at the conclusion of the termination hearing clearly demonstrated
                        that the child's best interests were carefully weighed against the evidence presented. In re P.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 794 S.E.2d 843 (2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Child was not required to have a guardian ad litem appointed where no response to the termination petition was filed. In re A.L.Z., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 808 S.E.2d 176 (2017), review denied, stay lifted,
                        stay denied, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 260 (2018) review denied, stay lifted, stay denied, 811 S.E.2d 165, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 260 (2018).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Failure of the record to disclose guardian ad litem papers did not require reversal where the guardian ad litem was noted as present at every hearing prior to and including the termination hearing where she represented the interests of the children. In
                        re A.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 612 S.E.2d 639 (2005).

                        Clerical Error. - Attorney was appointed to serve as both the guardian ad litem (GAL) and attorney advocate for the child, and the failure of the district court judge to check the GAL box was merely a clerical error; the attorney was referred to as the
                        GAL in the written adjudication and disposition order, neither the father nor his counsel expressed any concerns or raised any issues regarding the attorney's role as GAL, and it was clear from the record and transcript that the
                        trial court did appoint the attorney as GAL. In re C.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 42</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 742 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Attorney who was appointed to serve as guardian ad litem (GAL) and attorney advocated investigated the case prior to the termination hearing and reported his observations to the trial court, such that competently fulfilled his role as GAL, and the trial
                        court's clerical oversight in its execution of the proper form regarding its failure to check the GAL designation box for the person whom it properly designated on the same form to serve as attorney advocate was not prejudicial
                        error. In re C.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 42</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 742 (2020).

                        Preservation for Review. - Petition to terminate a mother's parental rights was not filed by a guardian ad litem, and no guardian ad litem had previously been appointed for the child; therefore, the trial court was required to appoint the child a guardian
                        ad litem under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1108ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1108(b)</a></cite>, although the mother did not preserve this issue for appeal. In re A.D.N., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite>                        54, 752 S.E.2d 201 (2013), review denied, 755 S.E.2d 626, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 232 (2014).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the mother failed to object to the lack of a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the child during the termination proceedings, the issue was not preserved for appellate review; furthermore, the appellate court did not find it necessary to invoke the rule
                        suspending the Rules of Appellate Procedure to prevent manifest injustice to either the mother or the child and to review the decision not to appoint a GAL in light of the mother's willful failure to make progress on her case plan,
                        both before and after reunification efforts were ceased, and because a GAL appointment was not statutorily required. In re P.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 794 S.E.2d 843 (2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mother failed to preserve the issue of whether a child should been appointed a guardian ad litem for appellate review where she had not objected at trial, and she made no argument that invocation of N.C. R. App. P. 2 was necessary to prevent manifest
                        injustice. In re A.L.Z., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 808 S.E.2d 176 (2017), review denied, stay lifted, stay denied, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 260 (2018) review denied, stay lifted, stay denied,

                        Statutory Requirements Mandatory. - Terminating a father's parental rights on grounds of abandonment and neglect by abandonment erred because (1) the father did not willfully abandon the children during the six months before the petition was filed, as
                        the father sought the children's custody during that time, and (2) findings based on a consent order granting the children's custody to others, terminating the father's child support obligation, denying the father visitation, and
                        purporting to waive any objection to termination, erred, as the order was void as against public policy, since the statutory termination process had to be followed, any agreement to relinquish parental rights avoided this process,
                        and the order's terms did not meet statutory requirements for a consent to adoption or relinquishment of parental rights to an agency. In re C.K.C., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 158, 822 S.E.2d

                        Because proof of both the parent's incapability to provide proper care and supervision and the parent's lack of an alternative child care arrangement is required to terminate parental rights under subsection (a)(6), a trial court may adjudicate the nonexistence
                        of this ground by finding the absence of either element, or by finding the petitioner's failure to prove either element by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>,

                        petition for the termination of parental rights; this reiterates that the trial courts must make findings of those material and ultimate facts from which it can be determined whether the findings are supported by the evidence and
                        whether they support the conclusions of law reached, and this requirement is consistent with the trial court's duty regarding the entry of judgments following civil bench trials. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>,

                        Father could not contend that certain issues did not lead to the juvenile's adjudication as neglected because he stipulated to the findings of fact and consented to the child's adjudication as a neglected juvenile; therefore, one finding of fact, which
                        was stipulated to by the father in the adjudication order, supported another finding of fact in the order terminating the father's parental rights in the child. In re O.W.D.A., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                        Trial court's finding that the essential underlying issues of the neglect adjudication that concerned the father were his abuse of alcohol and illegal substances as well as housing and employment instability was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing
                        evidence because although the direct issues that led to the adjudication of neglect primarily related to the mother, the trial court was permitted to consider indirect issues which contributed to the child's neglect and removal.

                        Termination of a mother's parental rights was inappropriate because all findings of fact had to be based on clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. However, the factual findings which the trial court made were insufficient to support the termination of
                        the mother's parental rights under any of the statutory grounds considered. In re K.H., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                        Mother's parental rights were properly terminated because there was a pattern of neglect due to housing instability, substance abuse, leaving the juveniles with inappropriate caretakers, and domestic violence; the mother and the children had resided at
                        a homeless shelter, and after her incarceration for drug violations, she had failed to make proper arrangements for the children's care. In re N.B., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 23, 2021).

                        Father's parental rights were properly terminated because he did not provide support for the child, and although the father did send a letter in which he asked for the child's forgiveness, the letter in question had been his first contact with the child
                        after her entry into state custody; as a result, the record adequately supported the trial court';s finding concerning the inconsistency of the father's contacts. In re N.B., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 23, 2021).

                        which directly related to his case plan; there was no error in the trial court's findings of fact regarding the father's failures in accomplishing his case plan, most of which resulted from circumstances for which he was responsible.

                        Voluntary Dismissal of First Petition. - Fact that county department of social services had dismissed a prior petition for termination of mother's parental rights did not preclude a subsequent petition since the best interests of the children was always
                        the primary focus, with no procedural rule barring the court's continuing jurisdiction over such a matter. In re L.O.K., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 621 S.E.2d 236 (2005).

                    <p>
                        The termination of parental rights statute provides for a two-stage termination proceeding: Former G.S. 7A-289.30 governs the adjudication stage, while former G.S. 7A-289.31 governs the disposition stage of a termination proceeding. In re Montgomery,
                        <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984); In re White, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 344 S.E.2d 36, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 283</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 470 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Former G.S. 7A-289.30 and former G.S. 7A-289.31, when read together, mean that in the adjudication stage, the petitioner must prove clearly, cogently, and convincingly the existence of one or more of the grounds for termination listed in former G.S. 7A-289.32.
                        Once the petitioner has proven this ground by this standard, it has met its burden within the statutory scheme of former G.S. 7A-289.30 and 7A-289.31. The petitioner having met his burden of proof at the adjudication stage, the
                        court then moves on to the disposition stage, where the court's decision to terminate parental rights is discretionary. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).

                        In a proceeding to terminate parental rights on the grounds of abuse, a prior adjudication of abuse was binding upon the court. It still had to be shown, however, by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, that the grounds for termination, i.e., abuse
                        or the probability of its repetition, existed at the time of the termination proceeding. The court then had to determine whether termination was in the child's best interest. In re Alleghany County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Reber,
                        <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 331 S.E.2d 256 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 382</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 851 (1986).

                    <p>
                        At the adjudication stage, petitioner is required to prove the existence of grounds for termination listed in former G.S. 7A-289.32 by clear, cogent and convincing evidence, pursuant to former G.S. 7A-289.30(e), while at the disposition stage, the court's
                        decision as to whether to terminate parental rights is discretionary. In re White, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 344 S.E.2d 36, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 283</cite>, 347

                    <p>
                        Proceeding for termination of parental rights requires the trial court to conduct a two part inquiry; subsection (e) of this section directs that the court first shall take evidence, find the facts, and shall adjudicate the existence or nonexistence of
                        any of the circumstances set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>, which authorize the termination of parental rights of the respondent. Disposition
                        is governed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>, which provides in relevant part that, upon a finding that any one or more of the conditions authorizing a termination of the parental
                        rights of a parent exist, the court shall issue an order terminating the parental rights of such parent unless the court shall further determine that the best interests of the juvenile require that the parental rights of the parent
                        not be terminated under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)</a></cite>. In re Baker, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 581 S.E.2d 144 (2003).

                        Adjudication and disposition are the two phases required by subsection (e) of this section in a termination of parental rights proceeding, but there exists no requirement that the two phases be conducted during separate hearings. At the adjudication phase,
                        the petitioner has the burden of proving there is clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supporting at least one statutory ground under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>                        for termination, and at the disposition phase, the determination is whether it is in the best interests of the child to terminate parental rights. In re Dhermy, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 588 S.E.2d 555 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the initial adjudication phase of the trial, the petitioner seeking termination must show by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that grounds exist to terminate parental rights and a finding of any one of those grounds is sufficient to support
                        termination of parental rights. If the petitioner succeeds in establishing the existence of any one of the statutory grounds, the trial court moves to the second, or dispositional, stage, where it determines whether it is in the
                        best interests of the child to terminate the parental rights; so long as the court applies the different evidentiary standards at each of the two stages, there is no requirement that the stages be conducted at two separate hearings.
                        In re Shepard, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 591 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

                        Timeline of Termination Proceedings. - Allowing the mother to stay the termination proceedings pending an appeal of a custody review order would have precluded compliance with the termination timeline mandated under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907</a></cite>                        (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>), <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109</a></cite>, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>,
                        and this would have been improper. In re R.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 539</cite>, 614 S.E.2d 489 (2005).

                        Timeliness of Hearing. - Where the termination of parental rights hearing was initially set for less than one month outside that 90-day window, by agreement of the parties, the hearing was continued, and took place within the 90-day continuance window,
                        and there was no showing of prejudice, there was no due process violation. In re J.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 678, 632 S.E.2d 237 (2006), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 341</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Failure to conduct a termination hearing within 90 days after petition was filed did not require reversal because the father was not prejudiced by the delay; the Department of Social Services stated that the long delay was the result of it's inability
                        to serve process on the father and the mother because of an incorrect address. In re R.R., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 628, 638 S.E.2d 502 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Failure to hold a termination of parental rights hearing within 90 days did not require reversal because the oldest child's detailed plan showed that the delay was due to the extraordinary efforts by the trial court to allow the mother to demonstrate
                        an ability to parent the three younger children by monitoring the mother's performance in parenting the older child; rather than prejudicing the mother, the efforts inured to the mother's benefit, affording the mother every possible
                        opportunity to be reunited with the children. In re C.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 644 S.E.2d 630 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Time limitations in the Juvenile Code were not jurisdictional in termination cases and did not require reversal of orders in the absence of a showing by the appellant of prejudice resulting from the time delay; the mother made no serious effort to establish
                        prejudice, but rather argued that the late filing resulted in prejudice per se, which was a contention consistently rejected, and in any event, the record revealed no violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(a)</a></cite>                        under circumstances in which the continuances of the termination hearing were because of the need to appoint new counsel for the mother, to allow time for responsive pleadings, to allow the mother discovery, and to allow sufficient
                        time to fully hear the case. In re D.J.G., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 137, 643 S.E.2d 672 (2007).

                        Holding of a hearing on a termination of parental rights petition 133 days after the petition was filed was not fatal, even though <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(a)</a></cite> required
                        that the hearing commence within 90 days, as the father failed to show prejudice resulting from the delay. In re T.M., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 643 S.E.2d 471 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although an adjudication hearing was held well beyond the 90-day period under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(a)</a></cite>, a mother was not prejudiced as additional visits with the
                        child or a custody hearing would not have changed the ultimate outcome of the termination of parental rights proceedings. In re A.R.D., <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. App.</cite> 500, 694 S.E.2d 508, aff'd., <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 596</cite>,

                        In a termination of parental rights case where the trial court failed to adhere to the statutory time for holding a hearing, the father should have filed a petition for writ of mandamus but offered no explanation for his failure to do so at any point
                        during the 33 months between the filing of the termination petition and the termination hearing. Instead, the father sat on his rights and allowed the delay to continue without objection. In re C.R.L., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar.

                    <p>
                        Standard of Proof. - Although this section does not specifically require the trial court to affirmatively state in its order terminating parental rights that the allegations of the petition were proved by clear and convincing evidence,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-807" target="_self">G.S. 7B-807</a></cite> does require such a statement, and without such an affirmative statement the appellate court is unable to determine if the proper standard of proof
                        was utilized. In re Church, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 654, 525 S.E.2d 478 (2000).

                        During adjudication, the North Carolina Department of Social Services has the burden of proving by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that one or more of the statutory grounds set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>                        for termination exists.

                        Father's neglect of his minor child under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite> was shown at the adjudication stage by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in that the father did
                        not provide any support for the child, did not communicate with the child, and visited the child only a few times. In re Yocum, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 580 S.E.2d 399 (2003).

                        Trial court's finding under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a3" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(3)</a></cite> that a mother failed to contribute to the cost of her children's foster care, despite being physically and
                        financially able to do so, was not supported by clear, cogent and convincing evidence, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(f)</a></cite>; the only evidence presented to the
                        trial court on this subject established that she had been employed at various times since 1999 and did not address whether she was employed during the six months preceding the filing of the termination petition or whether she had
                        the financial ability to contribute to the children's support during that time. In re Faircloth, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 588 S.E.2d 561 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court properly identified the standard of proof under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(f)</a></cite> by using a clear and cogent standard of proof because the father failed to show
                        he was prejudiced since he did not challenge any of the trial court's factual findings. In re M.D., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 35, 682 S.E.2d 780 (2009).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While it would have been preferable for a trial court to have plainly stated its standard of proof for all of the findings of fact, based upon the language in one finding of fact, the lack of evidence of an erroneous standard, and the oral rendition stating
                        the appropriate standard, the trial court used the correct standard of proof. In re A.B. J.B., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 35, 781 S.E.2d 685 (2016), review denied, 793 S.E.2d 695, 2016 N.C.

                        <b>
        Burden of Proof.
       </b> - Although the burden was on family relatives to show that a mother lacked a suitable alternative child care arrangement, the relatives presented no evidence to meet their burden. Therefore, because the trial court
                        failed to make the required finding and no evidence was presented that would have allowed it to make such a finding, reversal of the portion of the trial court's order relying upon the ground of dependency for termination was appropriate.

                    <p>
                        Exercise of Discretion. - Former G.S. 7A-289.30 and 7A-289.31 provide that the court may exercise its discretion in the dispositional stage only after the court has found that there is clear and convincing evidence of one of the statutory grounds for
                        terminating parental rights during the adjudicatory stage, and no discretion may be exercised during the adjudicatory stage. In re Carr, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 448 S.E.2d 299 (1994).

                    <p>
                        Separate Hearings Not Required. - Although the court is required to apply different evidentiary standards at each of the two stages of adjudication and disposition, there is no requirement that the stages be conducted at two separate hearings. In re White,
                        <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 344 S.E.2d 36, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 283</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 470 (1986); In re Parker, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 423, 368 S.E.2d 879 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Bifurcation of Hearing Not Required. - Hearing transcript showed the trial court heard dispositional evidence from a social worker and the guardian ad litem (GAL) and received the GAL's dispositional report into evidence; although the dispositional evidence
                        was intertwined with adjudicatory evidence, a trial court was not required to bifurcate the hearing into two distinct stages. In re S.M.M., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 911</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 8 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Record Testimony. - Where respondent argued that he must receive a new hearing because children's testimony, which was taken in chambers with all counsel present, was not recorded, respondent did not argue any error in the unrecorded testimony
                        itself and failed to show prejudice. In re Nolen, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 453 S.E.2d 220 (1995).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Taking of Evidence Needs to Include Oral Testimony. - Although a trial court considering a termination of parental rights petition can consider written reports, prior court order, and oral arguments by the attorneys involved in the case, some oral testimony
                        needs to be taken by the court. In re A.M., <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 665 S.E.2d 534 (2008).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Denial of Continuance Proper. - Because a parent did not demonstrate any extraordinary circumstances that necessitated a continuance, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in initially denying the parent's motion to continue. In re C.J.H.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 772 S.E.2d 82 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Denying a mother's second motion to continue a termination hearing in order to obtain her older son's testimony was not an abuse of discretion as she was granted a month-long continuance for that purpose after the initial hearing, and she made no showing
                        that extraordinary circumstances required a second continuance, provided only a vague description of the expected testimony, and did not tender an offer of proof to demonstrate significance. In re A.L.S.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 515</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 89 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Father failed to demonstrate to the trial court that good cause existed for the continuance of the termination of parental rights hearing to a juncture beyond 90 days from the date of the initial petition because his procrastination in addressing his
                        court-ordered obligation to report to the counseling center for the essential evaluation directly resulted in the shortness of time for the parties involved in the hearing to have access to the psychosexual evaluation of the father.

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly determined that a mother was not entitled to a continuance on the ground that she was awaiting trial for criminal charges, and the mother failed to demonstrate any violation of her constitutional rights in the denial of her motion,
                        because the charges against the mother did not arise from the "transaction or occurrence" that led to the juvenile petition but arose after the petition; the trial court provided adequate safeguards to protect her due process rights.

                        Waiver of Counsel Due to Inaction Improper. - The General Assembly did not intend to allow for waiver of court appointed counsel due to inaction prior to the hearing. If a parent is present at the hearing and does not waive representation, counsel shall
                        be appointed. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 191, 487 S.E.2d 823 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Ruling by the trial court that parents right to counsel was waived by inaction prior to the termination hearing was prejudicial error. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 191, 487 S.E.2d 823 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Mother who was facing termination of parental rights had the right to be represented by counsel; the trial court erred when it denied the mother's request for court-appointed counsel, even though the mother (1) had not answered a petition that the department
                        of social services filed, (2) did not attend a pretrial conference that the trial court scheduled, and (3) made her request for counsel on the day the case was set for a hearing. In re Hopkins, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite>                        38, 592 S.E.2d 22 (2004), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 632</cite>, 616 S.E.2d 230 (2005).

                        Removal of Counsel. - In a termination of parental rights proceeding where the father was alleged to have abused and neglected the children, the trial court did not err in not removing the father's attorney from the case on the basis that counsel failed
                        to schedule a new hearing in the abuse and neglect hearing, as the father did not show prejudice arising from there being no rehearing in the abuse and neglect proceeding prior to the termination hearing. In re Faircloth,
                        <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 565, 571 S.E.2d 65 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Sign Termination Order Within 30 Days. - When a trial court did not sign a written order terminating a father's parental rights within 30 days of the hearing resulting in that order, the trial court's statutory violation did not require that
                        its order be vacated, as no authority compelled such a result, and, on the facts, that was not an appropriate remedy for the statutory violation as the father's neglect and abandonment of the child were proved by clear, cogent,
                        and convincing evidence, and the father did not show he suffered any prejudice from the trial court's delay. In re J.L.K., <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 311, 598 S.E.2d 387 (2004), cert. denied,

                    <p>
                        Mother was not entitled to reversal of an order terminating her parental rights despite the fact that it was entered more than 30 days after the hearing because she failed to show that she suffered prejudice as a result of the late order. In re P.L.P.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 618 S.E.2d 241 (2005), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 361</cite>, 625 S.E.2d 779 (2006).

                        Extraordinary delay of almost one year after the termination hearing in entering the order terminating a mother's parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite>,

                        Trial court's entry of an order 83 days following the termination of parental rights hearing did not constitute prejudice per se, requiring a new hearing; the mother failed to articulate any prejudice she suffered. In re S.N.H.,

                        Delay in Entering Order Requires Prejudice for Reversal. - Trial court erred by not entering its termination order within the statutory time frame, but reversal was not required since the parents did not show how they were prejudiced by the delay. In
                        re D.R., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 300, 616 S.E.2d 300 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction over a termination of parental rights hearing because the trial court did not comply with the time limits as set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(a)</a></cite>                        and (d) as: (1) each continuance granted by the trial court was necessary in order for all the essential parties to be present and to provide testimony and evidence at the termination hearing; (2) at no time did mother object to
                        any delay or continuance; and (3) the mother failed to provide any argument as to how she, or the children, were specifically prejudiced by the delay. In re W.L.M., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 640 S.E.2d 439

                        the mother failed to meet the burden to show prejudice caused by the delay in scheduling the hearing; the delay inured to the mother's benefit since it gave the mother more time to address housing, employment, individual counseling,
                        and substance abuse issues. In re C.T., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 643 S.E.2d 23 (2007).

                        Delay in Entering Termination Order. - Seven month delay between a termination hearing and the trial court's entry of its termination order ran counter to the legislative intent in enacting the 30-day requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>, and prejudiced the mother, who was prevented from filing an appeal until seven months after the hearing; pending the appellate court's
                        determination of the appeal, the child remained in the department's custody, and subsequent court proceedings involving the child were limited to those "temporary" orders authorized by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1113" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1113</a></cite>.

                        Order terminating a father's parental rights was reversed, where the trial court entered its order more than five months after the conclusion of the termination hearing; the late entry of the written order was a clear and egregious violation of

                        When a trial court failed to state ground for granting a youth and family services' continuance in a petition to terminate a mother's parental rights without stating the grounds as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(d)</a></cite>,
                        and there was a delay of almost 11 months beyond the 90-day deadline of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(a)</a></cite> before a hearing was held on the petition, the delay was egregious
                        because the services' termination of the mother's visitations with the children constituted a de facto termination of the mother's parental rights 14 months prior to the matter actually coming before the trial court; for 14 months
                        the mother was denied the company and familial relationship with her children solely through the inaction of the services and the trial court, and thus showed that she was prejudiced by the delay.

                        While a mother claimed that she was prejudiced by the delay in the trial court's filing of the written adjudication order, because she offered no evidence in support of this bare assertion, the state presented clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of
                        her extreme neglect of her two minor children, such supported the termination of her parental rights; moreover, as the trial court announced its adjudication of neglect and its decision to terminate the mother's parental rights
                        in open court, the delay in reducing the trial court's order to writing did not prejudice the mother and, thus, did not warrant reversal of the termination order. In re J.A.P., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite>                        683, 659 S.E.2d 14 (2008).

                        When a trial court took a best interests determination under advisement at the end of a termination hearing, the trial court abused its discretion in denying the mother's motion to re-open the evidence because, at the time of the mother's motion, the
                        court had not yet made the best interests determination required to terminate the mother's parental rights <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>;
                        the mother filed her motion on April 12, 2012, the trial court heard and orally denied the motion on April 17, 2012, and the order terminating parental rights was entered on April 18, 2012.

                        Delay in Hearing Due to Request for Counsel. - The trial court did not err by holding a hearing on the petition to terminate the mother's parental rights outside of the initial 90-day time requirement where the other's request for appointment of counsel
                        led to the delay. In re S.N.H., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 627 S.E.2d 510 (2006).

                        -1110(a), -1111(a); all parties were prejudiced, as the mother and child lost time together, the foster parents were in a state of flux, and the adoptive parents were unable to complete their family plan.

                    <p>
                        Untimely termination of parental rights hearing did not require dismissal of the termination petition because the father's own motion for a continuance added 68 days to the trial court's original error and the father was not prejudiced thereby. In re

                        Trial court's failure to timely enter its adjudication and disposition order in a termination of parental rights action did not warrant reversal because that would only further delay the determination regarding the children's custody in opposition to

                        Finding of Neglect. - Trial court properly terminated the father's parental rights on the ground that the father neglected the father's children, because the father expressed some interest in visitation rights, but only if a paternity test showed that
                        the father was one child's biological father. In re Mills, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 567 S.E.2d 166 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 672</cite>, 577 S.E.2d 627 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Order terminating mother's parental rights to her four minor children was proper because the children were previously adjudicated neglected, there was a probability of repetition of neglect if returned to the mother, four to five trial placements with
                        the mother had failed, the mother had a history of failing to show a positive response to counseling and educational programs, the mother left a stable job and housing to move to another state where she did not have employment
                        or independent housing, and she had been unable to cope with the pressure of caring for the children at the same time, with such findings being sufficient to establish neglect under G. S. 7B-1111(a)(1). In re L.O.K.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 621 S.E.2d 236 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Termination of a father's parental rights based on the probability of repetition of neglect was supported by substantial evidence that showed that the father made no effort to visit his son in the five months prior to termination hearing, that the father
                        met with a parenting class instructor only once even though parenting classes were part of case plan, and that the father held only occasional part-time jobs. In re J.E.M., <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite>                        361, 727 S.E.2d 398 (2012).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        District court's findings supported the conclusion that the father's parental rights were subject to termination as the child would likely be neglected again if the child were returned to the father's care because the mother struggled with basic parenting
                        skills and relied on the father as a main support for parenting; the father was willing to leave the child alone in the care of the mother even though the mother was unfit for such accountability; the parents continued to be in
                        constant marital discord even while having supervised visits with the child; and the parents intended to remain together despite the aforementioned problems. In re Z.V.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 207</cite>,
                        835 S.E.2d 425 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ground of neglect for termination of a father's parental rights existed because the father was convicted for sexually abusing children and denied responsibility for those convictions, had persistent and serious mental health issues that affected the father's
                        ability to parent the child, and lacked stable housing until shortly before the termination hearing. Furthermore, the district court found that there was a high probability that a repetition of neglect would have occurred in the
                        future if the child were to have been placed with the father. In re N.P., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 61</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 801 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court properly terminated a father's parental rights based on neglect as there was no requirement that he be responsible for the prior adjudication of neglect, he made minimal efforts to show interest in the child while incarcerated, and the record
                        evidence showed that the father was responsible for his failure to satisfy his case plan's requirements. Moreover, the evidence supported the trial court's findings that the child was likely to be neglected if returned to the father's
                        care, the father was responsible for the lack of visitation, and his convictions and sentence were drug-related. In re S.D., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 67</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 315 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Findings Not In Error. - In light of the frequent interchangeable usage of the terms "ground" and "grounds" in legal authorities to refer to a singular basis for a decision, the trial court did not harbor a mistaken belief that multiple statutory grounds
                        for termination were necessary in order to terminate a father's parental rights; by itself, the trial court's use of the phrase "necessary grounds," which pluralized the term "ground," did not connote the commission of error by
                        the trial court. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 56 (2020).

                        Findings Insufficient. - Trial court's evidentiary findings did not meet the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(1), as applied

                        The proper evidentiary standard of proof in termination of parental rights proceedings is clear and convincing evidence. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        "Clear and convincing" and "clear, cogent, and convincing" describe the same evidentiary standard. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The clear, cogent and convincing standard is greater than the preponderance of the evidence standard required in most civil cases, but not as stringent as the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt required in criminal cases. In re Montgomery,
                        <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).

                        Statement of Clear and Convincing Evidence Required. - When construing <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-807" target="_self">G.S. 7B-807</a></cite> and this section together to determine legislative intent, under subsection
                        (f) of this section, the trial court is required to affirmatively state in its order the standard of proof utilized in the termination proceeding. In re Church, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 654, 525 S.E.2d 478 (2000).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under former G.S. 7A-289.32, where the trial court failed to state that its findings in the adjudicatory stage of a proceeding to terminate parental rights were made by "clear, cogent and convincing evidence," the Court of Appeals could not determine
                        if the correct standard of proof had been applied and, therefore, reversed the trial court's order terminating the parents' rights. In re Lambert-Stowers, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite> 438,

                        Court May Consider Previous Adjudication. - In determining whether there is neglect which authorizes the termination of parental rights, the trial court is allowed to consider a previous adjudication of neglect. It must also consider any evidence of changed
                        conditions in light of the evidence of prior neglect and the probability of a repetition of neglect. In re Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 347 S.E.2d 495 (1986).

                        Admissibility of Psychological Reports. - The clear intent of the legislature is that a hearing upon a motion for review is in the nature of a dispositional hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing, and that the formal rules of evidence do not apply.
                        Therefore, the trial court could properly consider written psychological reports in determining, on a motion brought by parents whose parental rights had been terminated under former G.S. 7A-289.34, whether the needs of the children
                        would best be served by modification of its previous orders concerning visitation. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 709, 336 S.E.2d 136 (1985).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although psychological evaluations in termination case were not court-ordered, they were relevant and admissible. Buncombe County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Burks, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 676, 375 S.E.2d 676 (1989).

                    <p>
                        Standard for Review on Appeal. - On appeal, when a trial court's order is reviewed as not being supported by the evidence, the appellate court looks to see whether there is clear, cogent, and convincing competent evidence to support the findings. If there
                        is such competent evidence, the findings are binding upon the court on appeal. In re Allen, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 293 S.E.2d 607 (1982).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Standard of Review. - The standard of review in termination of parental rights cases is whether the findings of fact are supported by clear, cogent and convincing evidence and whether these findings, in turn, support the conclusions of law; courts then
                        consider, based on the grounds found for termination, whether the trial court abused its discretion in finding termination to be in the best interest of the child. Evidence heard or introduced throughout the adjudicatory stage,
                        as well as any additional evidence, may be considered during the dispositional stage. In re Shepard, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 591 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Effect of Findings on Appeal. - Factual findings must be based on clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. Such properly supported findings are binding on appeal, even though there may be evidence to the contrary. Furthermore, findings of fact not excepted
                        to are deemed to be supported by competent evidence and are conclusive on appeal. In re Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 411, 333 S.E.2d 554 (1985); Clark v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite>                        668, 373 S.E.2d 317 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appellate court found that remand for further action was necessary because the findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of the trial court's ruling terminating parental rights were insufficient for appellate review. In re O.J.R.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 769 S.E.2d 631 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Limited findings of fact and the single conclusion of law included in the trial court's termination order did not permit meaningful appellate review and, therefore, were insufficient to support its decision denying a mother's petition to terminate a father's
                        parental rights; the trial court neglected to find the ultimate facts that would be dispositive of any of the termination grounds, and its general conclusion of law offered no analysis of the legal standards applied to the mother's
                        claims. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 56 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Make Reasonable Progress. - Record held to demonstrate a failure on the part of parents to make reasonable progress toward improving home conditions during the period in which parents' children were in foster care, despite the fact that they
                        showed a willingness to provide for the children during part of the time at issue. Herell v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 387 S.E.2d 230 (1990).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trial court's findings were insufficient to terminate the mother's rights since it did not address whether the mother could pay support, address the concerns leading to the child's removal, or list the unmet conditions. In re Locklear,
                        <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 566 S.E.2d 165 (2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Termination of the mother's parental rights based on the ground of failure to make reasonable progress was proper because she had not maintained stable employment for a minimum of six months; she failed to obtain stable housing for at least six months
                        as her frequent moves constituted evidence of housing instability, and she was days shy of having resided at her current residence for the designated six-month period of time; and she failed to complete the recommended treatment
                        needed to fully address the core issues of substance abuse and domestic violence which had played the largest roles in the children's removal. In re I.G.C., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 201</cite>, 835
                        S.E.2d 432 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper based on her willful failure to make reasonable progress because, inter alia, the mother voluntarily placed the children in the custody of the county department of social services so that the father
                        could live with her; and she failed to protect her children by allowing the father, who had assaulted her and two of the children, to return to the family home. In re A.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>,
                        835 S.E.2d 417 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Late Entry of Termination Order Held Reversible Error. - Trial court reversibly erred in failing to enter an order terminating a mother's parental rights over her children until over 180 days after the termination hearing, in violation of
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>, because the long delay was highly prejudicial
                        to the mother, the children, and the foster parent. In re L.E.B., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 610 S.E.2d 424 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Termination Order Vacated. - Order terminating a father's parental rights was vacated because the trial court failed to make specific findings of fact or to state in its conclusions of law that the father's actions were willful, and, thus the findings
                        did not conclusively establish grounds for termination of parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)</a></cite>; without an identified basis
                        for the adjudication under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite>, effective review of the termination order was precluded. In re T.M.H., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite>                        451, 652 S.E.2d 1 (2007), review denied, stay denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 87</cite>, 657 S.E.2d 31 (2007.

                    <p>
                        Findings were insufficient to support a determination that the father had neglected his child because the father's incarceration alone could not serve as clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of neglect, the order did not establish that the father failed
                        to comply with the domestic violence-related portions of his case plan or engaged in continued acts of domestic violence, trial court's finding that the father had submitted three diluted drug screens was insufficient to support
                        a determination as to the likelihood of future neglect, and the trial court's finding that the father had not provided financially for the child, along with its determination that the father received SSI benefits and was not required
                        to pay child support, did not support its finding of neglect. In re K.N., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 274</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 861 (2020).
                        <br />

                        Termination Held Warranted. - Where a jailed father asked not to be taken to court to appear at a parental rights termination hearing, it showed that the child was not a priority and that the child was a neglected and abandoned; termination of the father's
                        parental rights was therefore in the child's best interest. Whittington v. Hendren (In re Hendren), <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 576 S.E.2d 372 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Termination of the mother's parental rights was in the son's best interest as he had a strong bond with his current foster family and was forming a long-term attachment to them; he was receiving structure and stability from the foster family; he needed
                        permanence and continued therapy; and the mother was no longer participating in his therapy and had not called to inquire about his welfare. In re A.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>, 835 S.E.2d
                        417 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was in the children's best interests to terminate a mother's parental rights because the trial court thoroughly considered the children's developmental challenges and their likelihood of adoption
                        based on the children's then placement and potential future adoptive parents. Furthermore, there was testimony that the children were thriving and showing great improvement developmentally in their placements. In re J.H.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 264</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 847 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Findings fully supported the trial court's conclusion that grounds existed to terminate a mother's parental rights based upon her willful failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care during the children's placement in county department of social
                        services custody because the mother was on notice of her failure to pay something towards the cost of care for her children; the trial court repeatedly found in its permanency planning orders that none of the parents were paying
                        child support. In re S.E., - N.C. - , 838 S.E.2d 328 (2020).

                    <p>
                        County department of social services did not satisfy its burden of proving the allegations in its juvenile petitions by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109</a></cite>                        because the subject children were not neglected juveniles under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(15)</a></cite>, nor dependant juveniles under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(9)</a></cite>;
                        the trial court in its ruling properly entered uncontested findings of fact that: (1) the father possessed a gun, but did not point it at the mother or the children during a domestic disturbance; (2) the parents' three oldest children
                        left their residence with the father, but no kidnapping was reported, and an Amber Alert was not issued; (3) the district attorney's office dismissed the charges against the father for communicating threats to and assault by pointing
                        a gun at the mother; and (4) the father was not in possession of a gun when he was arrested. In re H.M., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 308, 641 S.E.2d 715 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Order terminating a father's parental rights was improper because it did not identify any <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)</a></cite> grounds for termination and did not indicate the
                        evidentiary standard under which the trial court made its adjudicatory findings of fact; without an identified basis for adjudication, effective review of the termination order was precluded, and without a finding of willfulness,
                        there was insufficient basis for a finding of abandonment, and the father's incarceration alone was insufficient to support the termination order. Bolick v.

                        Statutory Requirements Mandatory. - Terminating a father's parental rights on grounds of abandonment and neglect by abandonment erred because (1) the father did not willfully abandon the children during the six months before the petition was filed, as
                        the father sought the children's custody during that time, and (2) findings based on a consent order granting the children's custody to others, terminating the father's child support obligation, denying the father visitation, and
                        purporting to waive any objection to termination, erred, as the order was void as against public policy, since the statutory termination process had to be followed, any agreement to relinquish parental rights avoided this process,
                        and the order's terms did not meet statutory requirements for a consent to adoption or relinquishment of parental rights to an agency. In re C.K.C., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 158, 822 S.E.2d
                        741 (2018).

                        Trial court must comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(c)</a></cite> in denying a
                        petition for the termination of parental rights; this reiterates that the trial courts must make findings of those material and ultimate facts from which it can be determined whether the findings are supported by the evidence and
                        whether they support the conclusions of law reached, and this requirement is consistent with the trial court's duty regarding the entry of judgments following civil bench trials. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>,
                        845 S.E.2d 56 (2020).

                    <p>
                        The termination of parental rights statute provides for a two-stage termination proceeding: G.S. 7A-289.30 [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109</a></cite>] governs the adjudication stage,
                        while this section governs the disposition stage of a termination proceeding. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a proceeding to terminate parental rights on the grounds of abuse, a prior adjudication of abuse was binding upon the court. It still had to be shown, however, by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, that the grounds for termination, i.e., abuse
                        or the probability of its repetition, existed at the time of the termination proceeding. The court then had to determine whether termination was in the child's best interest. In re Alleghany County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Reber,
                        <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 331 S.E.2d 256 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 382</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 851 (1986).

                    <p>
                        In a department of social services' petition to terminate a father's parental rights, the trial court found the department met its burden of proving by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence at least one of the grounds in G.S.7B-1111, and then proceeded
                        to the dispositional phase to consider whether termination was in the children's best interests, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>. In re Shermer,
                        <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 576 S.E.2d 403 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Proceeding for termination of parental rights requires the trial court to conduct a two part inquiry; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite> directs that the court first shall
                        take evidence, find the facts, and shall adjudicate the existence or nonexistence of any of the circumstances set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>, which authorize the
                        termination of parental rights of the respondent. Disposition is governed by this section, which provides in relevant part that upon a finding that any one or more of the conditions authorizing a termination of the parental rights
                        of a parent exist, the court shall issue an order terminating the parental rights of such parent unless the court shall further determine that the best interests of the juvenile require that the parental rights of the parent not
                        be terminated under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)</a></cite>. In re Baker, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 581 S.E.2d 144 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the initial adjudication phase of the trial, the petitioner seeking termination must show by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that grounds exist to terminate parental rights and a finding of any one of those grounds is sufficient to support
                        termination of parental rights. If the petitioner succeeds in establishing the existence of any one of the statutory grounds, the trial court moves to the second, or dispositional, stage, where it determines whether it is in the
                        best interests of the child to terminate the parental rights; so long as the court applies the different evidentiary standards at each of the two stages, there is no requirement that the stages be conducted at two separate hearings.
                        In re Shepard, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 591 S.E.2d 1 (2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a petitioner meets its burden of proving at least one ground for termination of parental rights exists under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)</a></cite>, then a trial court proceeds
                        to the dispositional phase and determines whether termination of parental rights is in the best interest of the child. In re D.M.W., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 679, 619 S.E.2d 910 (2005), cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 364</cite>,
                        629 S.E.2d 850, rev'd, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 583</cite>, 635 S.E.2d 50 (2006).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obligation of Trial Court to Consider Best Interests. - Having adjudicated the father's willful abandonment of the child, the trial court was obliged to determine whether it was in the child's best interests to terminate the father's parental rights,
                        and to do so without regard to any competing interest of him. In re K.N.K., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 50</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 735 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the trial court found that a mother proved by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that at least one ground to terminate the father's parental rights existed - that the father willfully abandoned the children - the trial court was therefore
                        required to make dispositional findings about whether termination was in the children's best interests. In re J.D.C.H., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Sept. 25, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Timeline of termination proceedings. - Allowing the mother to stay the termination proceedings pending an appeal of a custody review order would have precluded compliance with the termination timeline mandated under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-907" target="_self">G.S. 7B-907</a></cite>                        (repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>), <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109</a></cite>, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>,
                        and this would have been improper. In re R.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 539</cite>, 614 S.E.2d 489 (2005).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adjudication order in a neglect and dependency proceeding was essential to subject matter jurisdiction in a termination of parental rights action under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>                        and a jurisdiction defect in the summonses in the neglect and depending proceeding required vacation of the order terminating a mother's parental rights. In re K.J.L., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 670 S.E.2d
                        269 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Exercise of Discretion. - Former G.S. 7A-289.31 (see now this section) and the predecessor to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109</a></cite> provide that the court may exercise its discretion
                        in the dispositional stage only after the court has found that there is clear and convincing evidence of one of the statutory grounds for terminating parental rights during the adjudicatory stage, and no discretion may be exercised
                        during the adjudicatory stage. In re Carr, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 448 S.E.2d 299 (1994).

                        Required Findings of Fact. - In proceedings to terminate a mother's parental rights, a trial court's order concluding that termination was in the child's best interests did not comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>                        because the trial court did not make any written findings of fact regarding the issues of whether termination would aid in the accomplishment of the permanent plan, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>(3),
                        and the quality of the bond between the child and the mother, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)(4)</a></cite>. In re J.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 741 S.E.2d
                        333 (2012).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given the totality of the evidence and the trial court's extensive order, the court clearly considered the factors in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>, and it was in the best interest
                        of the juveniles that the parental rights of the parents be terminated. In re L.M.T., <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 165</cite>, 752 S.E.2d 453 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that termination of parental rights was in a child's best interests because the court considered: (1) the bond between the juvenile and the parent; and (2) the quality of the relationship between
                        the juvenile and the proposed adoptive parent. In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 763 S.E.2d 314 (2014).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating a mother's parental rights because it made the requisite findings, and those findings revealed a reasoned decision; the trial court made findings, supported by competent evidence, concerning the
                        likelihood of adoption for the mother's children concerning whether termination of the mother's parental rights would aid in the accomplishment of the permanent plan of adoption, and concerning the bond between the mother and children.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was no possible error by the trial court and the order terminating the father's parental rights was affirmed; the order included sufficient findings, supported by clear evidence, that at least one statutory ground for termination existed, plus the
                        trial court made appropriate findings on each of the relevant dispositional factors and did not abuse its discretion in assessing the children's best interests. In re A.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite>                        422, 812 S.E.2d 875 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Trial court made sufficient findings in determining that the termination of respondent's parental rights was in the child's best interest, and thus the termination order was affirmed. In re T.N.H., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 403</cite>,
                        831 S.E.2d 54 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's evidentiary findings did not meet the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(1), as applied to adjudicatory orders

                        of the ultimate facts required to support an adjudication of the existence or nonexistence of the circumstances in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Trial court's written findings were sufficient to demonstrate its consideration of the parties' evidence regarding the bond between the children and the mother under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)(4)</a></cite>                        where once the children were placed with the kinship provider, the mother did not visit the children, failed to maintain regular contact with them, and made no efforts to complete the goals of the Out of Home Family Services Agreement
                        for either child. In re C.V.D.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 525</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 202 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mother's contention that the trial court only nominally addressed the statutory factors was without merit; the trial court considered the factors along with the facts of the case, finding in part that one child did not have a bond with mother and actively
                        resisted having any contact with her, the other child did have bond with mother, and neither child was in a pre-adoptive placement and the department was trying to locate a foster home that would adopt both children together. In
                        re H.A.J., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Enter Findings. - Transcript demonstrated that the trial court did carefully consider each of the statutory criteria, and although the better practice would have been for the trial court to make written findings as to the factors, the failure
                        to do so did not constitute reversible error; there was no conflict regarding the likelihood of adoption, no bond existed between the father and the children, and because this was a private termination proceeding, there was no
                        permanent plan for the children within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>. In re A.U.D., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 3</cite>, 832 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Findings Not Challenged. - Father did not challenge any of the trial court's best interest findings and therefore they were binding on appeal, plus the court was satisfied that the trial court's findings showed due consideration of the dispositional factors.
                        In re E.H.P., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 388</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 49 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Findings Binding on Appeal. - Finding related to the likelihood that the children would be adopted had the requisite evidentiary support and was binding on appeal as it was supported by the testimony of the guardian ad litem, the social worker, and the
                        adoption specialist. In re I.N.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 542</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 214 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Findings as to the nature and extent of the mother's bond with the children were binding as they were supported by the social worker's testimony. In re I.N.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 542</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 214 (2020).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Findings Not Required. - Mother and her boyfriend had not set a wedding date, and thus the factor of their relationship was not sufficiently relevant to require the trial court to make findings concerning the impact of said relationship on termination
                        of the father's parental rights or on the adoption of the child. In re C.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 42</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 742 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As this case involved a private termination of parental rights initiated by the child's mother, who had full custody of the child at the time, the likelihood of the child's potential adoption was not a sufficiently relevant factor in determining whether
                        termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interests. In re C.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 42</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 742 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since there was no conflicting evidence about either the likelihood of each child's adoption if the mother's rights were terminated or one child's strong bond with his prospective adoptive parents, no written findings were required in this regard; as
                        no prospective permanent placement had been identified for the other two children, that factor did not apply. The trial court did not violate the statutory mandate as to its determination of the children's best interests. In re
                        J.S., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 811</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 66 (2020).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A finding that children are well settled in their new family unit does not alone support a finding that it is in the best interest of the children to terminate other parent's parental rights. Bost v. Van Nortwick, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite>                        1, 449 S.E.2d 911 (1994).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Differences in Oral and Written Findings. - Party failed to show the existence of error based merely on the fact that there were differences between the findings orally rendered at the hearing and those set forth in the written order. In re A.U.D.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 3</cite>, 832 S.E.2d 698 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Written Findings Not Explicitly Required. - It is clear that a trial court must consider all of the factors in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>, but the statute does not explicitly
                        require written findings as to each factor. In re A.U.D., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 3</cite>, 832 S.E.2d 698 (2019).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        At the dispositional stage a court is required to issue an order of termination unless it "determines that the best interests of the child require that the parental rights of such parent not be terminated." In re Parker,
                        <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 423, 368 S.E.2d 879 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Burden of Proof at Disposition Stage of Hearing. - Although the evidence supported the findings of abuse by the mother and failure to correct conditions which led to the removal of her children, the trial court erroneously placed the burden of proof on
                        the mother as to the best interests of the children at the dispositive stage of the hearing; therefore, the judgment had to be vacated as to the dispositional order and the case was remanded for a new dispositional hearing. In
                        re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 559 S.E.2d 237 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Show Progress Justified Termination. - Termination of the mother's parental rights based on the ground of failure to make reasonable progress was proper because she had not maintained stable employment for a minimum of six months; she failed
                        to obtain stable housing for at least six months as her frequent moves constituted evidence of housing instability, and she was days shy of having resided at her current residence for the designated six-month period of time; and
                        she failed to complete the recommended treatment needed to fully address the core issues of substance abuse and domestic violence which had played the largest roles in the children's removal. In re I.G.C.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 201</cite>, 835 S.E.2d 432 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Court properly terminated a father's parental rights because the father's choices and actions resulted in a lengthy delay in his projected release date from incarceration and significantly limited his access to classes, programs, services, and employment
                        which directly related to his case plan; there was no error in the trial court's findings of fact regarding the father's failures in accomplishing his case plan, most of which resulted from circumstances for which he was responsible.

                        which directly related to his case plan; there was no error in the trial court's findings of fact regarding the father's failures in accomplishing his case plan, most of which resulted from circumstances for which he was responsible.

                    <p>
                        Finding of Neglect. - Trial court properly terminated the father's parental rights on the ground that the father neglected the father's children, because the father expressed some interest in visitation rights, but only if a paternity test showed that
                        the father was one child's biological father. In re Mills, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 567 S.E.2d 166 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 672</cite>, 577 S.E.2d 627 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Order terminating the parental rights to the minor child was affirmed because respondents were the sole care providers for the child when the injury occurred and the father failed to acknowledge why his child entered Mecklenburg County Department of Social
                        Services custody, and he also failed to exhibit changed behaviors. In re Y.Y.E.T., <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 695 S.E.2d 517 (2010).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        District court's findings supported the conclusion that the father's parental rights were subject to termination as the child would likely be neglected again if the child were returned to the father's care because the mother struggled with basic parenting
                        skills and relied on the father as a main support for parenting; the father was willing to leave the child alone in the care of the mother even though the mother was unfit for such accountability; the parents continued to be in
                        constant marital discord even while having supervised visits with the child; and the parents intended to remain together despite the aforementioned problems. In re Z.V.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 207</cite>,
                        835 S.E.2d 425 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly terminated a father's parental rights based on neglect as there was no requirement that he be responsible for the prior adjudication of neglect, he made minimal efforts to show interest in the child while incarcerated, and the record
                        evidence showed that the father was responsible for his failure to satisfy his case plan's requirements. Moreover, the evidence supported the trial court's findings that the child was likely to be neglected if returned to the father's
                        care, the father was responsible for the lack of visitation, and his convictions and sentence were drug-related. In re S.D., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 67</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 315 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to the minor child and that it was in the child's best interests that the mother's parental rights be terminated because there was evidence in the record of past neglect and a probability of future
                        neglect, the mother's failure to complete her case plan supported the conclusion that she willfully left her child in foster care or a placement outside the home for over 12 months without making reasonable progress in correcting
                        the circumstances that led to the removal of the child, and her failure to comply with substance abuse and mental health treatment and to address domestic violence issues sufficiently demonstrated her lack of reasonable progress.

                        Findings Regarding Adoption. - Statute did not require the trial court to set forth detailed findings establishing the benchmarks a traumatized child had to meet to obtain the necessary stability to be adopted; on remand, the trial court only to make
                        findings of fact addressing the child's likelihood of adoption, and the challenged findings of fact were supported by competent record evidence and binding on appeal. In re S.M.M., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 911</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Trial court recognized that no evidence was presented regarding adoption and took judicial notice of the pending civil custody action filed by petitioners seeking custody of the children; trial court was not required to find a likelihood of adoption in
                        order for termination to be in the children's best interests. In re G.G.M., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                        Separate Hearings Not Required. - Although the court is required to apply different evidentiary standards at each of the two stages of adjudication and disposition, there is no requirement that the stages be conducted at two separate hearings. In re White,

                        Bifurcation of Hearing Not Required. - Hearing transcript showed the trial court heard dispositional evidence from a social worker and the guardian ad litem (GAL) and received the GAL's dispositional report into evidence; although the dispositional evidence
                        was intertwined with adjudicatory evidence, a trial court was not required to bifurcate the hearing into two distinct stages. In re S.M.M., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 911</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 8 (2020).

                        No Error in not Following Guardian Ad Litem's Recommendations. - As the trial court possessed the authority to weigh all of the evidence, the mere fact that the court elected not to follow the recommendation of the guardian ad litem did not constitute
                        error. In re A.U.D., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 3</cite>, 832 S.E.2d 698 (2019).

                        Children's Preference. - Adoption social worker who supervised the majority of the mother's visitations with the children testified that she did not see a bond, and the trial court was entitled to credit this testimony over any conflicting evidence; additionally,
                        in light of the trial court's uncontested finding of fact that the mother was incapable of raising her children, the fact that two of the children might have expressed a preference to return home was noteworthy but not determinative.

                    <p>
                        During the adjudicatory phase of a termination of parental rights proceeding, a trial court does not consider whether there is a relative who can take custody of the minor child, but focuses on whether there is evidence to support termination on the grounds
                        alleged in the petition, and if a fit relative were to come forward and declare their desire to have custody of the child, the court may consider this during the dispositional phase as grounds for why it would not be in the child's
                        best interests to terminate the parent's parental rights. In re J.A.A., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 623 S.E.2d 45 (2005).

                        Failure to Make Reasonable Progress. - Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper based on her willful failure to make reasonable progress because, inter alia, the mother voluntarily placed the children in the custody of the county department
                        of social services so that the father could live with her; and she failed to protect her children by allowing the father, who had assaulted her and two of the children, to return to the family home. In re A.R.A.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>, 835 S.E.2d 417 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Mother's rights were properly terminated as the evidence supported a finding that she had made no meaningful effort or progress toward resolving the substantial risk posed to the child by her lengthy history of relationships involving domestic violence.

                        Termination of Both Parents' Parental Rights. - Where the trial court properly concluded that grounds for termination existed, as set forth in former G.S. 7A-289.32(7), the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that it was in the best interests
                        of the child to terminate both parents' parental rights. In re Guynn, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 437 S.E.2d 532 (1993).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Termination of the parents' rights was in the children's best interests because adoption of each juvenile was likely; termination would aid in the permanent plan of adoption; the juveniles were bonded to their prospective foster parents; the foster parents
                        were providing for the juveniles' special needs; the proposed adoptive parents had agreed to allow the juveniles to visit with each other on a regular basis; and other factors outweighed the parents' strong bond with the eldest
                        child. In re A.H.F.S., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                    <p>
                        Termination of the both parents' rights was proper because the second eldest child's behavioral issues did not make adoption unlikely; a pre-adoptive home was interested in adopting him and his five siblings; and the mother failed to show that reasonable
                        progress had been made in correcting the conditions which led to the removal of the second eldest child and his siblings. In re S.M., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                        Termination of Parental Rights Supported by Child's Best Interests. - The respondent mother offered "nothing" upon which the trial court could reasonably base a decision to find it would not be in the child's best interests to terminate parental rights,
                        where although she proffered evidence claiming she had overcome her problems and achieved rehabilitation while in prison, enrolling in a cosmetology course there, frequently writing letters to her daughter, writing to petitioner
                        and the court asking them not to terminate her parental rights, and requesting visits with the child, she had been written up at least 11 times for disciplinary problems during her latest incarceration, including disobeying orders,
                        misusing medicine, theft of property, possessing non-threatening contraband and provoking an assault. In re Blackburn, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 607, 543 S.E.2d 906 (2001).

                    <p>
                        A trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that termination of a mother's parental rights to her daughter was in the child's best interests where: (1) numerous findings were made regarding the extensive sexual abuse the daughter suffered
                        at the hands of her brother and her stepfather; (2) where the mother acknowledged awareness of the abuse, but did virtually nothing to protect the daughter from it; (3) where the mother lacked insight regarding her own significant
                        mental health issues; (4) where the mother played a significant role in creating a neglectful and abusive home environment for the daughter, and (5) where the mother had made minimal progress in correcting the issues that led to
                        removal of the daughter from the mother's home. In re Dhermy, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 588 S.E.2d 555 (2003).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that it was in the best interests of the children under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite> that the mother's parental rights
                        be terminated; while the mother emphasized the strong bond with the children and that the mother made progress doing what the trial court ordered, the trial court was entitled to give greater weight to other evidence, including
                        the mother's repeated statements that the mother could not handle the responsibility of parenting the children. In re C.L.C., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 615 S.E.2d 704 (2005), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 475</cite>,

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was in a child's best interests to terminate a mother's parental rights where: (1) the mother failed to maintain stable housing, was unemployed, and failed to comply with a child support order,
                        (2) the mother had left the child with others, including an incident initiating the child's removal from her custody, (3) the mother had attempted suicide, had not cooperated with social workers, did not follow through with mental
                        health counseling, and did not complete parenting classes, (4) the mother only sporadically visited and contacted the child for over five years, (5) the child had been living with a guardian ad litem (GAL) for over five years and
                        considered the GAL's step-son her big brother, and (6) the mother had been aware of the GAL's intent to adopt the child for three years, yet her personal situation had not improved or stabilized. In re E.T.S.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 623 S.E.2d 300 (2005).

                    <p>
                        At the dispositional stage, a court is required to issue an order of termination unless it determines that the best interests of the child require that the parental rights of such parent not be terminated; a trial court did not err in refusing to conclude
                        that termination was not in the best interests of the child where it found, inter alia, that the father was a convicted sex offender who violated his parole and was returned to prison while the child was in the custody of Department
                        of Social Services, that the father was permitted only supervised visits with the child, was forbidden to reside in the same house with the child, and was ordered to complete sex offender treatment, which he failed to do. In re

                        Termination of the mother's parental rights was in the best interest of the child where, inter alia, the mother demonstrated no ability to establish a safe and stable home for the child, despite repeated offers of funding and logistical assistance from
                        petitioner Durham County Department of Social Services. In re L.A.B., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 295, 631 S.E.2d 61 (2006).

                        (2) the child's foster parents hoped to adopt the child; (3) the foster parents were of good health and good character, and their adoption of the child would likely be approved; and (4) the child was a healthy child with no significant
                        behavioral or physical problems that would hamper the child's adoption. In re T.M., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 643 S.E.2d 471 (2007).

                        the trial court in its discretion, properly considered the factors enumerated in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite> in finding that the child was bonded to his foster parents
                        and that given the age of the child returning the child to respondent would not have been in the child's best interest, and that the child had not developed as many illnesses in foster care as when in the mother's custody and that
                        the child's current placement was appropriate and was in the best interest of the child. In re R.B.B., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 639, 654 S.E.2d 514 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 235</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Termination order was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence based on the mother's unfitness to have custody, and the overwhelming evidence of neglect, including improper supervision of her children, inappropriate discipline, and the severely
                        unsanitary condition of the family's home due to the many different farm animals living therein, as well as a roach infestation. Further, given evidence of the significant positive progress that the children made since they were
                        taken from the mother's custody, termination was in the children's best interests. In re J.A.P., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 659 S.E.2d 14 (2008).

                        Termination of the father's parental rights was in the best interest of the children where the evidence showed that the four-year old had been in the custody of the Department of Social Services for three years, suffered from a medical condition that
                        required frequent medical visits and a monitored diet, and had bonded with the child's foster family; that the older child had bonded with the child's placement family, had improved the child's grades, and was participated in therapy
                        on a regular basis; and the father did not demonstrate an understanding of the needs of either child. In re N.A.L., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 666 S.E.2d 768 (2008).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was in a child's best interests to terminate a mother's parental rights because there was abundant evidence of the mother's violent and inconsistent behavior and her inability to parent appropriately
                        and follow the recommendations of medical personnel to improve her mental health and parenting abilities; the child was young and had been in the custody of the Department of Social Services almost her whole life, and she needed
                        permanency. In re I.T.P-L, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 670 S.E.2d 282 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 581</cite>, 681 S.E.2d 783 (2009).

                        Trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law supported its determination that it was in a child's best interests to terminate a mother's parental rights because the trial court's order contained findings of fact as to the child's age, how long
                        the child had been in foster care, and the likelihood of his being adopted by the relative placement; the findings reflected that the child had been placed with a maternal aunt since birth, had never lived with the mother, and
                        was doing well in the placement with the aunt, and that his needs were being met and the aunt was interested in adopting him. In re D.D., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (June 16, 2009).

                        the mother failed to attend hearings concerning the minor child, the minor child had formed a bond with his paternal grandparents, and they had taken care of his special needs by taking him to appointments with various specialists.

                        Where the record showed that a father had abandoned his two minor daughters, termination of his parental rights was in the children's best interests under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>                        because the father had not shown any intention or desire to meet the girls' needs or assume the duties of a father, and the wife's new husband wanted to adopt them and he had assumed the duties of a father.

                        Although the biological father argued that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding it was in the best interest of the minor child to terminate the biological father's parental rights because the biological father's mother was willing to take
                        custody of the minor child and it was unclear whether the minor child's foster parent would be able to adopt the minor child, the court found that nothing within <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>                        required that termination lead to adoption in order for termination to be in a child's best interests, and the biological father had not taken any actions in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(5)</a></cite>                        exhibiting a parental interest in the minor child, which provided grounds for termination of his parental rights.

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining it was in the best interest of a child that the parental rights of the child's parent were to be terminated because the court found that: (1) the child was eight years old; (2) adoption was very
                        likely as the child was living with a foster family that wanted to adopt the child as soon as legally possible; (3) termination of parental rights would accomplish the permanent plan of adoption; (4) although the child had a bond
                        with the parent, the child had indicated to the child's therapist that the child did not wish to return to the parent's custody; and (5) the child had bonded with the child's foster family, which had been meeting the child's needs
                        and providing the love and support expected of a family. In re D.J.E.L., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 701 S.E.2d 1 (2010), review denied 706 S.E.2d 232, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 40 (2011).

                        Trial court did not err in concluding that it was in the best interests of a father's son to terminate the father's parental rights, as the trial court's findings of fact showed that the son lived with his mother and her current husband, that he had a
                        close relationship with his stepsister, that the mother and her husband were actively involved with the son's extracurricular activity, that the mother and her husband had been the sole source of parental care for the child for
                        the past ten years, that the father had not been a part of the child's school or extracurricular activities, that the child was well-adjusted, that the father was incarcerated for a crime of violence, and that the nine-year-old
                        child last saw the father when he was five years old. In re A.J.M.P., <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 695 S.E.2d 156 (2010).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in concluding that termination was in the best interests of the children because the enumerated findings demonstrated the trial court considered the children's likelihood of adoption. In re H.D., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                        318, 768 S.E.2d 860 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding termination of a mother's parental rights was in the best interests of the children because documentary evidence produced by the children's guardian ad litem noted that with therapy, the children would
                        be able to be adopted; the trial court's order did contain a finding addressing the children's behavioral issues, and the trial court found that with continued therapeutic treatment, the likelihood of their adoption remained high.

                        Court did not err in deeming it likely that the grandparents would adopt the child, and it did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the child's best interests would be served by terminating the mother's parental rights because the grandparents
                        did not lack the ability to obtain standing to adopt the child as they were the child's grandparents and legal custodians; they had raised the child since he was 18 months old; they wished to adopt him; by all accounts, the child
                        was thriving in the grandparents' home; and the child's guardian ad litem recommended the termination of the mother's and the father's parental rights in order to facilitate the child's adoption by the grandparents. In re D.E.M.,

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that termination of the mother's parental rights was in the children's best interest, as, contrary to the mother's assertion, the trial court did consider the mother's progress toward sobriety but
                        noted that she had been incarcerated for all but a few days of the time and the trial court also considered the child's bond with the mother and other relatives. In re T.H., - N.C. App. - , 832 S.E.2d 162 (2019).

                        Trial court's conclusion that termination of a father's parental rights was in the children's best interests did not constitute an abuse of discretion where the trial court appropriately considered the factors stated in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>,
                        and its determination that other factors outweighed the father's strong bond with the children was not manifestly unsupported by reason given their strong bond with their foster parents, the strong likelihood of adoption, and the
                        father's lack of progress in addressing his substance abuse, domestic violence, and mental health. In re Z.L.W., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 432</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 62 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Termination of the mother's parental rights was in the son's best interest as he had a strong bond with his current foster family and was forming a long-term attachment to them; he was receiving structure and stability from the foster family; he needed
                        permanence and continued therapy; and the mother was no longer participating in his therapy and had not called to inquire about his welfare. In re A.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>, 835 S.E.2d

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion when determining that terminating the parents' rights was in the juveniles' best interests, finding that other factors outweighed the parents' strong bond with the juveniles, including that termination was necessary
                        to achieve the primary permanent plan, the children were in a preadoptive home with their maternal grandparents, the children and the grandparents were well bonded, and the children would likely be adopted. In re Z.A.M.,

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was in the children's best interests to terminate a mother's parental rights because the trial court thoroughly considered the children's developmental challenges and their likelihood of adoption
                        based on the children's then placement and potential future adoptive parents. Furthermore, there was testimony that the children were thriving and showing great improvement developmentally in their placements. In re J.H.,

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly terminated a father's parental rights in his son because the son's potential placement with a relative was not a factor it was required to consider or make findings about during the dispositional phase of the termination of parental
                        rights proceeding; the trial court determined that the child's best interests would be served by remaining in the custody of the county department of health and human services rather than being placed with a relative. In re S.D.C.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 285</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 854 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's findings demonstrate that it considered the best interest factors and determined that the child's young age, lack of any bond with the father, and need for consistency, combined with the father's lack of involvement with the child, supported
                        a finding that termination was in the child's best interests. In re C.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 42</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 742 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Termination of the father's rights was in the child's best interests; given his abandonment of the child for several years before the mother filed her petition, the father's conduct indicated he would not promote the child's physical and emotional well-being,
                        plus the child considered the mother's husband as her only father. In re K.N.K., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 50</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 735 (2020).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the child's best interests would be served by terminating the father's parental rights because it found that the stepfather wished to adopt the child, the child indicated he wanted to be adopted
                        by the stepfather, the child had very little recollection of his father, the father had a lengthy history of assaultive behavior against the mother, and he had been involved in criminal activity for the majority of the child's
                        life. In re J.T.C., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 18, 2020).

                    <p>
                        Termination of a father's parental rights was in the child's bests interests where the current placement providers had expressed an interest in adoption. In re J.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 772</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 44 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Termination of the mother's parental rights was in the children's best interests where a finding of high likelihood of adoption was supported by the social worker's testimony. In re M.A., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 865</cite>,
                        844 S.E.2d 916 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contrary to the mother's assertion, leaving her sons in their current foster placements with periodic visitation by her was not working as a plan; this arrangement was not only contrary to the permanent plan established by the trial court, it also served
                        to deny the children the prospect of a safe, permanent home within a reasonable amount of time as contemplated by the Juvenile Code. Termination of the mother's parental rights was affirmed. In re J.S.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 811</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 66 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's conclusion that termination of the parents' parental rights was in the children's best interests did not constitute an abuse of discretion because the court appropriately considered the statutory factors when determining the children's best
                        interests and the court's finding that the parents' strong bond with the children was outweighed by other factors was not manifestly unsupported by reason. Trial court also found that the parents were not in a position to provide
                        adequate care for the children who were in preadoptive placement. In re J.J.B., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 787</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 1 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's conclusion that termination of a mother's parental rights was in the child's best interests did not constitute an abuse of discretion because it properly considered the statutory factors; the trial court found that the conduct of the mother
                        and father demonstrated that they would not promote the child's health, physical, and mental well-being and that the child was no closer to returning home than she was on the day she entered into the care of the department of social
                        services. In re N.G., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 891</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 16 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's decision that it was in a child's best interests to terminate the mother's parental rights was not an abuse of its discretion as a social worker testified that the bond between the mother and the child during supervised visitations was similar
                        to that of playmates, while the quality of the relationship between the child and the proposed adoptive parent was similar to that of parent and child. The court also did not relegate the decision of whether to terminate parental
                        rights to a decision between the mother and the foster parent. In re A.B.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 752</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 902 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dispositional findings showed that the trial court considered all of the relevant <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite> criteria and made a reasoned determination that termination
                        of parental rights was in the children's best interests given the parents' failure to make progress in addressing their ability to deal with the children's needs, the children's relative youth, the likelihood of adoption, and the
                        children's need for permanence after more than five years in state custody. In re I.N.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 542</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 214 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to her child for neglect, willful failure to correct the conditions that led to the child's removal from her home, failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of the child's care while the
                        child was in DSS custody, and as in the child's best interest because the trial court made sufficient dispositional findings regarding the child's bond with her maternal grandmother and half-brother in light of the evidence before
                        it, considered the relevant statutory criteria, and weighed the competing goals of preserving the child's ties to her biological family and achieving permanence for the child through adoption. In re S.J.B., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d
                        - (Sept. 25, 2020).

                    <p>
                        Termination of parental rights was appropriate because the trial court's dispositional findings demonstrated that it considered the statutory criteria and made a reasoned determination that termination of a mother's parental rights was in a child's best
                        interests as the court made findings concerning the child's age, the likelihood of adoption, whether termination would aid in accomplishing the permanent plan of adoption, and the mother's bond with the child. The lack of a proposed
                        adoptive placement for the child was not a bar to termination. In re C.B., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Termination of mother's rights was in the children's best interests; adoptability of the children alone was not dispositive, they had been in foster care for 13 months, one child had no bond with mother, and while the other child did have a bond, other
                        factors outweighed this, and termination was necessary to achieve permanence. In re H.A.J., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                        Trial court made findings regarding the children's ages, the pending civil custody action, the children's lack of a bond with father after his five and one-half year absence, the children's close and loving relationship with their grandparents, who had
                        provided for all of the children's needs, and the negative impact on the children from father's sudden return into their lives; termination was in the children's best interests. In re G.G.M., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                        Trial court appropriately exercised its discretion to weigh the statutory factors to properly conclude that it was in the best interests of a mother's children to terminate the parental rights of the mother. While the considered the bond between the children
                        and the mother, the court noted the mother's not provide healthy parental boundaries, the age of each child, and the safe and secure placement of the children with a caregiver who intended to adopt the children. In re A.M., - N.C.

                        Construction. - Father's claim that the amended version of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite> required a trial court to determine the "worthiness" of the grounds for termination
                        found in the adjudication stage of the proceedings when making its discretionary decision in the dispositional phase lacked merit. In re C.I.M., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 342, 715 S.E.2d 247 (2011).

                        was in the best interests of the children, as it considered the statutory factors in making that determination after it found sufficient evidence to support the grounds for termination. In re C.I.M., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite>                        342, 715 S.E.2d 247 (2011).

                        while the court was required to consider all six listed factors, it was not required to make written findings with respect to all six factors; the court had to enter written findings in its order concerning only those factors that
                        were relevant. In re D.H., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 217, 753 S.E.2d 732 (2014).

                        the absence of an adoptive placement was not a bar to terminating the mother's parental rights. In re D.H., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 217, 753 S.E.2d 732 (2014).

                        Trial court's order shows a well-reasoned weighing of the child's adoptability and the obstacles thereto, along with her age, lack of appropriate bond with the mother, and need for permanency; the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding
                        that termination of the mother's rights was in the child's best interests. In re S.M.M., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 911</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 8 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that termination of parental rights was in a child's best interests because the court's dispositional findings demonstrated that it considered the relevant statutory criteria and gave due consideration
                        to the child's age, the likelihood of adoption, whether termination would facilitate in the achievement of the permanent plan, the child's bond with the child's parents, and the quality of the relationship between the child and
                        the foster placement. In re A.J.T., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 504</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 192 (2020).

                        Refusal to Dismiss Petition. - The trial court did not err in refusing to exercise its discretion under former G.S. 7A-289.31 (see now this section), which authorizes the court to dismiss a petition to terminate a parent's rights despite the existence
                        of grounds for termination. Furthermore, the court was not required to find facts for this refusal. In re Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 330 S.E.2d 513 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Evidence Sufficient to Support Termination. - Ample evidence supported the three statutory grounds for termination of the mother's parental rights found by the trial court, including that the mother failed to show an ability to properly parent the children
                        by using the skills that had been taught in the various programs that the mother attended. In re C.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 644 S.E.2d 630 (2007).

                    <p>
                        In a case in which a mother argued on appeal that the factual findings made by a district court did not support the conclusion that termination of her parental rights was in the best interests of the juvenile, the district court's uncontested findings
                        demonstrated that it properly considered the required factors listed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>. The termination of her parental rights
                        furthered the plan of adoption; the district court found that the juvenile was in need of a stable and permanent environment and that terminating the mother's parental rights was a step toward giving the juvenile a stable and permanent
                        environment. In re S.T.P., <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 689 S.E.2d 223 (2010).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Findings fully supported the trial court's conclusion that grounds existed to terminate a mother's parental rights based upon her willful failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care during the children's placement in county department of social
                        services custody because the mother was on notice of her failure to pay something towards the cost of care for her children; the trial court repeatedly found in its permanency planning orders that none of the parents were paying
                        child support. In re S.E., - N.C. - , 838 S.E.2d 328 (2020).

                    <p>
                        The evidence supported a finding that termination of parental rights was in the best interest of the child; while there were perceived improvements in respondent's mental condition, the evidence tended to show that after almost two years of diligent efforts
                        by DSS, respondent was not able to demonstrate that she could adequately provide for her child's needs, and testimony by one expert as to the negative effect of any further delay on a permanent placement of the child, given his
                        age and close bond to his foster family, was particularly persuasive. In re Brim, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 535 S.E.2d 367 (2000).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's findings were supported by evidence that the mother left her three children in foster care for over a year without showing reasonable progress; her fourth child's treatment and status were clearly relevant to show neglect. In re Johnston,
                        <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 728, 567 S.E.2d 219 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating a father's parental rights because grounds for termination existed under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(5)</a></cite> where,
                        in the three-and-a-half years since the mother told the father that she was pregnant and that he was the father, and until the mother contacted him about child support, the father had expressed no interest in discovering whether
                        the mother had given birth, in determining whether the child was his, or in taking responsibility for the child. In re T.L.B., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 605 S.E.2d 249 (2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were sufficient findings to support the termination of parental rights order, including the fact that the father failed to propose an alternate replacement to take care of the children, that the father failed to provide any contact, love, or affection
                        for the children, and that the father failed to attempt to contact the children while he was incarcerated. In re D.J.D., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 615 S.E.2d 26 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's decision to award custody of the children to their biological father, to limit the mother's visits with the children by requiring them to be supervised, and to prohibit any contact between the children and the stepfather, was plainly the
                        result of a reasoned decision guided by the clear best interests of these juveniles, as the evidence showed that, inter alia, the mother "thumped" the five-year-old in the face hard enough to leave a finger-shaped bruise, the stepfather
                        hit the younger child with a brush hard enough to leave a large bruise, respondents attempted to convince the younger child to lie, and the mother admitted that she left the younger child alone in the bathtub every night for 20
                        to 30 minutes. In re L.T.R., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 639 S.E.2d 122 (2007).

        Evidence Properly Considered.
       </b> - Trial court considered the testimony of the guardian ad litem and the therapist, determined their testimony was credible, and made an independent finding regarding the children's bond with father based on that testimony,

                        The court did not err in issuing a written order terminating respondent's parental rights which contained language not included in its recital in open court where the findings about which respondent complained related to the "adjudication" by the trial
                        court, pursuant to the provisions of former G.S. 7A-289.32, that grounds for termination of respondent's parental rights existed at the time of the hearing, not to the court's "disposition" pursuant to former G.S. 7A-289.31, and
                        where the order entered by the trial court was in "general conformity" to the disposition announced in open court. In re Brim, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 535 S.E.2d 367 (2000).

                        Order terminating a father's parental rights was reversed, where the trial court entered its order more than five months after the conclusion of the termination hearing; the late entry of the written order was a clear and egregious violation of
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>.

                    <p>
                        When a trial court took a best interests determination under advisement at the end of a termination hearing, the trial court abused its discretion in denying the mother's motion to re-open the evidence because, at the time of the mother's motion, the
                        court had not yet made the best interests determination required to terminate the mother's parental rights <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>;
                        the mother filed her motion on April 12, 2012, the trial court heard and orally denied the motion on April 17, 2012, and the order terminating parental rights was entered on April 18, 2012. In re B.S.O., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite>                        541, 740 S.E.2d 483 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Tax Costs in Award - Where the father sought to terminate the mother's parental rights and sought child support, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(e)</a></cite>, the trial
                        court could not award attorney's fees to the mother for the termination of parental rights portion of the trial without taxing the costs to the father, which it failed to do. Burr v. Burr, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite>                        504, 570 S.E.2d 222 (2002).

                    <p>
                        An order terminating parental rights is a "nullity" when signed by a judge other than the one who presided over the hearing. In re Savage, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 195, 592 S.E.2d 610 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Delay in Entering Termination Order Requires Prejudice for Reversal. - Trial court erred by not entering its termination order within the statutory time frame, but reversal was not required since the parents did not show how they were prejudiced by the
                        delay. In re D.R., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 300, 616 S.E.2d 300 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Delay in Filing Termination Order. - Father was required to show prejudice from a trial court's delay in filing its termination order, but his sole argument was that the five-month delay prejudiced him by the delay of his right to appeal and to achieve
                        finality in the relationship with his daughter before he faced a potentially long incarceration; in light of the father's continuous incarceration since before the termination hearing, there was insufficient prejudice to warrant
                        a new trial. In re S.B.M., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 634, 619 S.E.2d 583 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's failure to timely enter its adjudication and disposition order in a termination of parental rights action did not warrant reversal because that would only further delay the determination regarding the children's custody in opposition to
                        the intent of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>. In

                    <p>
                        Trial court reversibly erred in failing to enter an order terminating a mother's parental rights over her children until over 180 days after the termination hearing, in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>, because the long delay was highly prejudicial to the mother, the children, and the foster parent. In re L.E.B., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite>                        375, 610 S.E.2d 424 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights because its order was internally inconsistent and thus, unreviewable; there were contradictory findings as to the mother's mental health care and her domestic violence issues, and the factor
                        of financial assistance to potential adoptive parents seemed to outweigh the close emotional bonds between the mother and children and her efforts to regain custody. In re A.B., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                        157, 768 S.E.2d 573 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Order Internally Inconsistent. - Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights because the contradictory nature of its findings of fact and conclusions of law prohibited the court of appeals from adequately determining if they supported
                        its conclusions of law that the mother failed to make reasonable progress toward correcting the conditions that led to the removal of the children from her care and custody and terminating her parental rights was in the children's
                        best interests. In re A.B., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 157, 768 S.E.2d 573 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Order Preferring Child's Adoption by Foster Parents to Placement With Relatives. - It was not an abuse of discretion, in a termination of parental rights proceeding, for a trial court to find that the subject child's adoption by the child's foster parents
                        better served the child's best interests than placement of the child with the child's relatives because the court (1) made findings regarding the relevant provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110(a)</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1100" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1100</a></cite>, (2) made extensive findings as to the relative situations of the foster parents and the child's relatives, and (3) specifically provided the
                        court's reasons for determining that the child's best interests would be served by termination of parental rights and subsequent adoption by the child's foster parents, finding the foster parents had provided the child with a safe,
                        stable, home, and the relatives did not timely present themselves in a reasonable time to provide the child a safe permanent home. In re D.R.F., <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 693 S.E.2d 235 (2010), review denied,

                    <p>
                        Motion to Reopen on Remand Properly Denied. - Mere speculation that some facts might have changed in the 18 months since the trial court originally heard evidence was insufficient to show the trial court abused its discretion in denying the mother's motion
                        to reopen on remand; the trial court was able to make the required findings concerning the likelihood of the child's adoption from the evidence originally presented and the new findings satisfied the appellate court's mandate.

                            Subject Matter Jurisdiction. - Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over a case involving termination of a mother's parental rights to her son, and the trial court did not err in denying the mother's motion to stay the termination proceeding pending
                            resolution of her appeal of a prior custody order, because case law established that the trial court retained jurisdiction to terminate parental rights during the pendency of the custody order appeal and, where a termination
                            order is entered while a prior custody order is pending, the termination order necessarily renders the pending appeal moot. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 616 S.E.2d 264

                            Trial court had jurisdiction to terminate a mother's parental rights because it had jurisdiction over the underlying neglect and dependency action and issued a valid custody order to the county department of social services, giving it standing to file
                            the petitions for termination of parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1103ol1a3" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1103(a)(3)</a></cite>; a summons was issued a day after the juvenile
                            petitions were filed, and although the mother was not served with the summonses until after their expiration, she made a general appearance in the action before the trial court at the non-secure custody hearings, thereby waiving
                            any objection to personal jurisdiction. In re S'N.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 581, 686 S.E.2d 917 (2009).

                            Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant a mother's petition to terminate respondent's parental rights pursuant to this section; the trial court erred in concluding that an Indiana court relinquished jurisdiction to North Carolina's courts
                            by entering an order in the Indiana Action dismissing the paternal grandparents' motion for visitation rights. In re J.D., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 342, 759 S.E.2d 375 (2014).

                            Father failed to show that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to terminate his parental rights where it was undisputed that the child's mother, the father, and the child no longer resided in Delaware when the county department of social
                            services (DSS) filed the juvenile petition, and initial information that the child did not reside in North Carolina was superseded by more accurate information that the child had resided in the state for more than six months
                            before DSS filed the juvenile petition. Thus, North Carolina was the child's home state. In re L.T., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 567</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 199 (2020).

                            to eliminate the requirement that the Department of Social Services provide services to a parent before termination of parental rights can occur; thus a determination that the department made diligent efforts to provide services
                            to a parent is no longer a condition precedent to terminating parental rights. In re Frasher, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 555 S.E.2d 379 (2001).

                            pursuant to former G.S. 7A-289.32(7), for the evidence to be sufficient in a former G.S. 7A-657 review hearing to evince a lack of ability to perform mentally that impedes a parent's child care decisions. In re Reinhardt,

                            of the excluded testimony; the trial court, after having heard and considered the mother's proffered information at a prior hearing, did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the mother's proffer at the disposition hearing.

                            Proceeding for termination of parental rights requires the trial court to conduct a two part inquiry; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite> directs that the court first shall
                            take evidence, find the facts, and shall adjudicate the existence or nonexistence of any of the circumstances set forth in this section, which authorize the termination of parental rights of the respondent. Disposition is governed

                            Where the court merely recited the testimony of witnesses and did not make the required findings of fact, further findings of fact and a determination of the father's parental fitness was needed if he was to be denied all contact with his daughter. Moore

                            Termination of parental rights proceeding is a two-stage process: the trial court first determines whether sufficient grounds exist under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite> to
                            warrant termination; if the trial court determines that any one of the grounds for termination listed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite> exists, the trial court may then terminate
                            parental rights consistent with the best interests of the child. In re T.D.P., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 595 S.E.2d 735 (2004), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 405</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 199 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Allowing the trial court to terminate the mother's parental rights during the pendency of the custody review order appeal did not prejudice the mother's rights, as the termination proceedings required that a ground for termination under
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite> be established and the proceedings afforded the mother an opportunity to challenge the termination order on appeal under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1113" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1113</a></cite>.
                            In re R.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 539</cite>, 614 S.E.2d 489 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Termination of the mother's parental rights was upheld because the unchallenged grounds for termination of the mother's parental rights supported the trial court's termination order. In re J.M.W., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite>                            788, 635 S.E.2d 916 (2006).

                        <p>
                            Trial court's order terminating a mother's parental rights was proper based on findings that the older of the two children was abused and neglected, the younger child was neglected, the mother willfully abandoned the children for six consecutive months
                            preceding the filing of the petition, the mother left the children in foster care for more than 12 months without showing that reasonable progress had been made to correct the conditions that led to the children's removal,
                            the children were dependent, and the mother committed and was convicted of a felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury to the older child. In re T.J.D.W., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                            394, 642 S.E.2d 471 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 568</cite>, 651 S.E.2d 562 (2007).

                            in the termination petition. In re S.R.G., <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 671 S.E.2d 47 (2009).

                            Findings of fact, focusing on what occurred through early 2007, did not explain why the trial court reached its determination that the parents' efforts in 2006 through April 2008 - the date of the filing of the petition giving rise to the order on appeal
                            - did not amount to reasonable progress; while petitioner mother's brother focused on evidence of domestic violence and alcohol consumption in 2008, the trial court made no findings of fact as to that evidence, but discussed
                            incidents that occurred in early 2006. Without findings as to the reasonableness, adequacy, or inadequacy of the 2006 through 2008 efforts, the court could not determine that the trial court's conclusions were supported by
                            its findings of fact. In re F.G.J., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 681, 684 S.E.2d 745 (2009).

                            Trial court's conclusion that one statutory ground for termination existed was sufficient in and of itself to support termination of a father's parental rights; as such, the supreme court did not need not to address the father's arguments regarding another
                            ground for termination. In re O.W.D.A., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                            Failure to Give Notice of Grounds for Termination. - Because the trial court erred in allowing the county department of social services to amend the petitions to terminate a mother's parental rights to conform to the evidence, the original petitions failed
                            to put the mother on notice that <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite> would be a possible ground to support termination, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                            N.C. R. Civ. P. 15(b) did not apply, the termination order was reversed. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 660 S.E.2d 255 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 674</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 320

                            Obligation of Trial Court to Consider Best Interests. - Having adjudicated the father's willful abandonment of the child, the trial court was obliged to determine whether it was in the child's best interests to terminate the father's parental rights,

                            issues raised on appeal with respect to other termination grounds did not have to be addressed. In re K.O., <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite> 420, 735 S.E.2d 369 (2012).

                            Mother challenges four of the trial court's findings of fact as unsupported, but as the challenged findings were not necessary to support the trial court's conclusion that she willfully left the child in foster care for more than 12 months without making
                            reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to her removal, the challenged findings did not need to be reviewed on appeal. In re C.J., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 260</cite>, 837 S.E.2d

                            Pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>, as the trial court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights on at least one ground for termination, an appellate
                            court did not need to address the mother's arguments regarding the other grounds. In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 737 S.E.2d 182 (2013).

                            There was a sufficient basis in the record for terminating the father's parental rights that had nothing to do with poverty; his failure to obtain custody appeared primarily to have been the result of his own inaction, and thus poverty could not have
                            been the sole reason for terminating his parental rights. In re A.W, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 765 S.E.2d 111 (2014).

                            Dual Burden of Proof Where Child Was American Indian. - Where a minor child's status as a Native American made a termination proceeding under this Article also subject to the provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.), the federal
                            provision did not require that the North Carolina statutory grounds to terminate parental rights be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, a dual burden of proof was created in which the state provisions and federal provisions
                            had to be satisfied separately; i.e., the state grounds for termination had to be supported by clear and convincing evidence, while the federal law required evidence which justified termination beyond a reasonable doubt. In
                            re Bluebird, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite> 42, 411 S.E.2d 820 (1992).

                            Separate Hearings Not Required. - Although the court is required to apply different evidentiary standards at each of the two stages of adjudication and disposition, there is no requirement that the stages be conducted at two separate hearings. In re White,

                            The welfare or best interest of the child is always to be treated as the paramount consideration to which even parental love must yield. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).

                            Although severing parental ties is a harsh judicial remedy, the best interests of the children must be considered paramount. Herrell v. Adcock, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 222, 316 S.E.2d 347 (1984).

                            Upon a finding that grounds exist to authorize termination, the trial court is never required to terminate parental rights under any circumstances, but is merely given the discretion to do so. In re Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite>                            411, 333 S.E.2d 554 (1985).

                            But Has Discretionary Authority to Do So. - The court has the authority to terminate parental rights in the exercise of its discretion.

                            When the district court concluded that child was neglected, it was within the court's discretion, taking into account the best interests of the child, as to whether parental rights should be terminated. In re Webb, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite>                            345, 320 S.E.2d 306 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 322</cite>, 327 S.E.2d 879 (1985).

                            Former G.S. 7A-289.30 and G.S. 7A-289.31, when read together, mean that in the adjudication stage, the petitioner must prove clearly, cogently, and convincingly the existence of one or more of the grounds for termination listed in this section. Once the
                            petitioner has proven this ground by this standard, it has met its burden within the statutory scheme of former G.S. 7A-289.30 and 7A-289.31. The petitioner having met his burden of proof at the adjudication stage, the court
                            then moves on to the disposition stage, where the court's decision to terminate parental rights is discretionary. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).

                            as to whether to terminate parental rights is discretionary. In re White, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 344 S.E.2d 36, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 283</cite>, 347

                            20-year history of substance abuse, was reversed; the trial court failed to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the father's interests as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101(1)</a></cite>,
                            and regardless of whether that failure prejudiced the father, remand was required for appointment of a guardian ad litem and for rehearing. In re S.B., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 602 S.E.2d 691 (2004).

                            Order terminating a father's parental rights was improper because it did not identify any <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)</a></cite> grounds for termination and did not indicate
                            the evidentiary standard under which the trial court made its adjudicatory findings of fact; without an identified basis for adjudication, effective review of the termination order was precluded, and without a finding of willfulness,
                            there was insufficient basis for a finding of abandonment, and the father's incarceration alone was insufficient to support the termination order. Bolick v. Brizendine (In re D.R.B.), <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                            733, 643 S.E.2d 77 (2007).

                            Order terminating a father's parental rights was vacated because the trial court failed to make specific findings of fact or to state in its conclusions of law that the father's actions were willful, and, thus the findings did not conclusively establish
                            grounds for termination of parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)</a></cite>; without an identified basis for the adjudication

                            of the order; when, the trial court relies upon a single ground to terminate parental rights, the presence or absence of a required finding of fact must be substantive within the scope of that order. In re C.N.C.B., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite>                            553, 678 S.E.2d 240 (2009).

                            because the order contained no finding of fact that the mother lacked an appropriate alternative child care arrangement. In re C.N.C.B., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 678 S.E.2d 240 (2009).

                            Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights to her child on the ground that the mother failed to make reasonable progress because the evidence indicated that her criminal matter would be disposed of quite soon; no evidence showed that
                            the mother acted in any way to delay the criminal matters or done anything other than follow her attorney's instructions. In re S.D., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 65, 776 S.E.2d 862

                            Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights to her child on the ground that the mother failed to make reasonable progress because while the mother could benefit from more frequent treatment, the evidence showed that she complied with the
                            frequency of treatment required of her. In re S.D., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 65, 776 S.E.2d 862 (2015).

                            Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights to her child on the ground that the mother failed to make reasonable progress because a factor that could support the trial court's conclusion was the mother's meager income, but poverty alone
                            could not be a basis for termination of parental rights. In re S.D., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 65, 776 S.E.2d 862 (2015).

                        <p>
                            Evidence was sufficient to support termination of parental rights, where mother did not attend any counseling sessions, had three criminal convictions, failed to attend some of the scheduled visits with the children, and willfully paid no child support.

                            Termination of a father's parental rights was supported by evidence which showed that the father's history of domestic violence toward the child's mother led to the child's removal, that the father agreed to participation in a domestic violence program
                            but failed to complete that program, and failed to show that different counseling he participated in addressed the domestic violence issue.

                            The Department of Social Services provided sufficient evidence to withstand motion to dismiss termination proceedings, where the father willfully left the minor children in foster care for more than 18 months and the father had been incarcerated two times
                            during the period that the children were in foster care. In re Becker, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 85, 431 S.E.2d 820 (1993).

                            Evidence concerning respondent's actions after the petition was filed was clearly relevant to determine the existence of the factors justifying termination under this section; in cases concerning termination of parental rights based upon neglect, the

                            Trial court erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for a mother in an action to terminate her parental rights; under the version of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101</a></cite>                            in effect when the petition was filed, a guardian was required where it was alleged that the mother was physically disabled pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite>.
                            In re D.S.C., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 607 S.E.2d 43 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Although the mother's parental rights were not terminated for dependency under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite>, the trial court erred in failing to appoint the
                            mother a guardian ad litem under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101</a></cite>; the guardian ad litem requirement was triggered because the mother's mental health issues, involving,
                            in part, bipolar disorder, were central to the termination. In re L.W., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 623 S.E.2d 626 (2006), review denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 534</cite>, 633

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred when it failed to appoint a guardian ad litem for mother pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1101</a></cite> after reviewing her psychological evaluation, but still
                            considered her mental illness, even though it never mentioned <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite> as a factor in terminating her parental rights. Accordingly, the mother
                            was entitled to a new termination hearing and the appointment of a guardian ad litem. In re T.W., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 153, 617 S.E.2d 702 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err by not appointing a guardian ad litem for the mother for a termination of parental rights hearing as it was not alleged, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite>,
                            that the mother was incapable of properly caring for her children; additionally, whether the trial court should have appointed a guardian ad litem for the mother in a prior dependency proceeding was not an issue before the
                            court on the appeal of the termination of the mother's parental rights. In re O.C., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 457, 615 S.E.2d 391 (2005), cert. denied, - N.C. - , 623 S.E.2d 587 (2005).

                        <p>
                            While the termination of a mother's parental rights was based on <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1)</a></cite>, (7), the original petition alleged grounds for termination pursuant
                            to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite>, and the trial court considered the mother's substance abuse and mental illness in making that determination; therefore,G.S.
                            7B-1101 required appointment of a guardian ad litem for the mother, and the failure of the trial court to do so was error. In re K.R.S., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 613 S.E.2d 318 (2005).

                            Testimony of Guardian Ad Litem Appointed for a Parent Was Properly Admitted. - Guardian ad litem appointed for mentally incompetent mother could not be prevented from testifying on issues that were against the mother's interests either on direct testimony
                            for the department of social services or if she were testifying on behalf of the mother and the information were being elicited on cross examination. In re Shepard, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>                            215, 591 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

                            Earlier decision setting aside termination order did not "void" basis of subsequent adoption proceeding or earlier termination proceeding, but simply held that termination order had to be set aside since service on putative father was void. In re Clark,
                            <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 381 S.E.2d 835 (1989).

                            Father's contention that mother should be estopped from petitioning to terminate his parental rights because she knew the grounds for termination and concealed that knowledge from him was completely without merit. In re Hunt,

                            Putative Father Not Precluded from Asserting Rights. - Where termination order, later held to be invalid for failure to use due diligence in ascertaining the putative father's address, was filed with an adoption petition in lieu of the affidavit required
                            by former G.S. 48-13, a subsequently filed affidavit did not relate back to the original filing date of the petition so as to cut off the rights of the putative father who filed a legitimation petition to
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.049.html#t49a02s49-10" target="_blank">G.S. 49-10</a></cite> before the affidavit was filed. In re Adoption of Clark, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 61</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 791 (1990).

                            Low IQ No Excuse for Failing to Exercise Common Sense. - Mother could not use a purported IQ of 76 as a shield against the trial court's finding that the mother failed to exercise common sense by continuing to have unprotected sexual intercourse that
                            resulted in numerous unplanned pregnancies and placed the child's welfare in jeopardy, if for no other reason than straining the mother's already limited resources, including the time and money she could devote to caring for
                            the child. In re K.S, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 315, 646 S.E.2d 541 (2007).

                        <p>
                            The trial court did not err by issuing a written order terminating respondent's parental rights which contained language not included in its recital in open court where the findings about which respondent complained related to the "adjudication" by the
                            trial court, pursuant to the provisions of former G.S. 7A-289.32, that grounds for termination of respondent's parental rights existed at the time of the hearing, not to the court's "disposition" pursuant to G.S. 7A-289.31
                            and where the order entered by the trial court was in "general conformity" to the disposition announced in open court. In re Brim, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 535 S.E.2d 367 (2000).

                        <p>
                            Reliance on Prior Court Orders. - Trial court relied partly on evidence from prior proceedings and findings in earlier orders, which was proper; a trial court may not rely solely on prior court orders and reports but must receive some oral testimony and
                            make an independent determination regarding the evidence presented, and here the trial court took judicial notice of the record and the findings of fact appear to be based at least in part on testimony provided at the hearing,
                            which was sufficient to show that the trial court made an independent determination regarding the evidence presented. In re T.N.H., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 403</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 54 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Assignments of Error Abandoned. - Mother's cursory argument concerning neglect and abandonment was predicated upon not receiving proper notice of the motion to terminate and thus, her assignment of error concerning <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>                            were deemed abandoned under N.C. R. App. P. 28(b)(6). In re P.L.P., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 618 S.E.2d 241 (2005), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 361</cite>, 625 S.E.2d 779 (2006).

                            Failure to Enter Written Termination Order Within 30 Days. - Where the trial court did not reduce the parental termination to writing until seven months after the termination hearing in violation of the 30-day requirement of
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1109ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1109(e)</a></cite>, -1110(a), -1111(a); all parties were prejudiced, as the mother and child lost time together, the foster parents were in a state of
                            flux, and the adoptive parents were unable to complete their family plan. In re D.S., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 628 S.E.2d 31 (2006).

                            Failure to File Action Within 12-Month Recovery Period. - Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>,
                            as an agency filed the petition inside the statutory 12-month period for showing progress, as the period ran from the entry of the first custody order rather than from the mother's initial voluntary separation from the child.
                            In re A.C.F., <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 626 S.E.2d 729 (2006).

                        <p>
                            Duration Requirement Defined. - The "for more than 12 months" requirement in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite> means the duration of time beginning when the child
                            was "left" in foster care or placement outside the home pursuant to a court order, and ending when the motion or petition for termination of parental rights was filed. In re A.C.F., <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. App.</cite>                            520, 626 S.E.2d 729 (2006).

                            Removal Defined. - The legislature did not intend for any separation between a parent and a child to trigger the termination ground set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>,
                            failure to make reasonable progress; instead, the statute refers only to circumstances where a court has entered a court order requiring that a child be in foster care or other placement outside the home. In re A.C.F.,

                        <p>
                            Rights Not Properly Terminated. - Termination of the father's parental rights was reversed where the father voluntarily agreed to and completed the requirements of the case plan, and no finding had been made that the father's failure to pay child support
                            was willful or that father willfully left the children in foster care more than 12 months without making reasonable progress toward reunification. In re J.S.L., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                            151, 628 S.E.2d 387 (2006).

                            Termination Order Entered by Non-Presiding Judge. - Since the judge did not preside over the termination hearing, the first set of termination orders had never been properly entered and were a nullity; thus, the mother's appeal did not divest the district
                            court of authority to enter additional orders correcting the error, and since the trial court had the authority to enter the challenged orders and the mother had not advanced any other challenges to the validity of the orders,
                            the orders were affirmed. In re C.M.C., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 24</cite>, 832 S.E.2d 681 (2019).

                        <p>
                            No Error by Trial Court. - There was no possible error by the trial court and the order terminating the father's parental rights was affirmed; the order included sufficient findings, supported by clear evidence, that at least one statutory ground for
                            termination existed, plus the trial court made appropriate findings on each of the relevant dispositional factors and did not abuse its discretion in assessing the children's best interests. In re A.A.S.,

                            order was supported by competent evidence and based on proper legal grounds. In re L.E.M., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 396</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 341 (2019).

                            Standard of Proof for Termination and Removal Distinguished. - There is a substantive difference between the quantum of adequate proof of neglect and dependency for purposes of termination and for purposes of removal. The most significant difference is
                            that while parental rights may not be terminated for threatened future harm, the Department of Social Services may obtain temporary custody of a child when there is a risk of neglect in the future. In re Evans,

                            Neglected Juvenile - Under subdivision (a)(1), a neglected juvenile is defined as a juvenile who does not receive proper care, supervision, or discipline from the juvenile's parent, guardian, custodian, or caretaker, who has been abandoned, who is not
                            provided necessary medical care, who is not provided necessary remedial care, who lives in an environment injurious to the juvenile's welfare, who has been placed for care or adoption in violation of law,

                            are applicable to termination of parental rights proceedings where neglect is pursued. In re L.W., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 623 S.E.2d 626 (2006), review denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 534</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Father could not contend that certain issues did not lead to the juvenile's adjudication as neglected because he stipulated to the findings of fact and consented to the child's adjudication as a neglected juvenile; therefore, one finding of fact, which
                            was stipulated to by the father in the adjudication order, supported another finding of fact in the order terminating the father's parental rights in the child. In re O.W.D.A., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court's finding that the essential underlying issues of the neglect adjudication that concerned the father were his abuse of alcohol and illegal substances as well as housing and employment instability was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing
                            evidence because although the direct issues that led to the adjudication of neglect primarily related to the mother, the trial court was permitted to consider indirect issues which contributed to the child's neglect and removal.

                        <p>
                            Mother's parental rights were properly terminated because there was a pattern of neglect due to housing instability, substance abuse, leaving the juveniles with inappropriate caretakers, and domestic violence; the mother and the children had resided at
                            a homeless shelter, and after her incarceration for drug violations, she had failed to make proper arrangements for the children's care. In re N.B., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 23, 2021).

                        <p>
                            Father's parental rights were properly terminated because he did not provide support for the child, and although the father did send a letter in which he asked for the child's forgiveness, the letter in question had been his first contact with the child
                            after her entry into state custody; as a result, the record adequately supported the trial court's finding concerning the inconsistency of the father's contacts. In re N.B., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 23, 2021).

                            Court properly terminated a father's parental rights because the children were previously adjudicated to be neglected and dependent juveniles, it found circumstances leading to the prior adjudication, the requirements of the father';s case plan that he
                            agreed to and was ordered to complete to remedy those conditions, and the father's failure to comply with the requirements of his case plan; both parents had expressed their plans and desires on multiple occasions to get themselves
                            together, but each failed to follow through with services ordered by the court to help them reach their goals. In re J.E., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 23, 2021).

                        <p>
                            Court's findings supported the conclusion that grounds existed to terminate a father's parental rights because the father was able to work while incarcerated and did in fact work various jobs while incarcerated, yet, he contributed nothing to the cost
                            of the child's care during the relevant six-month period. In re J.M., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 23, 2021).

                            Parents' parental rights were properly terminated because the child was severely abused while she resided in the parents' care, an expert stated that the child was abused by an "adult who was concealing the truth," and the trial court made the reasonable
                            inference that the parents worked together to develop an explanation for the child's injuries in an attempt to conceal the truth. In re A.W., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 23, 2021).

                            with their abusers; accordingly, if returned to her care, the children would remain at risk of physical and sexual abuse, have unmet physical needs, and never heal from the trauma they had already endured. In re M.J.B., - N.C.

                            may adjudicate the nonexistence of this ground by finding the absence of either element, or by finding the petitioner's failure to prove either element by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. In re K.R.C.,

                            Where a parent has failed or is unable to adequately provide for his child's physical and economic needs, whether it be by reason of mental infirmity or by reason of willful conduct on the part of the parent, and it appears that the parent will not or
                            is not able to correct those inadequate conditions within a reasonable time, the court may appropriately conclude that the child is neglected. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>,

                            Failure to Provide Clean Home and Child Care. - Failure of parents, during the three months additional time allowed to them to make improvements, to provide a clean and suitable home for their children and to provide for appropriate child care when they
                            were absent was strong supporting evidence for the conclusion that the children were genuinely neglected within the terms of G.S. 7A-517(21) [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(15)</a></cite>].

                            Neglect may be manifested in ways less tangible than failure to provide physical necessities. - Therefore, on the question of neglect, the trial judge may consider, in addition, a parent's complete failure to provide the personal contact, love, and affection
                            that inheres in the parental relationship. In re APA, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 296 S.E.2d 811 (1982).

                            Trial court properly terminated the father's parental rights on the ground that the father neglected the father's children, because the father expressed some interest in visitation rights, but only if a paternity test showed that the father was one child's

                            The fact that a parent provides love, affection and concern, although it may be relevant, should not be determinative in controversies involving child neglect and custody, in that the court could still find the child to be neglected within the meaning
                            of the neglect and termination statutes. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).

                            In determining whether a child is neglected, the determinative factors are the circumstances and conditions surrounding the child, not the fault or culpability of the parent; therefore, the fact that the parent loves or is concerned about his child will
                            not necessarily prevent the court from making a determination that the child is neglected. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984).

                            Former G.S. 7A-289.32 (now this section) and former G.S. 7A-517(21) speak in terms of past neglect and make no provision for termination for threatened future harm. It is clear, however, that the legislature was mindful of the plight of children threatened
                            by a risk of future neglect, as shown by the terms of G.S. 7A-544 [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba03s7B-302" target="_self">G.S. 7B-302</a></cite>]. Under that statute, the Department may
                            obtain temporary custody of a child where there is a risk of neglect by the parent or guardian. This supports the position that the legislature was aware of the problem of future harm, and simply did not choose to make risk
                            of neglect a ground for termination of parental rights. In re Phifer, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 312 S.E.2d 684 (1984).

                            Alcohol abuse, without proof of adverse impact upon the child, is not a sufficient basis for an adjudication of termination of parental rights for neglect. In re Phifer, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 312 S.E.2d

                            A prior adjudication of neglect may be admitted and considered by the trial court in ruling upon a later petition to terminate parental rights on the ground of neglect. However, the sufficiency of such a prior adjudication of neglect, standing alone,
                            to support a termination of parental rights will be unlikely when the parents have been deprived of custody for any significant period before the termination proceeding. In re Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 708</cite>,

                            As May Neglect Occurring Prior to Previous Order Taking Custody from Parents. - In ruling upon a petition for termination of parental rights for neglect, the trial court may consider neglect of the child by its parents which occurred before the entry
                            of a previous order taking custody from them. This is so even though the parents have not had custody of the child from the time of the prior custody order until the time of the termination proceeding. In re Ballard,
                            <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 708</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 227 (1984).

                            But Court Must Also Consider Changed Conditions. - Evidence of neglect by a parent prior to losing custody of a child, including an adjudication of such neglect, is admissible in subsequent proceedings to terminate parental rights. The trial court must
                            also consider any evidence of changed conditions, in light of the evidence of prior neglect and the probability of a repetition of neglect. The determinative factors must be the best interests of the child and the fitness of
                            the parent to care for the child at the time of the termination proceeding. In re Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 708</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 227 (1984).

                            Where termination of parental rights is sought upon allegations of neglect, the court may consider evidence of neglect occurring before custody has been taken from the parents, but termination may not be based solely on conditions of neglect which may
                            have previously existed but no longer exist. The court must also consider evidence of any change in condition up to the time of the hearing, but this evidence is to be considered in light of the evidence of prior neglect and
                            the probability of repetition of neglect. In re White, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 344 S.E.2d 36, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 283</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 470 (1986);

                            To Determine Probability of Further Neglect. - In a case involving the termination of parental rights on the ground of neglect, the court may consider a prior adjudication of neglect. It must also review the parents' mental condition and evidence of changed
                            conditions up to the time of the hearing, in light of the evidence of prior neglect, to determine the probability of repetition of neglect. It is not essential, however, that there be evidence of culpable neglect following
                            the initial adjudication. In re Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 330 S.E.2d 513 (1985).

                            And Must Independently Determine If Neglect Exists at Time of Hearing. - The key to a valid termination of parental rights on neglect grounds where a prior adjudication of neglect is considered is that the court must make an independent determination
                            of whether neglect authorizing the termination of parental rights existed at the time of the hearing. In re McDonald, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 324 S.E.2d 847 (1984), cert. denied,

                            Trial court erred in terminating mother's parental rights based on neglect because the Department of Social Services presented no evidence that the mother could not, at the time of the hearing, adequately parent her children. Two of the witnesses presented
                            by the Department had not been involved with the family in the two to three years prior to the termination hearing, and a third, the social worker last assigned to the case, presented no evidence that the mother was unfit as
                            a parent at the time of the hearing. In re C.C., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 618 S.E.2d 813 (2005).

                            Since the time the petition to terminate the father's rights was filed, the father was released from incarceration, had obtained full-time employment, had family medical insurance available through the father's employer, and
                            had a furnished apartment which was near the father's work and schools for the children. In re G.B.R., <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 309, 725 S.E.2d 387 (2012).

                            The trial court erred in treating a prior adjudication of neglect as determinative on the issue of neglect at the time of a termination proceeding some three years later. While the court was entitled to consider the prior adjudication in the fact-finding
                            process, new findings were required based on changed conditions in light of the history of neglect by the parents and the probability of a repetition of neglect. In re Garner, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite>                            137, 330 S.E.2d 33 (1985).

                            cogent, and convincing evidence of neglect since that time, did not support termination pursuant to former G.S. 7A-289.32(2) (see now this section). In re Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite>                            411, 333 S.E.2d 554 (1985).

                            Where a child had not been in the custody of his father for a significant period of time prior to a termination of parental rights hearing, the trial court had to employ a different kind of analysis to determine whether the evidence supported a finding
                            of neglect because requiring the department of social services to show that the child was currently neglected by the father would make termination of parental rights impossible. In re Shermer,

                            Failure to Appoint Guardian Ad Litem - Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights without appointing a guardian ad litem to represent the mother, because an agency claimed that the mother was unable to care for her child because of mental
                            illness, and where the allegations contained in the petition or motion to terminate parental rights tended to show that the respondent was incapable of properly caring for his or her child because of mental illness, the trial

                            Imprisonment as factor for termination of parental rights. - Termination of parental rights does not require that the parent's incapability be permanent or that its duration be precisely known; instead, this ground for termination merely requires that
                            there is a reasonable probability that such incapability will continue for the foreseeable future. In re N.T.U., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 722, 760 S.E.2d 49 (2014).

                            Sufficiency of Trial Court's Findings of Fact. - Appellate court found that remand for further action was necessary because termination based upon neglect could not be based solely on past conditions that no longer existed. If the complaining parent contended
                            that the other parent's parental rights were to be terminated based upon neglect, a new termination hearing was required. In re O.J.R., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 769 S.E.2d

                            In a case terminating the father's parental rights based on neglect, clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supported the challenged findings of fact that he failed to understand or appreciate the extent and effects of the mother's established pattern
                            of child abuse; that he played a role in creating and fostering an injurious and abusive environment for his child; and that he was unable or unwilling to protect the child from abuse and harm, particularly if doing so would
                            require excluding the mother from the child's life. In re M.P.M., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 776 S.E.2d 687 (2015).

                            Trial court's findings were inadequate to support its conclusion of willful abandonment at to the mother, as the findings failed to address her efforts or ability to request and exercise visitation, to attend the child's sports games, or to communicate
                            with the child, particularly in light of the incomplete findings relating to her history of substance abuse and incarcerations, as well as the father's desire that the mother not have a relationship with the child while in
                            and out of custody. In re D.M.O., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 794 S.E.2d 858 (2016).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in terminating parental rights on the ground of neglect because the termination order contained no finding of a probability of a repetition of the neglect, which led to the child's removal from the parents' care; the record contained
                            evidence that could support, although not compel, a finding of neglect, but without further fact-finding, the court of appeals could not determine whether the trial court's conclusions were supported by its findings. In re
                            L.L.O., <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 799 S.E.2d 59 (2017).

                        <p>
                            Termination of the mother's parental rights on the basis of neglect was not supported by findings regarding the mother's situation or findings that the mother's situation and condition at the time of the hearing showed a likelihood of repetition of neglect.
                            In re Z.D., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 812 S.E.2d 668 (2018).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Findings were insufficient to support a determination that the father willfully abandoned the child; although the trial court found that the father did not have contact with the child nor provided any support, there were no findings as to whether the
                            father's actions were willful. In re N.D.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 71</cite>, 833 S.E.2d 768 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Findings failed to adequately support the court's determination that the father's parental rights were subject to termination for neglect based on abandonment; there was an absence of findings concerning the father's ability to contact the petitioner
                            or the child, to exercise visitation, or to pay any support in order to determine that his abandonment was willful. In re N.D.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 71</cite>, 833 S.E.2d 768 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Findings were insufficient to support a determination that the father had neglected his child because the father's incarceration alone could not serve as clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of neglect, the order did not establish that the father failed
                            to comply with the domestic violence-related portions of his case plan or engaged in continued acts of domestic violence, trial court's finding that the father had submitted three diluted drug screens was insufficient to support
                            a determination as to the likelihood of future neglect, and the trial court's finding that the father had not provided financially for the child, along with its determination that the father received SSI benefits and was not
                            required to pay child support, did not support its finding of neglect. In re K.N., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 274</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 861 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly concluded that neglect was likely to reoccur if the children were returned to the mother's care where the findings of fact showed that she had been unable to recognize and break patterns of abuse that had put her children at risk
                            and that she failed to acknowledge her responsibility for the events leading to her children's removal from the home. In re D.W.P., - N.C. - , 838 S.E.2d 396 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a TPR action, the trial court's findings supporting termination of the father's rights based on neglect clearly showed that the trial court evaluated his history of alcohol abuse and behavior over the 22-month period during which the juveniles were
                            outside the house, which included a repeated pattern of returning to alcohol and evasion of numerous breathalyzer tests, admission to relapsing several times during outpatient treatment, and failing breathalyzer tests before
                            and after completing outpatient treatment. In re Z.A.M., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 88</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 792 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ground of neglect for termination of a father's parental rights existed because the father was convicted for sexually abusing children and denied responsibility for those convictions, had persistent and serious mental health issues that affected the father's
                            ability to parent the child, and lacked stable housing until shortly before the termination hearing. Furthermore, the district court found that there was a high probability that a repetition of neglect would have occurred in
                            the future if the child were to have been placed with the father. In re N.P., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 61</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 801 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly terminated a father's parental rights based on neglect as there was no requirement that he be responsible for the prior adjudication of neglect, he made minimal efforts to show interest in the child while incarcerated, and the record
                            evidence showed that the father was responsible for his failure to satisfy his case plan's requirements. Moreover, the evidence supported the trial court's findings that the child was likely to be neglected if returned to the
                            father's care, the father was responsible for the lack of visitation, and his convictions and sentence were drug-related. In re S.D., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 67</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 315 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of a father's parental rights was appropriate because the trial court made sufficient findings of fact to support its conclusion that grounds existed to terminate the father's parental rights on the basis that neglect of the child would occur
                            if the child was returned to the father's care given the father's substance abuse and alcohol use issues, domestic violence concerns, and continuing to live with the mother despite her substance abuse issues and the domestic
                            discord in the home. In re J.O.D., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 797</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 570 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In light of the lengthy history of domestic violence between the parents, the trial court did not err by determining that the father's limited attendance at and his failure to complete a program constituted a failure to fully engage in domestic violence
                            treatment and a lack of reasonable progress toward addressing the issue of domestic violence. In re M.A., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 865</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 916 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Grounds existed to terminate the father's parental rights based on neglect where although the father had made some progress toward completing his court-ordered case plan, his success was extremely limited and insufficient in light of the child's placement
                            in state custody for over two years. In re J.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 772</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 44 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of a father's parental rights based on neglect was affirmed as the findings that he failed to adequately address domestic violence had ample evidentiary support and were, standing alone, sufficient to support a determination that there was
                            a likelihood of future neglect in the event that the children were returned to his care. In re M.A., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 865</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 916 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To the extent certain determinations were more appropriately treated as conclusions of law, the court considers them as such, and there were sufficient findings of fact, supported by clear evidence, to support the trial court's conclusion that grounds
                            existed to terminate respondent's parental rights for neglect. In re M.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 882</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 564 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Assuming arguendo the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court's finding about one incident between the mother and father, the remaining unchallenged findings established the mother's continued engagement with the father when she was not supposed
                            to have any contact with him, and thus the erroneous finding was not necessary to support the legal determination that grounds existed for the termination of the mother's parental rights on neglect grounds. In re M.C.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 882</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 564 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Neglect was a proper ground to terminate the father's parental rights; although he might have had no role in the mother's substance abuse, the child's removal from the mother was largely due to the fact that the child could not be placed with the father.
                            He failed to comply with the trial court's order, he was not incarcerated until almost 12 months after he entered into his case plan and more than 12 months since he last visited the child, and he had not developed a relationship
                            with her and had not shown an ability to care for her. In re J.M.J.-J., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 553</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 94 (2020).

                        <p>
                            District court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights for neglect and willful failure to make reasonable progress because the mother completed a parenting class, completed her substance abuse assessment, participated in individual therapy sessions
                            to address her mental health, re-engaged in treatment, was employed, submitted to drug testing, established more reliable communications with the Department of Social Services, obtained stable housing and transportation, and
                            showed reasonable progress to reduce or remove the likelihood of future neglect. In re C.N., - N.C. App. - , 842 S.E.2d 627 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to the minor child and that it was in the child's best interests that the mother's parental rights be terminated because there was evidence in the record of past neglect and a probability of future
                            neglect, the mother's failure to complete her case plan supported the conclusion that she willfully left her child in foster care or a placement outside the home for over 12 months without making reasonable progress in correcting
                            the circumstances that led to the removal of the child, and her failure to comply with substance abuse and mental health treatment and to address domestic violence issues sufficiently demonstrated her lack of reasonable progress.

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to her child for neglect, willful failure to correct the conditions that led to the child's removal from her home, failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of the child's care while the
                            child was in the Department of Social Services' custody, and as in the child's best interest because the trial court made sufficient dispositional findings regarding the child's bond with her maternal grandmother and half-brother
                            in light of the evidence before it, considered the relevant statutory criteria, and weighed the competing goals of preserving the child's ties to her biological family and achieving permanence for the child through adoption.
                            In re S.J.B., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Sept. 25, 2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A mother, by consistently providing gifts and repeatedly contacting the mother's child and the child's caregivers over a long period of time, showed the mother's intent to remain a part of the child's life. Therefore, the trial court's findings of fact
                            affirmatively demonstrated that the mother did not neglect the child by abandonment, and consequently, reversal of the portion of the trial court's termination order relying on the ground of neglect by abandonment was appropriate.
                            In re K.C.T., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Findings supported the conclusion that grounds existed under subsection (a)(1) to terminate a father's parental rights because the trial court found there was a likelihood of future neglect based upon the father's history; the trial court was within its
                            authority to determine the father's minimal efforts during his incarceration did not outweigh the evidence of his failures to make improvements while not incarcerated and to conclude there was a probability of repetition of
                            neglect. In re O.W.D.A., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of the mother's rights on the grounds of neglect was supported by substantial evidence; the trial court determined that mother's last-minute progress was insufficient to outweigh her long-standing history of alcohol and substance abuse and
                            domestic violence, as well as the impact these behaviors had on the children, and it was not error for the trial court to find that there likely would be a repetition of neglect in the future should they be returned to mother's
                            care. In re H.A.J., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                        <p>
                            In addition to the fact that the father was incarcerated for 28 years, the termination of his parental rights based on neglect was supported by his history of incarceration for drug offenses, his lack of care and attention to the children when he was
                            not incarcerated, a history of domestic violence between the father and the mother that was witnessed by the children, his use of illicit substances while the children were in his care, and lack of progress in his case plan,
                            all of which were incorporated under the trial court's finding of a likelihood of future neglect. In re J.S., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                            The following clear, cogent and convincing evidence supported a termination of respondent's parental rights based on a finding that her neglectful conduct continued and existed at the time of the termination hearing: An expert testified that respondent
                            continued to harass her son's caretakers, failed to demonstrate financial responsibility, could not focus properly on her son's needs, missed scheduled visitations, and did not keep DSS informed of changes in her circumstances.

                            The court affirmed the termination of a mother's parental rights for neglect where the trial court found that a prior adjudication of neglect was based on findings that the child "was starving to death" while in the mother's custody and suffered from
                            "failure to thrive," and that during supervised visitations with the child, the mother continued "to try and feed the [minor] child inappropriately both in the manner she tried to feed her and the food she brought to feed the
                            [minor] child." In re Pope, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 547 S.E.2d 153 (2001).

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating a mother's parental rights based on neglect where: (1) the mother failed to maintain stable housing and was unemployed, (2) the mother failed to comply with a child support order, (3) the mother
                            had left the child with others, including an incident initiating the child's removal from her custody, (4) the mother failed to provide proper medication for the child, (5) the mother had attempted suicide, had not cooperated
                            with social workers, did not follow through with mental health counseling, and did not complete parenting classes, and (6) the mother only sporadically visited and contacted the child for over five years. In re E.T.S.,

                        <p>
                            Termination order was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence based on the mother's unfitness to have custody, and the overwhelming evidence of neglect, including improper supervision of her children, inappropriate discipline, and the severely
                            unsanitary condition of the family's home due to the many different farm animals living therein, as well as a roach infestation. Further, given evidence of the significant positive progress that the children made since they
                            were taken from the mother's custody, termination was in the children's best interests. In re J.A.P., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 659 S.E.2d 14 (2008).

                            a substance abuse program and attended only 10 of 29 scheduled visits with the child and such neglect was likely to continue since the mother was engaged in substance abuse, lacked employment, and failed to obtain stable housing.

                            Termination of a father's parental rights based on the probability of repetition of neglect was supported by substantial evidence that showed that the father made no effort to visit his son in the five months prior to termination hearing, that the father
                            met with a parenting class instructor only once even though parenting classes were part of case plan, and that the father held only occasional part-time jobs. In re J.E.M., <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite>                            361, 727 S.E.2d 398 (2012).

                            was supported by evidence that the parents' relationship involved aggression and violence, that neither had learned to control their aggressive tendencies, that their conduct was harmful to the children, and that termination
                            of parental rights was in the children's best interests. In the Matter of T.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 556, 738 S.E.2d 759 (2013), review denied, 743 S.E.2d 194, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 538 (2013), review denied,

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err by terminating a mother's parental rights to three children on grounds of neglect because there was evidence of prior neglect, the neglect was ongoing, a substantial probability existed the children would be neglected or abused
                            in the future, and the mother continued to associate with individuals who abused her or the children. In re D.A.H.-C., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 742 S.E.2d 836 (2013).

                            Termination of the father's parental rights based on neglect was proper as the findings of fact supported the trial court's conclusion of law that the father neglected the child at the time of the termination hearing and that there was a likelihood of
                            repetition of neglect given the severity of the mother and the father's abuse of the child's siblings; the father's dishonesty with respect to his role in the abuse and his continued contact with the mother; and the father's
                            continued lack of understanding of the danger that the mother posed to the child. In re M.P.M., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 776 S.E.2d 687 (2015).

                            Termination of the mother's parental rights based on neglect was proper; issues of inappropriate discipline and domestic violence remained, the mother had not secured her own housing, and the findings supported the conclusion that there was a high probability
                            of the repetition of neglect if the children were returned to the mother's care. In re C.M.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 803 S.E.2d 853 (2017).

                            Trial court did not err in concluding that grounds existed under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1)</a></cite> to terminate a father's parental rights where, in addition to prior
                            adjudication of neglect, the father had a long history of criminal activity and substance abuse, he was aware of the mother's substance abuse issues, and he failed to follow through consistently with recommendations and directives
                            following his release, including decreasing visitation with the child. In re M.A.W., <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 149</cite>, 804 S.E.2d 513 (2017).

                            Mother's parental rights were properly terminated on the basis of neglect given the trial court's findings that she had not gained independent housing since the child was removed, she could not support herself, and she maintained contact with the child's
                            abusive father. In re A.L.Z., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 808 S.E.2d 176 (2017), review denied, stay lifted, stay denied, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 260 (2018) review denied, stay lifted,

                        <p>
                            There was competent evidence to support the findings that the child was a neglected juvenile and there was a likelihood of repeated neglect; the mother and father were incapable of parenting, they failed to demonstrate their ability to engage in safe
                            visitation multiple times, and they did not comply with their case plans. In re A.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 812 S.E.2d 875 (2018).

                            Father's appeal of the termination of his parental rights was dismissed because his counsel filed a no-merit brief, the father's pro se arguments were untimely and nothing more than unsupported allegations of error, and the court found that grounds for
                            termination existed and that termination of the father's parental rights was in the children's best interests. In re I.P., <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 638, 820 S.E.2d 586 (2018).

                            District court's findings supported the conclusion that the father's parental rights were subject to termination as the child would likely be neglected again if the child were returned to the father's care because the mother struggled with basic parenting
                            skills and relied on the father as a main support for parenting; the father was willing to leave the child alone in the care of the mother even though the mother was unfit for such accountability; the parents continued to be
                            in constant marital discord even while having supervised visits with the child; and the parents intended to remain together despite the aforementioned problems. In re Z.V.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 207</cite>,

                            supported a finding of neglect or the probability of its repetition at the time of termination hearing. In re Leftwich, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 67, 518 S.E.2d 799 (1999).

                            Where the evidence disclosed that respondent father had never provided a home or other essentials for his two children throughout their entire lifetime, and that he has basically depended upon others to do so, the fact that after the children were placed
                            in foster care respondent made some payments to Department of Social Services for their support did not invalidate the court's findings of neglect under former G.S. 7A-289.32(2) (see now this section). In re White,

                            of contact with child and lack of support of the child, that she had neglected the child by way of abandonment; the mother had wilfully refused to perform her obligations as a parent, had withheld her presence, love, care,
                            and opportunity to display filial affection from the child, and failed to financially contribute to the support of the child for a significant period of time. In re Humphrey, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 533,

                            Trial court did not err in terminating the father's parental rights to the minor child, as the father, who at times was incarcerated and who did not live with the mother and the child when not incarcerated, neglected the child by failing to financially
                            support the child, communicate with the child, and visit with the child but a few times and it was in the child's best interest to terminate the father's parental rights so that the mother could put the child up for adoption
                            as she desired. In re Yocum, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 580 S.E.2d 399 (2003).

                            Evidence that a father, although incarcerated since his child's birth, had not provided any financial support for the child from the compensation he received for his prison employment and had not sought any personal contact with the child or attempted
                            to convey love or affection for the child, nor had he inquired about the child in his infrequent correspondence with the child's mother, sufficiently supported the trial court's findings that the father neglected the child
                            under G.S.7B-1111(a)(1), and these findings supported a termination of the father's parental rights. In re Bradshaw, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 677, 587 S.E.2d 83 (2003).

                            Having found that the trial court's findings sufficiently supported its conclusion that a father neglected his child, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1)</a></cite>, allowing
                            termination of the father's parental rights, it was unnecessary for the appellate court to consider whether those findings were also sufficient for termination of the father's parental rights under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a7" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7)</a></cite>,

                            Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence existed to support termination of a mother's parental rights for neglect where: (1) her daughter was sexually abused in the mother's home under conditions the mother helped to create; (2) the mother was aware of
                            the sexual abuse, but failed to protect her child; (3) the mother did not continue therapy for the child after repeated sexual abuse, and (4) termination was in the best interest of the child because there was a strong likelihood
                            that the neglect would continue where the mother denied and/or minimized her responsibility for the abuse and neglect, and where she failed to minimize the conditions in her life that led to the child's abuse and neglect. In

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating a mother's parental rights to her daughter pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>; the mother failed to comply
                            with drug treatment and other requirements, and showed little interest in maintaining a relationship with the daughter, as evidenced by the mother's failure to pay to support the child and her failure to consistently visit
                            the child, and therefore the trial court properly determined that the child was neglected. In re Howell, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 650, 589 S.E.2d 157 (2003).

                            Order terminating mother's parental rights to her four minor children was proper where the children were previously adjudicated neglected, there was a probability of repetition of neglect if returned to the mother, four to five trial placements with the
                            mother had failed, the mother had a history of failing to show a positive response to counseling and educational programs, the mother left a stable job and housing to move to another state where she did not have employment
                            or independent housing, and she had been unable to cope with the pressure of caring for the children at the same time, with such findings being sufficient to establish neglect under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1)</a></cite>.

                            Trial court properly terminated the mother's parental rights where the unchallenged findings of fact showed that, inter alia, the mother's home had no heat, the mother had not seen the child for a significant period of time, and the mother had begun allowing
                            a sex offender to live with the mother, thereby supporting the finding of neglect. In re S.D.J., <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 665 S.E.2d 818 (2008).

                            Order terminating the parental rights to the minor child was affirmed because respondents were the sole care providers for the child when the injury occurred and the father failed to acknowledge why his child entered Mecklenburg County Department of Social

                            overwhelming in support of the initial finding that the child was neglected and would continue to be neglected if the mother regained custody; mother had failed to maintain a stable residence, was often in arrears on rent,
                            and since August 31, 2006, there had been seven summary ejectment actions filed against the mother. In re K.J.L., <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 698 S.E.2d 150 (2010).

                            despite the progress the father made in a rehabilitation program during his incarceration. The father had exhibited a pattern of recovery and relapse regarding his addiction to crack-cocaine and marijuana, and the trial court
                            properly considered that his success at rehabilitation while incarcerated was not indicative of how he would deal with his addiction once released. In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 715 S.E.2d 563

                        <p>
                            Because the evidence supported the trial court's findings that a child's father indicated an unwillingness to enter into a family services agreement, had never met with the child, and had no bond with the child, there was evidence to support the trial
                            court's conclusion that the child was neglected by the father. Thus, there was evidence to terminate the father's parental rights on this statutory ground. In re C.L.S., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite>                            75, 781 S.E.2d 680 (2016).

                            Termination of the father's parental rights was proper on the ground of neglect because he failed to appreciably address his substance abuse issues; he had only shown an extended abstinence from cocaine use while incarcerated; he did not complete substance
                            abuse treatment; he incurred serious felony charges during the pendency of the case and was convicted of discharging a firearm into occupied property; during his incarceration, he made no attempt to contact the child and had
                            limited contact with the Department of Social Services; and he could not use his incarceration as a shield against a conclusion that there was a probability of future neglect. In re A.S.T., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                            Termination of a father's parental rights on ground of neglect and abandonment was appropriate because the father did not comply with the father's case plan in that the father had positive drug screens, failed to engage in recommended substance abuse
                            treatment, and was inconsistent with visitation of the father's children. Furthermore, when the father did attend visitation the father appeared to be under the influence of substances. In re X.P.W., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov.

                            Incarceration of Respondent. - Trial court's findings of fact did not find clear, cogent, and convincing evidence and were insufficient to support its conclusion of law that the father's parental rights could be terminated on the ground that he was incarcerated
                            because it failed to make any adjudicatory findings concerning the father's alleged failings; the trial court found no other grounds existed upon which to base termination of the father's parental rights. In re J.D.A.D.,

                            there was no prior adjudication of neglect. There was a prior adjudication of delinquency, but the mother had already lost custody; thus, there was no evidence before the trial court that the mother had neglected the child
                            while the child was in the mother's care. In re J.G.B., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 628 S.E.2d 450 (2006).

                            that the policy of the Department of Social Services did not permit visitation with an incarcerated parent. In re C.W., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 641 S.E.2d 725 (2007).

                            approved, and the father chose not to place the child with one of those relatives because he believed that it was better for the child for him to remain in foster care.

                            criminal probation and while the child was in foster care did not meet the burden of showing that the father's substance abuse would have prevented him from providing for the proper care and supervision of the child. In re

                            Trial court erred in concluding that a mother's parental rights were to be terminated on the basis of neglect because the mother divorced the abusive father, completed all of the therapy and counseling courses required by the case plan, and devoted hours
                            to writing up a detailed safety plan for the child. In addition, each of the care providers stated that the mother had satisfactorily addressed all concerns about the mother's ability to safely and effectively parent the mother's
                            children and required no further counseling. In re K.L.T., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 826</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 28 (2020).

                            Because petitioners failed to prove that the father previously neglected the child and that he was likely to neglect the child again in the future, the evidence did not support termination of the father's parental rights on the basis of neglect. In re

                            indicative of a probability of continued neglect or whether the previous neglect had ameliorated, the trial court found insufficient facts to support its conclusion that respondent's minor children were neglected children and
                            its order terminating respondent's parental rights on that basis. Union County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Mullis, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 340, 346 S.E.2d 289 (1986).

                            a month in child support ($500 in arrears and $250 to keep current), insufficient evidence existed to support a finding of neglect within the meaning of subsection (2). Bost v. Van Nortwick,

                            Termination of respondent's parental rights was not supported by the evidence where none of the witnesses - the respondent's guardian ad litem, her counselor, and a court appointed clinical psychologist - expressed certainty that her mental illness would
                            prevent her from adequately parenting her children and where the father of one of the children, whom the trial court seemed to have viewed as a threat, had since died.

                            The trial court's findings were insufficient to terminate the mother's rights since it did not address whether the mother could pay support, address the concerns leading to the child's removal, or list the unmet conditions. In re Locklear,

                            had changed from the time it previously found the children were neglected; the father who had been in prison when those previous orders were entered was now out of prison, was no longer involved with the children's mother,

                            In a termination of parental rights proceeding, evidence that a father had failed to complete certain parts of his case plan was not clear, cogent, or convincing evidence that he neglected his children; because less than two months had elapsed since that
                            plan was adopted, there had not been an adequate time to assess his progress on that case plan. In re Shermer, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 576 S.E.2d 403 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Because the trial court's findings did not support the conclusion that the mother failed to make reasonable progress in correcting the conditions that led to a finding of neglect and the child's removal, the mother's rights were improperly terminated.

                            with the fact that the mother did not attend the hearing or respond in any way, refuted the presumption of valid service under G.S. 1A-1-4(j)(2). In re K.N., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 736, 640 S.E.2d 813 (2007).

                            Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights on grounds of neglect and dependency because a county department of social services (DSS) presented no oral testimony to carry its burden of proof as to neglect or dependency, and the mother's
                            testimony, which refuted DSS's allegations, was not sufficient to carry its burden of proving the allegations of the termination petition by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence; the trial court failed to make an independent
                            determination of whether neglect authorizing the termination of parental rights existed at the time of the hearing because no oral testimony was provided on behalf of DSS, and the testimony the mother presented did not provide
                            sufficient evidence to support the termination of parental rights determination. In re N.B., <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 670 S.E.2d 923 (2009).

                            Termination of a father's parental rights based in part on his failure to pay support was supported by findings that the father made no child support payments after the child placed in the custody of a county department of social services, that the father
                            had been gainfully employed from time to time, and that the had been physically and financially able to make some payment but had not done so. In re J.E.M., <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite>                            361, 727 S.E.2d 398 (2012).

                            Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper as she was working at a restaurant at the beginning of the six-month period but quit on her own accord, and any fault for the lapse in her medication was hers, as she chose to not seek another provider
                            until her symptoms worsened to the point that she needed to be hospitalized; the trial court's findings established that the mother had the ability to pay some amount toward the cost of care for her children but paid nothing.

                            A parent is required to pay that portion of the cost of foster care that is fair, just, and equitable based upon the parent's ability or means to pay. What is within a parent's "ability" to pay or what is within the "means" of a parent to pay is a difficult
                            standard which requires great flexibility in its application. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246 (1984); In re Garner, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite>                            137, 330 S.E.2d 33 (1985).

                            ability to pay such costs, but their ability to pay is the controlling characteristic of what is a reasonable amount for them to pay. In re T.D.P., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 595 S.E.2d 735 (2004), aff'd,

                            Where parent had opportunity to provide for some of the cost of care of child, and forfeited that opportunity by his or her own misconduct, such parent will not be heard to assert that he or she has no ability or means to contribute to the child's care
                            and is therefore excused from contributing any amount. In re Bradley, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 291 S.E.2d 800 (1982).

                            of her children's foster care, despite being physically and financially able to do so; the only evidence presented to the trial court on this subject established that she had been employed at various times since 1999 and did
                            not address whether she was employed during the six months preceding the filing of the termination petition or whether she had the financial ability to contribute to the children's support during that time. In re Faircloth,

                            per week into a hog operation at a time when he knew of his $30.00 per week obligation by virtue of court order, there was ample evidence from which trial court could have concluded that father failed to pay a reasonable portion

                            Findings of fact that minor children had been in the custody of county department of social services since July 1974, that parent had failed to pay any portion of the cost of care for the minor children since June 1979, and that while incarcerated in
                            the North Carolina Prison System, parent had the opportunity to participate in the work-release program but was removed from the program due to his violation of prison regulations by returning from the work-release program
                            in an intoxicated condition were sufficient to support the court's conclusion that parent failed to pay a reasonable portion of the costs of care of his minor children.

                            six months prior to the filing of the petition, because the mother, who generated income from a house-cleaning business and received tax refunds, was able to pay some amount greater than the amount the mother did in fact pay,
                            which was nothing. In re N.X.A., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 803 S.E.2d 244 (2017), review denied, 807 S.E.2d 148, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 957 (N.C. 2017).

                            Findings fully supported the trial court's conclusion that grounds existed to terminate a mother's parental rights based upon her willful failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care during the children's placement in county department of social
                            services custody because the mother was on notice of her failure to pay something towards the cost of care for her children; the trial court repeatedly found in its permanency planning orders that none of the parents were paying
                            child support. In re S.E., - N.C. - , 838 S.E.2d 328 (2020).

                            Willful Failure to Pay Not Shown. - Evidence did not clearly and convincingly show that a father willfully failed to pay a reasonable cost of care of two minor children in foster care where the father was incarcerated when the minor children were adjudicated
                            neglected, the father wrote to the department of social services about providing support but was informed that support could not be arranged at the time because the father was earning less than minimum wage, and the agency
                            could not establish a child support case. In re J.K.C., <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 721 S.E.2d 264 (2012).

                            "Abandonment" Defined. - Abandonment imports any willful or intentional conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child. Abandonment has also been defined
                            as willful neglect and refusal to perform the natural and legal obligations of parental care and support. It has been held that if a parent withholds his presence, his love, his care, the opportunity to display filial affection,
                            and willfully neglects to lend support and maintenance, such parent relinquishes all parental claims and abandons the child. In re APA, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 296 S.E.2d 811
                            (1982).

                        <p>
                            Abandonment implies conduct on the part of the parent which manifests a willful determination to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child. In re Searle, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite>                            273, 346 S.E.2d 511 (1986).

                        <p>
                            The word "willful" encompasses more than an intention to do a thing; there must also be purpose and deliberation. In re Searle, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 346 S.E.2d 511 (1986).

                            Question of Fact. - Whether a biological parent has a willful intent to abandon his child is a question of fact to be determined from the evidence. In re Searle, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 346 S.E.2d 511
                            (1986).

                        <p>
                            Time Period. - Because petitioner filed the petition on May 12, 2014, the six-month period from November 12, 2013, to May 12, 2014 was examined for abandonment purposes. In re S.Z.H., <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite>                            254, 785 S.E.2d 341 (2016).

                            Adoption Without Consent of Parent upon Finding of Willful Abandonment. - Prior to October 1, 1985, two procedures were available to enable a petitioning party to adopt a minor child without the consent of the opposing biological parent. First, under
                            this section, a court could terminate the parental rights of a biological parent upon a finding of one of the grounds enumerated therein, and then pursuant to G.S. 48-5, once a district court had entered an order terminating
                            the parental rights of the biological parent, that parent was no longer a necessary party to an adoption proceeding. Second, the court, under G.S. 48-5(d), upon proper motion, was authorized to hold a hearing to determine whether
                            an abandonment as defined in former G.S. 48-2(1)a and (1)b had taken place. However, effective October 1, 1985, these proceedings were merged into one termination of parental rights proceeding under subdivision (8) of former
                            G.S. 7A-289.32 (see now this section) to ascertain whether the parent had willfully abandoned the child for at least six consecutive months immediately preceding the filing of the petition. In re Searle,
                            <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 346 S.E.2d 511 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Contact Outside Six-Month Period. - While the father sent one card to the child after being served with the termination petition in June 2018, the card was sent outside of the relevant six-month period, and thus not determinative in adjudicating willful
                            abandonment. In re C.B.C., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 16</cite>, 832 S.E.2d 692 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Father's actions in 2018 did not demonstrate a commitment to parenting the child or an equivalent focus on the needs and well-being of her; their activities together did not progress beyond playing video or board games, and regardless, any error in these
                            findings was harmless and had no impact on the trial court's adjudication because they occurred in 2018 after the petition was filed and well outside the determinative time period. In re K.N.K.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 50</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 735 (2020).

                            Sufficiency of Trial Court's Findings of Fact. - Appellate court found that remand for further action was necessary because if a trial court meant to terminate a parent's parental rights due to willful abandonment, the court needed to provide both sufficient
                            findings of fact and conclusions of law indicating that the court was proceeding under the relevant statutory provision, and that the other parent proved that the parent had willfully abandoned the child for at least six consecutive
                            months immediately preceding the filing of the petition. In re O.J.R., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 769 S.E.2d 631 (2015).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in terminating parental rights because the termination order did not contain the necessary findings of fact to support the conclusion that the parents willfully left the child in foster care without making reasonable progress to correct
                            the conditions which led to the removal of their child; the parents sought transportation assistance from the county department of social services but were denied help, and they both testified they had been regularly applying
                            for work. In re L.L.O., <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 799 S.E.2d 59 (2017).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Supreme court was unable to undertake meaningful appellate review of the trial court's decision to deny a mother's petition to terminate a father's parental rights based upon a series of evidentiary findings that were untethered to any ultimate facts
                            or to any particularized conclusions of law that would explain the trial court's reasoning; the trial court's findings offered no assessment regarding the willfulness of the father's conduct toward the child on the matter of
                            abandonment. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 56 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a termination of parental rights action, evidence showed that the mother was in possession of her cousin's phone number and had other shared relatives in through whom the mother could have attempted to communicate with the child, who was in the cousin's
                            care, including the mother's own mother as well as the cousin's mother and grandmother. The mother's complete failure to show any interest in the child for more than the six months required supported the trial court's conclusion
                            that the mother acted willfully in abandoning the child. In re L.M.M., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Sept. 25, 2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although a trial court's findings failed to show that a mother - who had mental health issues, lacked a driver's license, and was unemployed and relied on supplemental security income - had a purposeful, deliberative and manifest willful determination
                            to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the mother's child, in light of the minimal contact between the mother and the child during the relevant six-month period, remand was appropriate for the court
                            to address the issue of whether willful abandonment existed. In re K.C.T., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly terminated father's parental rights for willful abandonment; findings established that father made no attempt to contact the children from late December 2013 through June 2019, he did not purchase clothing or other items for the children,
                            and he did not provide any financial assistance for the children's benefit. Trial court did acknowledge that father had been injured in an unsolved shooting but ultimately determined that his failure to contact the children
                            was willful. In re G.G.M., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                        <p>
                            Abandonment Not Shown. - There was no support for the trial court's finding that father willfully "withheld his presence, love, care and affection from the children" during six consecutive months immediately preceding petition to terminate parental rights,
                            where during this time he visited the children during the Christmas holiday, attended three of the children's soccer games and told the mother that he wanted to pay his back child support and set up regular visitations. Bost

                        <p>
                            In a termination of parental rights proceeding, the trial court's findings were not sufficient to support its conclusion that a father willfully abandoned his child for six months, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(7)</a></cite>,
                            because during the six months before the termination petition was filed the father was incarcerated. In re Shermer, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 576 S.E.2d 403 (2003).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of the natural father's parental rights based on willful abandonment was reversed where the evidence showed that the father was instructed not to contact child during pendency of criminal charges against him for first degree sexual assault
                            involving a minor child - charges which were later dismissed, and that the father made child support payments when he had the money to do so. In re T.C.B., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite>                            482, 602 S.E.2d 17 (2004).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Abandonment was not a proper basis for termination of the father's parental rights where the Department of Social Services failed to allege abandonment as a ground for termination in its petition, and thus the father had no notice that abandonment was
                            going to be an issue during the termination hearing. In re C.W., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 641 S.E.2d 725 (2007).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a7" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7)</a></cite> on the ground that she willfully abandoned her child for
                            the six-month period prior to the filing of the termination petition because the mother's actions during the six-month period did not demonstrate a purposeful, deliberative, and manifest willful determination to forego all
                            parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child; the mother visited the child eleven times during the relevant time period and brought appropriate toys and clothes for the child to those visits, and many of
                            the findings of fact the trial court made for the relevant period were not of great relevance for a determination of willful abandonment pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a7" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7)</a></cite>.
                            In re S.R.G., <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 671 S.E.2d 47 (2009).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Judicial determination that a parent willfully abandoned her child, particularly when a court is considering a relatively short six month period, needs to show more than a failure of the parent to live up to her obligations as a parent in an appropriate
                            fashion because the General Assembly did not intend the same factors relevant to termination pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>,
                            which requires a twelve month period before filing a termination petition on that ground, to be used as substantive evidence in finding willful abandonment under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a7" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7)</a></cite>;
                            the findings must clearly show that the parent's actions are wholly inconsistent with a desire to maintain custody of the child, and a parent's failure to address the necessary requirements laid out in his or her case plan
                            to regain custody of her child becomes more relevant to any finding of willful abandonment the longer the parent fails to act. In re S.R.G., <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 671 S.E.2d 47 (2009).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There was not sufficient competent evidence to terminate the mother's parental rights based upon abandonment, as the mother paid child support, maintained regular contact with the children's GAL, apparent sobriety, steady employment, and at least minimal
                            participation in the proceedings. In re A.G.M., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 773 S.E.2d 123 (2015).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            District court's finding of willful abandonment was not supported by the evidence where the father had entered into a case plan and substantially complied with it, he was current in his child support obligation, regularly visited the child, attended parenting
                            classes, and participated in the child's medical appointments. In re D.T.N.A., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 801 S.E.2d 642 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Terminating a father's parental rights on grounds of abandonment and neglect by abandonment erred because (1) the father did not willfully abandon the children during the six months before the petition was filed, as the father sought the children's custody
                            during that time, and (2) findings based on a consent order granting the children's custody to others, terminating the father's child support obligation, denying the father visitation, and purporting to waive any objection
                            to termination, erred, as the order was void as against public policy, since the statutory termination process had to be followed, any agreement to relinquish parental rights avoided this process, and the order's terms did
                            not meet statutory requirements for a consent to adoption or relinquishment of parental rights to an agency. In re C.K.C., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 158, 822 S.E.2d 741 (2018).
                        </p>

                            Explanation that the father had long planned to relocate to California with the child, based on his belief that he would be able to take the child with him or place her with his sister, did not inherently suggest a willful intent to abandon. In re E.B.,

                            "Willful" Abandonment Not Shown. - Trial court erred by relying on the parties' stipulation that a father had abandoned the children for six months as the sole ground for the termination of his parental rights under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a7" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7)</a></cite>,
                            as he never stipulated that his abandonment was willful, and the mother presented no evidence on that issue. In re A.K.D., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 745 S.E.2d 7 (2013).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Clear evidence did not support the finding that the father failed to maintain communications with the child during the relevant time; in addition, even during the last half of the six-month period, the evidence tended to show that the father attempted
                            to communicate with the child but the mother stopped allowing him to contact her. In re S.Z.H., <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 785 S.E.2d 341 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Certain findings addressed factual grounds that could support a conclusion of abandonment and some of them addressed events outside the relevant six-month period, other findings, including that there had been no cards or gifts from the father to the child,
                            and that the father failed to provide support, did do not demonstrate that he had a willful determination to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child; the trial court erred in concluding that
                            the father had willfully abandoned the child. In re S.Z.H., <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 785 S.E.2d 341 (2016).

                            Trial court erred in terminating a father's parental rights based on abandonment because, while the trial court found that the father sent the mother a letter prior to her filing the petition, the finding neglected to indicate whether it occurred prior
                            to or during the relevant six-month period, the father testified that he wrote the child multiple letters while in prison, but that the mother refused to provide him with contact information for herself or the child, the trial
                            court's findings did not address, in light of his incarceration, what other efforts the father could have been expected to make to contact the mother and the child, and the trial court's order improperly mixed its factual findings
                            with its conclusions of law. In re D.E.M., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 618, 810 S.E.2d 375 (2018).

                            Trial court erred in terminating the father's parental rights based on abandonment because there was no finding of willfulness as a domestic violence protective order specifically prohibited the father from harassing or interfering with the mother and
                            required him to stay away from her home and workplace; and the child was only three years old and, any communication with, gifts to, or requests to visit her would have had to necessarily been directed to the mother. In re

                            Termination of the father's parental rights based on abandonment was erroneous because the trial court's findings established that the father took a number of affirmative actions, including sending e-mails to the maternal aunt, attending a Child Family
                            Team meeting, and satisfying the requirements of his case plan during the relevant six-month period in an attempt to show his love, concern, and affection for his daughter. In re Z.J.W., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 12, 2021).

                            Abandonment Shown. - Termination of father's parental rights was upheld where Department of Social Services presented clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supporting several grounds for termination, including willful abandonment; the department testified
                            that the father had at most only seen the child immediately after birth, and the child was three at time of the termination proceedings. In re R.R., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 628,

                            Father's rights in his two minor daughters were properly terminated due to abandonment under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a7" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7)</a></cite> because he had not visited or telephoned
                            the children in more than six months, despite having the ability to do so, and he had not provided the children with any cards, letters, or gifts for several years. In re M.D., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 35,

                            Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in the record supported the findings that the minor child was dependent as defined by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101</a></cite>, the mother failed
                            to show the ability to properly parent the minor child and attend to his special needs, and the mother had not seen the minor child since January 2007 and had not given gifts or support or shown any love or affection for the
                            child since she last saw him. The findings in turn supported the trial court's conclusions that the minor child was dependent and abandoned, both of which are statutory grounds for termination.

                            Evidence was sufficient to support termination of a father's parental rights based on abandonment pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a7" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7)</a></cite>, as he failed to attend

                            While the better practice would have been to specifically plead termination pursuant the section for abandonment, the petition sufficiently alleged facts to place the father on notice that his parental rights may be terminated on the basis that he abandoned
                            his child, as it alleged that the father's lack of involvement with or regard for the minor child constituted neglect In re T.J.F., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 750 S.E.2d 568

                            Trial court did not err in concluding a parent had abandoned a juvenile because, during the relevant six-month period, the parent did not visit the juvenile, failed to pay child support in a timely and consistent manner, and failed to make a good faith
                            effort to maintain or reestablish a relationship with the juvenile. The parent's last-minute child support payments and requests for visitation did not undermine the trial court's conclusion that the parent had abandoned the
                            juvenile. In re C.J.H., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 772 S.E.2d 82 (2015).

                            Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper based on willful abandonment of her child as the mother made no effort to contact the child and paid nothing toward his support during the six months immediately preceding the filing of the grandparents'
                            petition to terminate because, while her parental rights had been previously terminated, there was no evidence that the mother sought to stay the order while her appeal was pending, or otherwise requested visitation with the
                            child from the trial court or the grandparents; she was not prohibited from contacting and visiting the child; and she demonstrated almost no interest in the child since losing custody of him. In re D.E.M.,

                            District court properly terminated a mother's parental rights after adjudicating the existence of abandonment because the law of the case doctrine did not apply where the district court made several unchallenged findings of fact about events occurring
                            after the filing of the first petition by withholding her presence, her love, her care and failing to take any opportunity to display maternal affection, and there was no finding of fact in the order on appeal regarding respondent's
                            reasons for her continued failure to visit or contact the child in the six months prior to the filing of the new petition in 2016. In re K.C., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 812

                        <p>
                            Sufficient evidence supported the trial court's determination that the father willfully abandoned his children, as he had no contact with them during the statutory time period, he made no effort to have any involvement with them for several years following
                            the temporary custody judgment, and the fact that he was incarcerated for most the six-month period was not material, as he was aware during his incarceration of his ability to seek relief from the trial court's orders and
                            he did not do so. In re E.H.P., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 388</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 49 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err by determining that grounds existed to terminate the father's parental rights because the record showed that the father moved out of state without informing DSS, he failed to attend permanency planning hearings, he did not request
                            a single visit with the child, and he did not make any video conference calls to the child until after the termination petition was filed. In re E.B., - N.C. App. - , 834 S.E.2d 169 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sufficient evidence supported the trial court's termination of the father's parental rights due to abandonment; the father had no contact with the child or her grandparents, who had custody of the child, for nearly one year prior to the filing of the
                            termination petition, and he had the ability to make at least some contact but chose not to. As the father had not challenged these findings, they were binding on appeal. Further, he failed to resume visitation, did not send
                            any letters to the child, and did not provide any financial support. In re C.B.C., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 16</cite>, 832 S.E.2d 692 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Abandonment grounds existed to terminate the father's parental rights and the trial court properly determined that he willfully chose not to see the child; though the father was out of jail and aware he could exercise visitation rights, he did not visit
                            the child, and after being given a second chance, the father took no action because he had "so much going on at one time." Additionally, he neither sent the child any gifts or cards nor inquired about his welfare. In re B.C.B.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 32</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 748 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court's findings supported its adjudication of termination of the father's parental rights for abandonment; from 2014 until the petition's filing date, the father had no contact or communication of any kind with the child, provided her no financial
                            support, and never attended any of her medical appointments, educational functions, or extracurricular activities. These facts supported the ultimate findings that the father acted willfully and with an intention to forego
                            his parental responsibilities to the child. In re K.N.K., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 50</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 735 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Termination of a father's parental rights on the ground of willful abandonment was appropriate because the trial court found that the father, who was incarcerated and subject to an order prohibiting the father from directly contacting the children, one
                            of whom the father had allegedly sexually abused, had, with one exception, not contacted the mother to ask permission to have contact with the children or to otherwise express any love, affection, or parental concern for them
                            during the statutorily prescribed six-month period. In re: A.G.D., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 317</cite>, 841 S.E.2d 238 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly adjudicated grounds for terminating the father's parental rights based on willful abandonment because the evidence showed that he had the ability to contact the child's mother directly about the child but made no effort to do so,
                            and he provided no financial support for the child despite having full-time employment throughout the relevant six-month period. In re J.T.C., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 18, 2020).

                            six-month period or in the two years before that period, and her failure to attempt any form of contact or communication gave rise to an inference that she acted willfully in abdicating her parental role, notwithstanding any
                            personal animus between her and the caregivers. In re A.L.S., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 515</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 89 (2020).

                            Termination of a father's parental rights to the father's children on the ground of willful abandonment was appropriate because the father willfully withheld the father's love, care, and affection from the children during the determinative six-month period.
                            Furthermore, the father's one unsuccessful request to visit the children during the six-months immediately preceding the filing of the termination petition did not undermine the trial court's ultimate finding and conclusion
                            that the father willfully abandoned the children. In re J.D.C.H., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Sept. 25, 2020).

                            Termination of a father's parental rights on ground of neglect and abandonment was appropriate because the father did not comply with the father's case plan in that the father had positive drug screens, failed to engage in recommended substance abuse
                            treatment, and was inconsistent with visitation of the father's children. Furthermore, when the father did attend visitation the father appeared to be under the influence of substances. In re X.P.W., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov.

                            Trial court properly terminated a father's parental rights based on abandonment because the biological mother informed him of her pregnancy approximately four months prior to the child's birth, the father had no contact with the child, did not provide
                            any care or support for the child during the 15 months from the time the child was born until he was incarcerated, and while incarcerated, he waited nearly two months to sign the Department of Social Services case plan, and
                            could only verify that he completed one case plan item: a parenting class. In re A.J.P., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                            at providing financial support by listing the child's name as his dependent on a work release application such that child support payments could be deducted from his pay but listed the wrong last name for his child and the
                            name of the county as the child's address and failed to make any inquiry when no deductions were made by the Department of Corrections. In re McLemore, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite>                            426, 533 S.E.2d 508 (2000).

                            because the grandparents did not lack the ability to obtain standing to adopt the child as they were the child's grandparents and legal custodians; they had raised the child since he was 18 months old; they wished to adopt
                            him; by all accounts, the child was thriving in the grandparents' home; and the child's guardian ad litem recommended the termination of the mother's and the father's parental rights in order to facilitate the child's adoption

                            to show that mother was mentally incapable of caring for her children was the testimony of doctor who testified that the fact that someone carries a diagnosis of personality disorder does not mean that that person is incapable
                            of raising children and that mother's pattern of behavior by itself did not mean that she was incapable of taking care of her children. In re Scott, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 760,

                            Termination of the mother's parental rights was in the child's best interests as the record provided overwhelming evidence that the mother's intentional actions created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to the child; evidence showed that the
                            mother had Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP) and that during the two years prior to the child being removed, the mother subjected the child to 25 different emergency room visits, 60 office visits to pediatricians, 143 prescriptions,
                            and 8 admissions to the hospital and the mother made no substantial improvements to correct the conditions as the mother continuously failed to comply with a court order preventing the mother from providing child care services
                            to other minor children while unsupervised and caring for animals and she continued to display the attention-seeking behaviors associated with the disorder. In re Greene, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite>                            410, 568 S.E.2d 634 (2002).

                            conduct a hearing to determine whether a guardian ad litem should be appointed; at the hearing, the trial court must determine whether the parents are incompetent within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.035A.html#t35As0Ia01s35A-1101" target="_blank">G.S. 35A-1101</a></cite>,

                            of the facts that led to her child's removal, and the trial court failed to conduct an inquiry into whether it was necessary to appoint her a guardian ad litem. In re T.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite>                            239, 765 S.E.2d 88 (2014).

                            Termination in Best Interests of Children. - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding termination of a mother's parental rights was in the best interests of the children because documentary evidence produced by the children's guardian ad litem
                            noted that with therapy, the children would be able to be adopted; the trial court's order did contain a finding addressing the children's behavioral issues, and the trial court found that with continued therapeutic treatment,
                            the likelihood of their adoption remained high. In re A.L.L., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 802 S.E.2d 598 (2017).

                        <p>
                            Because the trial court's findings were based on clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of dependency, it properly terminated the mother's parental rights; the mother's longstanding mental health conditions and her repeated failures to follow recommendations
                            for treatment necessary to care for her children safely constituted clear, cogent, and convincing evidence to support the trial court's findings of dependency. In re A.L.L., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite>                            252, 802 S.E.2d 598 (2017).

                            Termination of the mother's parental rights was in the son's best interest as he had a strong bond with his current foster family and was forming a long-term attachment to them; he was receiving structure and stability from the foster family; he needed
                            permanence and continued therapy; and the mother was no longer participating in his therapy and had not called to inquire about his welfare. In re A.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>,

                            Trial court properly terminated a father's parental rights in his son because the son's potential placement with a relative was not a factor it was required to consider or make findings about during the dispositional phase of the termination of parental
                            rights proceeding; the trial court determined that the child's best interests would be served by remaining in the custody of the county department of health and human services rather than being placed with a relative. In re
                            S.D.C., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 285</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 854 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Contrary to the mother's assertion, leaving her sons in their current foster placements with periodic visitation by her was not working as a plan; this arrangement was not only contrary to the permanent plan established by the trial court, it also served
                            to deny the children the prospect of a safe, permanent home within a reasonable amount of time as contemplated by the Juvenile Code. Termination of the mother's parental rights was affirmed. In re J.S.,

                            Mother was entitled to a guardian ad litem where the petition to terminate her parental rights alleged that depression and personality and emotional problems rendered her unable to parent her child; because the trial failed to appoint a guardian ad litem
                            for the mother, the termination order was reversed and the case was remanded. In re S.B., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 494, 602 S.E.2d 694 (2004).

                            Mental Retardation. - The appellate court would not incorporate a diligent efforts mandate in a statute devoid of such language; if due diligence is to be a requirement of the mental retardation ground for termination, that is a matter for the legislature,
                            the courts having no right to expand statutory terms. In re Guynn, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 437 S.E.2d 532 (1993).

                            Alcohol Abuse - Evidence of record supported the trial court's findings of fact, which in turn supported its legal conclusion that the father's protected status as parent was not constitutionally displaced; except for two driving while impaired convictions,
                            there was no evidence that the father drank to the point of intoxication, regularly or ever, the father had driven only once on a public road after his license had been revoked as he drove to the grandmother's house after learning
                            that the children's mother had died, and the trial court could not discern any problem with the father's employment or economic situation as the father had been with the same employer for eight years and had a good record as
                            an employee. Owenby v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 142</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 264 (2003).

                            Where a jailed father asked not to be taken to court to appear at a parental rights termination hearing, it showed that the child was not a priority and that the child was a neglected and abandoned; termination of the father's parental rights was therefore
                            in the child's best interest. Whittington v. Hendren (In re Hendren), <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 576 S.E.2d 372 (2003).

                            Lack of Willigness to Establish Safe Home. - Record supported the trial court's finding that respondent lacked the willingness or ability to establish a safe home and thus the trial court did not err by concluding that grounds existed to terminate respondent's
                            parental rights; she had a history of unstable housing, she had not satisfactorily completed her case plan, and the child was sexually abused while in respondent's care during a time when she was living in a motel room, and
                            she did not believe he was sexually abused. In re T.N.H., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 403</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 54 (2019).

                            child; the father's parental rights to another child had been involuntarily terminated, and his mental health concerns did not allow him to provide a safe home. In re N.G., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 891</cite>,

                            Findings of Fact Inadequate. - Trial court's findings that father had willfully left children in foster care for more than 12 months and that father had failed to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of caring for children were inadequate because, in
                            large part, they were merely a recitation of allegations that a department of social services made in its petition seeking termination of parental rights and did not provide specific findings of the facts established by the
                            evidence, admissions, and stipulations. In re Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 564 S.E.2d 599 (2002).

                            of fact by the trial court on that issue were required. In re N.B., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 773, 688 S.E.2d 713 (2009).

                            Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights because it failed to make sufficient findings of fact, and did not ultimately find, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)(1)</a></cite>,
                            that attempted reunification efforts would be futile, or reunification would be inconsistent with the juvenile's health, safety, and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable time; since the trial court made findings
                            of fact addressing the reunification efforts already made by the county department of social services and the mother's demonstrated failure to complete her case plan, but it did not link any of those findings to the two prongs
                            set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba05s7B-507ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-507(b)(1)</a></cite>. In re I.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 714 S.E.2d 495 (2011).

                        <p>
                            Appellate court found that remand for a new termination of parental rights hearing was necessary because there was no evidence presented at trial that would have supported termination of a parent's parental rights based upon dependency. In re O.J.R.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 769 S.E.2d 631 (2015).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights because its order was internally inconsistent and thus, unreviewable; there were contradictory findings as to the mother's mental health care and her domestic violence issues, and the factor
                            of financial assistance to potential adoptive parents seemed to outweigh the close emotional bonds between the mother and children and her efforts to regain custody. In re A.B., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                            157, 768 S.E.2d 573 (2015).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in terminating the mother's parental rights based on failure to make reasonable progress, because it did not address her progress or lack thereof leading up to the termination hearing and its findings were insufficiently specific to
                            support the ultimate finding that defendant failed to make reasonable progress toward correcting the conditions that led to removal of the child. In re Z.D., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite>                            441, 812 S.E.2d 668 (2018).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of the mother's parental rights based on dependency was not supported by evidence that the mother was incapable of caring for her son and that such incapability would continue for the foreseeable future. In re Z.D.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 812 S.E.2d 668 (2018).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the trial court failed to make the required statutory finding regarding an appropriate alternative child care arrangement, and no evidence was presented that would have allowed the court to make such a finding, reversal of the court's conclusion
                            that dependency provided a ground for termination of parental rights was appropriate. In re K.C.T., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                            Trial court's order determining that the father's parental rights in the daughter were subject to termination on the basis of neglect lacked sufficient support, although remand was required because the record contained evidence from which the trial court
                            could, if it elected to do so, find that a repetition of neglect would be probable in the event that the daughter was returned to the father's care. In re Z.J.W., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 12, 2021).

                        <p>
                            When Written Findings Not Required. - Since there was no conflicting evidence about either the likelihood of each child's adoption if the mother's rights were terminated or one child's strong bond with his prospective adoptive parents, no written findings
                            were required in this regard; as no prospective permanent placement had been identified for the other two children, that factor did not apply. The trial court did not violate the statutory mandate as to its determination of
                            the children's best interests. In re J.S., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 811</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 66 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Order Internally Inconsistent. - Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights because the contradictory nature of its findings of fact and conclusions of law prohibited the court of appeals from adequately determining if they supported
                            its conclusions of law that the mother failed to make reasonable progress toward correcting the conditions that led to the removal of the children from her care and custody and terminating her parental rights was in the children's
                            best interests. In re A.B., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 157, 768 S.E.2d 573 (2015).

                        <p>
                            Rights of imprisoned parent properly terminated. - Evidence supported the conclusion that the mother was incapable of providing for the care of the child, that this incapacity would continue, and that the mother failed to provide any viable alternative
                            child care arrangements; the mother had been continuously incarcerated since September 2011, nothing indicated that she would be released from incarceration in the foreseeable future, and thus the trial court did not err in
                            finding there was a reasonable probability that her incapability would continue for the foreseeable future, and her proposed caretakers were deemed unsuitable. In re N.T.U., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite>                            722, 760 S.E.2d 49 (2014).

                            Court properly terminated a father's parental rights because the father's choices and actions resulted in a lengthy delay in his projected release date from incarceration and significantly limited his access to classes, programs, services, and employment
                            which directly related to his case plan; there was no error in the trial court's findings of fact regarding the father's failures in accomplishing his case plan, most of which resulted from circumstances for which he was responsible.

                            Rights Properly Terminated. - The trial court properly terminated respondent mother's parental rights in her two children where the evidence supported findings by the court that the children were neglected children within the meaning of former G.S. 7A-278(4)
                            and that respondent failed to pay any portion of their foster care costs for more than six months preceding the filing of the petition as called for under subdivision (4) of former G.S. 7A-289.32 (see now this section). In
                            re Biggers, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 332, 274 S.E.2d 236 (1981).

                        <p>
                            The following findings supported the court's conclusions that mother's parental rights should be terminated for neglect: (1) The child was in the bottom 5% of children in her age group in weight; (2) the mother failed to supervise her properly; (3) the
                            child was allowed to remain in dirty diapers and to drink out of discarded bottles; (4) the child lived in an environment injurious to her health and welfare; and (5) the mother suffered mental problems resulting in inability
                            to care for herself and her child. In re Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 137, 330 S.E.2d 513 (1985).

                        <p>
                            A trial court had sufficient evidence upon which to base its order for termination of parental rights where the evidence included unrefuted testimony that the family home was in a constant state of disarray and uncleanliness, that the mother often seemed
                            incoherent, tending to stare off and to ignore those around her, and that the father stated that he was unwilling to let the children remain in the home because his violent temper made it unsafe for the children to be with
                            him and that he threatened to lock and bar the door and starve the children if they were not removed. In re Black, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 332 S.E.2d 85 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Where prior to removal of children from their home, the mother's boyfriend had abused the children, the children had been treated in the local hospital emergency room for five different incidents of ingestion of foreign materials, and the mother and children
                            had lived in four different locations over an 18-month period, and where mother missed 25 out of 59 scheduled visits while children were in foster care, attended only six out of 22 scheduled parenting classes, was terminated
                            from mental health counseling because of nonattendance, moved her residence seven times, failed to advise Department of Social Services of her whereabouts for a period of 14 months, and married the boyfriend who had been found
                            to have abused her children, the court properly terminated mother's parental rights. In re Parker, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 423, 368 S.E.2d 879 (1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Facts that father had little if any contact with his daughter in the year before he murdered his daughter's mother; that since the murder, father had been incarcerated; that father had twice given his consent for the child's adoption by his sister and
                            her husband; that father had known that the child was in petitioners' custody and had nevertheless made no effort to contact petitioners, to send support for daughter to petitioners, or to establish any verbal or written communication
                            with the child, supported the trial court's conclusion that father "acted in such a way as to evince a lack of parental concern for the child" and were sufficient to constitute neglect pursuant to former G.S. 7A-289.32(2) and
                            7A-517(21). Clark v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 373 S.E.2d 317 (1988).

                            Trial court properly considered all of the evidence in concluding as law that minor children were neglected juveniles and then properly terminated the parental rights of the parents pursuant to this section. Smith v. Alleghany County Dep't of Social Servs.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 727, 443 S.E.2d 101, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 696</cite>, 448 S.E.2d 533 (1994).

                        <p>
                            The findings overwhelmingly established a basis for surviving respondent mother's motion to dismiss termination action, where there was substantial evidence of neglect including domestic violence between respondent and her live-in boyfriend, inappropriately
                            leaving the child in the care of others, respondent's illegal drug use and distribution in the presence of the child, an overall history of lawlessness, respondent's repeated incarcerations and a prior adjudication of neglect.
                            In re Blackburn, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 607, 543 S.E.2d 906 (2001).

                        <p>
                            Termination of father's parental rights was proper where: (1) the father never had a custodial relationship with his 13 year old child, nor did he have any significant personal or financial relationship with the child other than an occasional letter and
                            a total of $125 in monies and gifts; (2) the relationship was unlikely to change in the future due to the father's lengthy incarceration and the child's unwillingness to see him; and (3) the father's only alternative for providing
                            for the care of the child was through the assistance of his parents, who had no relationship with the child, and even failed to attend the termination of parental rights hearing. In re Williams,
                            <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 951, 563 S.E.2d 202 (2002).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evidence that the mother of two minor children had performed practically none of the things required by the court at the time that the children had been placed in foster care a year before, to include the fact that the mother had not even attended the
                            termination hearing despite her attorney's efforts to contact her and to get her to attend, supported trial court's findings terminating the mother's parental rights. In re Frasher, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite>                            513, 555 S.E.2d 379 (2001).

                        <p>
                            Termination of parental rights was proper because clear, convincing, and cogent evidence showed the mother failed to make reasonable progress in correcting the condition, substance abuse, which led to the removal of her children. In re Mitchell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 559 S.E.2d 237 (2002).

                            Trial court properly terminated the mother's parental rights where the evidence showed that the mother failed to provide any parental guidance, personal contact, love, or custodial/ spiritual support for at least six months prior to the filing of the
                            grandmother's petition and that the mother's neglectful behavior was likely to continue for the foreseeable future because she had a long history of being incarcerated for various criminal offenses as well as a long history
                            of substance abuse and failure to address those problems with necessary treatment. Lechuga v. Ore (In re Ore), <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 586 S.E.2d 486 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating a father's parental rights because grounds for termination existed under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(5)</a></cite>                            where, in the three-and-a-half years since the mother told the father that she was pregnant and that he was the father, and until the mother contacted him about child support, the father had expressed no interest in discovering
                            whether the mother had given birth, in determining whether the child was his, or in taking responsibility for the child. In re T.L.B., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 605 S.E.2d 249 (2004).

                            terminated the parents' rights to other children, and the parents were unable or unwilling to establish a safe home for the child based on the parents' mental and physical illnesses.

                            There were sufficient findings to support the termination of parental rights order, including the fact that the father failed to propose an alternate replacement to take care of the children, that the father failed to provide any contact, love, or affection
                            for the children, and that the father failed to attempt to contact the children while he was incarcerated. In re D.J.D., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 615 S.E.2d 26 (2005).

                            care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress, after the children had been returned to her once, as clear, cogent and convincing evidence showed she did not (1) complete required parenting, budgeting, and
                            homemaking classes, (2) obtain mental health counseling, (3) have a phone, or (4) keep a clean home, and she offered no specific plan for the children's care while she worked, if they were returned, and the evidence showed

                            for more than 12 months without showing to the satisfaction of the court that reasonable progress under the circumstances has been made in correcting those conditions which led to the removal of the juvenile, and willfulness
                            may be found where a parent has made some attempt to regain custody of the child but has failed to exhibit reasonable progress or a positive response toward the diligent efforts of a department of social services; extremely

                            if she were placed in his care, and that he would be incarcerated until the child reached the age of majority provided clear, cogent, and convincing evidence to support the termination of his parental rights. In re P.L.P.,

                            Evidence including the transient state of the mother's housing, the mother's untreated hygiene issues, and the mother's failure to complete parenting classes was sufficient to support termination of the mother's parental rights under

                            by evidence that the father continued to reside with the mother who had an untreated substance abuse problem she would not admit to. In re S.N., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 636 S.E.2d 316 (2006).

                            Father's assignments of error concerning the delay in filing a termination petition and other alleged technical errors did not provide a basis for overturning the trial court's order terminating his parental rights where the father failed to allege any

                            the trial court's prior orders concerning the child, as well as the facts associated with those orders, thereby providing the factual allegations supporting the legal bases.

                            Termination of a father's parental rights was affirmed because the trial court's findings regarding the father were properly supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, and its findings supported its conclusions; the trial court found that the
                            father abused two of his children, neglected his children, and willfully left his children in foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress.

                            its determination that the mother committed voluntary manslaughter, as the evidence indicated that the child died from injuries arising from abuse, and the trial court properly admitted evidence pursuant to hearsay exceptions,
                            as a medical examiner's report was admissible under G.S. 8C-1-803(8) as a public record, and a police officer was properly allowed to testify as to statements by the mother's daughter that she saw her mother hit the deceased
                            child on the head pursuant to the excited utterance exception. In re J.S.B., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 192, 644 S.E.2d 580 (2007).

                            When the mother was adjudicated competent, it established only that the mother regained the capacity to manage the mother's own affairs, not that the mother, facing a termination of parental rights petition, had the capacity to provide proper care and
                            supervision for the child; in terminating the mother's parental rights the court was entitled to find, based on the mother's three-year history of relapses, that there was a reasonable probability that the mother's incapacity
                            resulting from substance abuse disorder would continue. In re A.H., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 644 S.E.2d 635 (2007).

                            failed to follow through with any of the other activities regarding parenting, therapy, anger management, or medication management. In re C.M.S., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 646 S.E.2d 592 (2007).

                            Trial court's findings that the father failed to make reasonable progress were based on clear, cogent, and convincing evidence stemming from the period of time between the child's initial removal and the entry of the consent order granting guardianship
                            to the guardians, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>; the findings included that the father only sporadically complied with
                            the case plans and failed to show any positive response to assistance efforts, willfully refused to stop using marijuana, and displayed inappropriate behavior and unwarranted hostility toward the department of social services,
                            the foster parent, and the guardians. In re H.L.A.D., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 381, 646 S.E.2d 425 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 170</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 712 (2008).

                            In terminating parental rights, the trial court only needed to find one basis for termination pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>, and the trial court based its termination
                            on detailed findings and conclusions as to ongoing, severe and repeated abuse of the child, who suffered injuries that were not accidental (including fractures), who had failed to thrive, and who was an abused juvenile as defined
                            by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101(a)</a></cite>; thus, respondent mother's argument that the termination was based solely on felonious child abuse charges lacked merit. In re R.B.B.,

                            to complete a domestic violence program and a mental health assessment, and to follow through with recommendations; (2) the mother entered the domestic violence program, but was terminated for lack of attendance; (3) the mother
                            reentered, and attended 25 sessions, but was terminated for dishonesty because she did not disclose to the program administrators that she was pregnant, and actively hid her pregnancy; (4) the mother failed to attend therapy
                            sessions on a regular basis as recommended; and (5) a finding that the mother continued her relationship with the father was supported. In re J.Z.M., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 158, 663 S.E.2d 435 (2008).

                            Trial court's findings were sufficient to support its conclusion that a parent's lack of progress justified termination of parental rights under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>.
                            The parent had not successfully completed substance abuse treatment or parenting classes, and the parent's extremely limited progress was not reasonable progress. In re S.N., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 21, 2008).

                            Although the father had made some progress, termination of father's parental rights was proper because, at the time of the termination hearing, the father was unemployed, had not maintained suitable housing, had not participated in court-ordered anger
                            management counseling, and continued to allow one of the children to be in the presence of the mother despite numerous court orders prohibiting any contact between the mother and the children. In re N.A.L.,

                            Trial court did not err in ruling that grounds existed to terminate a mother's parental rights to her child pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(8)</a></cite> because the trial
                            court's findings of fact supported its conclusion that the mother committed a felony assault that resulted in serious bodily injury to another child in her care; the mother did not assign error to that conclusion of law, which
                            precluded review of the conclusion on appeal under N.C. R. App. P. 10(a). In re I.T.P-L, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 670 S.E.2d 282 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 581</cite>, 681 S.E.2d

                            conclusion that the father willfully failed to pay reasonable portion of cost of care for child, and that fact that the evidence showed, inter alia, that the father failed to stay drug free, maintain suitable housing for child,

                            (1) the parent's therapist testified that the parent had consistently been in domestic violence situations which caused the therapist to call the parent's judgment into question about who the parent had living with the parent;
                            (2) the therapist expressed a concern that something really bad at some point could happen to the child; (3) the therapist opined that the parent had the ability to establish a safe home for the child; and (4) a foster care
                            social worker testified that the worker was not certain that the child would be safe if the parent was not on the parent's medication and that parent had a history of inviting people to stay in the parent's home that often

                            an acquaintance had been awarded custody of the child due to the mother's substance abuse problems and abandonment of the child; she could not unilaterally decide that she no longer wanted the acquaintance to have custody of

                            Trial court properly terminated the mother's parental rights due to neglect, as there had been a prior finding of neglect and there would be a probable repetition of neglect if the child were returned to the mother given her failure to comply with the

                            Termination of the father's parental rights was proper as the child was a dependent juvenile because the father conceded that due to his lengthy incarceration he could not provide care or supervision to the child; his proposed relative placement with
                            the father's mother was not possible as she stated she had failing health and was residing in a retirement community that did not allow children; and his proposed relative placement with the father's sister was not a viable
                            option as the child had been in level IV psychiatric treatment and had been moved to a level III group home, and no relative placement would currently be appropriate based on the level of care the child required. In re N.N.B.,

                            Unchallenged findings showed the mother repeatedly prioritized her relationship with the father over the safety of the children by continuing to allow the father around the children and by violating court orders and the mother's refusal to acknowledge
                            the effect of domestic violence on the children and her inability to sever her relationship with the father supported the trial court's determination that the neglect of the children would likely be repeated if they were returned
                            to the mother's care, making termination proper. State v. Palmer, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 18, 2020).

                            Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper based on a failure to correct the conditions that led to the removal of the juveniles as the mother had unaddressed substance abuse issues, the condition of the home was unsafe, and she failed to
                            attend medical and developmental appointments for the juveniles. In re A.H.F.S., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                            Termination of the father's parental rights was proper based on a failure to correct the conditions that led to the removal of the juveniles as the mother and father continued to reside together, and their primary residence was still unsafe. In re A.H.F.S.,

                            Father's contention that his conduct did not evince a settled purpose to forego all parental duties or to relinquish all parental claims was unavailing given the unchallenged findings of fact which showed that the father petitioned for legal custody and
                            visitation rights before the determinative period began but took no further action. The father also did not provide any emotional or material support even though he could have, and the father's actions as found by the trial
                            court, which led to the entry of the restraining order, supported a reasonable inference of willfulness. In re I.R.M.B., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                            Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper, as the child had been in foster care for more than 26 months, the mother did not adequately address her substance abuse, she had only been in her current housing for two months, which was inadequate,
                            and she had not established stable employment. Thus, the trial court properly determined that the mother's tenuous, limited progress on the issues that directly led to the child's prior adjudication was not enough to diminish
                            the probability that child would likely be neglected again. In re B.T.J., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                            Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper, as she conceded that she left her children in foster care for 16 months, exceeding the 12 months required to terminate parental rights, and, contrary to the mother's arguments, the trial court's
                            findings involving the ample time she had to make progress on her case plan, her failure to adequately address her substance abuse and mental health issues, and the willfulness of her actions were all supported by clear, cogent,
                            and convincing evidence. In re A.M.L., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                            Trial court properly determined that the mother's parental rights could be terminated because the mother did not make a reasonable effort to correct the issues attributable to her relationship with one child's father and the prevalence of domestic violence
                            that led to the children's removal from her care. Instead, she prioritized her relationship with that father while falsely and repeatedly claiming that the relationship had ended, evincing a willful failure to make reasonable
                            progress in addressing her issues with domestic violence. In re L.N.G., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

                            Order terminating the mother';s parental rights was supported by evidence that she failed to follow through with parenting classes, submitted to substance abuse assessments but had not complied with recommended services or requested drug screens, had
                            not provided documentation of her reported employment, failed to turn herself in for a probation violation, failed to follow through with mental health assessments and appointments, and fabricated the death of her mother as

                            to resolve criminal matters, and to be of lawful behavior, he was found guilty of multiple infractions during his incarceration including gang behavior, assault on staff, possessing a weapon, and coordinating an assault. In

                            Rights Not Properly Terminated. - In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, where the evidence showed that, except for one 10-minute interval when mother left child alone with its father, who abused the child, the mother had not abused or neglected
                            the child, such evidence did not support a termination order. In re Alleghany County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Reber, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 331 S.E.2d 256 (1985), aff'd,

                            The trial court erred in terminating a father's parental rights on the grounds of the father's incapability of caring for the child pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a6" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)</a></cite>                            (2001); the father was scheduled to be released from prison shortly, and there was no evidence at trial to suggest that respondent suffered from any physical or mental illness or disability that would prevent him from providing
                            proper care and supervision for the child, nor did the trial court make any findings of fact regarding such a condition. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 565 S.E.2d 245 (2002), cert. denied,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the child of respondent mother was removed from her because of the mother's drug use, but, during the 12 months prior to the filing of a petition to terminate her parental rights, the mother successfully completed a drug abuse treatment program,
                            tested negative for drugs on several occasions, attended a drug abuser's support group, maintained regular employment as a nurse, and showed herself to be a fit and proper person for visitation, such evidence showed that the
                            mother had made reasonable progress under the circumstances in correcting the conditions that led to the removal of the child; therefore, the trial court erred in terminating the mother's parental rights. In re Pierce,
                            <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 68</cite>, 565 S.E.2d 81 (2002).

                        <p>
                            No evidence or finding suggested that the mother's "social phobia" led or contributed to the parents' failure to provide the children with sufficient food, nutrition, or hygiene, and thus, the trial court's finding that the mother failed to make reasonable
                            progress to reunite with her children because she failed to seek services to address her "social phobia" was without statutory authority. In re D.L.W., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite>                            32, 773 S.E.2d 504 (2015).

                            In the absence of finding willful failure as supported by clear, cogent and convincing evidence, the trial court erred in concluding the mother's lack of stable employment and transportation showed a lack of reasonable progress towards correcting those
                            conditions which led to the removal of the children. In re D.L.W., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 773 S.E.2d 504 (2015).

                        <p>
                            Termination of the mother's parental rights due to an inability to provide proper care an supervision was improper, as the Department of Health and Human Services failed to show that substance abuse would prevent the mother from providing for the proper
                            care and supervision of the children. In re A.G.M., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 773 S.E.2d 123 (2015).

                        <p>
                            In a private termination action, the trial court erred in terminating the father's parental rights, and the termination order was reversed because the petition for termination did not allege that his parental rights were subject to termination based on
                            abandonment; there was no evidence that the father had any court-ordered obligation to pay child support; and the trial court failed to make required findings on the ground that the father failed to legitimate the child. In

                            Reasonable Progress Shown. - Mother made reasonable progress in correcting the conditions that led to the removal of her children during more than 12 months that the children were in the custody of the Department of Social Services; among other things
                            she attended family education sessions and parenting classes, acquired appropriate housing, and maintained her home. In re C.C., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 618 S.E.2d 813 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Failure to Show Progress. - Termination of the mother's parental rights based on the ground of failure to make reasonable progress was proper because she had not maintained stable employment for a minimum of six months; she failed to obtain stable housing
                            for at least six months as her frequent moves constituted evidence of housing instability, and she was days shy of having resided at her current residence for the designated six-month period of time; and she failed to complete
                            the recommended treatment needed to fully address the core issues of substance abuse and domestic violence which had played the largest roles in the children's removal. In re I.G.C., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 201</cite>,
                            835 S.E.2d 432 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper based on her willful failure to make reasonable progress because, inter alia, the mother voluntarily placed the children in the custody of the county department of social services so that the father
                            could live with her; and she failed to protect her children by allowing the father, who had assaulted her and two of the children, to return to the family home. In re A.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>,
                            835 S.E.2d 417 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evidence and findings of fact supported the trial court's conclusion that a mother failed to make reasonable progress toward correcting the conditions which led to the removal of the mother's child from the mother's care because, after participating in
                            a drug rehabilitation program, the mother decided to address the mother's long-standing addiction issue solely by entering a methadone program without any counseling plan to resolve the mother's resultant dependence on that
                            substance. In re A.B.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 752</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 902 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of a mother's parental rights was appropriate because the mother made little progress in satisfying the mother's case plan as the mother failed to complete parenting classes, had not scheduled a mental health assessment, had not completed
                            substance abuse classes, had refused to participate in domestic violence treatment, had failed to submit to drug screens, had not visited with the children in months, and had been charged with drug related criminal offenses.

                            In Determining Whether Adequate Services Were Provided Court Properly Considered Progress Up Until Time of Hearing. - Nothing in the record supported the mother's contention that the trial court erred in terminating the mother's parental rights because
                            the Department of Social Services failed to provide the mother with adequate services upon the mother's reaching the age of majority. The mother reached the age of majority more than a year before the termination hearing and
                            the trial court properly considered evidence of the mother's progress up until the time of the hearing. In re J.G.B., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 628 S.E.2d 450 (2006).

                            since was in the legal and physical custody of her mother. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 56 (2020).

                            Construction of "Conditions of Removal." - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-904" target="_self">G.S. 7B-904(d1)(3)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite> appear
                            to contemplate an ongoing examination of the circumstances that surrounded the juvenile's removal from the home and the steps that need to be taken in order to remediate both the direct and the indirect underlying causes of
                            the juvenile's removal from the parental home' the "conditions of removal" contemplated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite> include all of the factors that directly
                            or indirectly contributed to causing the juvenile's removal from the parental home. In re B.O.A., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 372</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 305 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Construction of "Conditions of Removal." - Nothing in the statutory language suggests that the only "conditions of removal" that are relevant to a determination of whether a particular parent's parental rights in a particular child are subject to termination
                            pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite> are limited to those which are explicitly set out in a petition seeking the entry of a nonsecure
                            custody order or a determination that a particular child is an abused, neglected, or dependent juvenile. In re B.O.A., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 372</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 305 (2019).

                            Period of Foster Care Need Not Be Continuous. - In view of the 1985 amendment to subdivision (3) of former G.S. 7A-289.32 (see now this section), which prior to the amendment required the parent to have left the child in foster care "for more than two
                            consecutive years," but was amended to shorten the period to an excess of 18 months (now 12 months) and to eliminate the word "consecutive," the period of foster care need not be 18 continuous months. Herell v. Taylor,
                            <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 387 S.E.2d 230 (1990).

                            Period of Foster Care Under "Court Order." - Mother's parental rights to three children were properly terminated under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite> because the
                            children had been in an out-of home-placement since March 2008 neglect proceedings, and the court's order converting the neglect case into a civil custody case, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-911" target="_self">G.S. 7B-911</a></cite>,
                            qualified as a "court order" under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111</a></cite>; the children were placed with the paternal grandparents after the neglect proceedings and, after a permanency
                            planning review in September 2008, the grandparents were awarded legal and physical custody. In re L.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 739 S.E.2d 596 (2013).

                            Two Part Analysis to Be Performed By the Court. - Trial court, to find grounds to terminate a parent's rights under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>, must perform
                            a two part analysis, as the trial court must determine by clear, cogent and convincing evidence: (1) that a child has been willfully left by the parent in foster care or placement outside the home for over 12 months; and (2)
                            as of the time of the hearing, also as demonstrated by clear, cogent and convincing evidence, that the parent has not made reasonable progress under the circumstances to correct the conditions which led to the removal of the
                            child. Evidence and findings which support a determination of reasonable progress may parallel or differ from that which supports the determination of willfulness in leaving the child in placement outside the home. In re O.C.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 457, 615 S.E.2d 391 (2005), cert. denied, - N.C. - , 623 S.E.2d 587 (2005).

                        <p>
                            The grounds which render a putative father's consent to adoption unnecessary under G.S. 48-6(a)(3) are identical to the grounds for terminating his parental rights under subdivision (6) of former G.S. 7A-289.32 (see now this section). While termination
                            of a putative father's rights may precede an adoption petition, prior termination of his rights under this Chapter is not necessary if, under the applicable provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite>,
                            his consent to the adoption is not necessary; his parental rights are then terminated by the final order of adoption under G.S. 48-23. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 381 S.E.2d 835 (1989), rev'd on
                            other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 61</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 791 (1990).

                        <p>
                            Under subdivision (3) of this section as it read prior to amendment in 1985, petitioner had to prove the absence of both substantial progress and positive response in order to justify terminating respondents' parental rights. In re Harris,
                            <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 360 S.E.2d 485 (1987).

                        <p>
                            "Willful Abandonment" Compared. - Although the breadth of "willful abandonment" should often encompass "willfully leaving" a child in foster care, the broad finding of willful abandonment is not essential to the more limited determination required under
                            subdivision (3) of this section. In re Harris, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 360 S.E.2d 485 (1987).

                        <p>
                            "Willful" Defined. - In the context of a termination based on willful abandonment, the word "willful" connotes purpose and deliberation; however, under this section willfulness is something less than willful abandonment. In re Nolen,
                            <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 453 S.E.2d 220 (1995).

                        <p>
                            Under former G.S. 7A-289.32 (see now this section), willfulness means something less than willful abandonment. In re Oghenekevebe, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 473 S.E.2d 393 (1996).

                            "Willfulness" when terminating parental rights on the grounds of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>, is something less than "willful" abandonment, is not precluded
                            even if the respondent has made some efforts to regain custody of the children, and may be found where the parent, recognizing her inability to care for the children, voluntarily leaves the children in foster care. In re Shepard,
                            <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 591 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

                        <p>
                            Notice Issues. - In view of the fact that nothing in the relevant statutory provisions limits the "conditions for removal" to those specified in any initial abuse, neglect, or dependency petition or any subsequent amendment to that petition and the fact
                            that the department adequately alleged that it was seeking to terminate respondent-mother's parental rights in the mother pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>,
                            the notice-related concerns expressed by the Court of Appeals did not justify overturning the trial court's termination order. In re B.O.A., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 372</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 305 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of a mother's parental rights was inappropriate because the mother's child entered the custody of family relatives when the mother agreed to a voluntary kinship placement. Although the relatives later obtained full custody of the child through
                            a civil custody order, that order did not provide sufficient notice to the mother that the mother's parental rights would be imperiled by the loss of custody or inform the parent what steps would be necessary to make reasonable
                            progress and avoid termination. In re K.C.T., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                        <p>
                            Incarceration of respondent, standing alone, neither precludes nor requires finding the respondent willfully left a child in foster care. In re Harris, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 360 S.E.2d 485 (1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a termination of parental rights proceeding, the trial court's findings were not sufficient to support its conclusion that a father willfully left his child in foster care for more than 12 months without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions
                            which led to the child's removal under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(2)</a></cite>, because there were no findings as to the father's progress or lack thereof
                            during the relevant 12-month period before the termination petition was filed, and the father had been incarcerated during those 12 months and had no involvement in the events which led to the child's removal. In re Shermer,
                            <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 576 S.E.2d 403 (2003).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evidence did not clearly and convincingly show that a father willfully left two minor children in foster care without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions where the father was incarcerated when the minor children were adjudicated neglected,
                            and, pursuant to the case plan, the father maintained contact with the department of social services, attended on-going substance abuse treatment, and completed the only parenting class offered by the Department of Correction,
                            but did not attend anger management because this type of class was not offered at the prisons in which he had been placed. In re J.K.C., <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 721 S.E.2d
                            264 (2012).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Compliance with Case Plan Relevant. - There is judicial recognition that parental compliance with a judicially adopted case plan is relevant in determining whether grounds for termination exist pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>                            even when there is no direct and immediate relationship between the conditions addressed in the case plan and the circumstances that led to the initial intervention, as long as the objectives sought to be achieved by the case
                            plan provision address issues that contributed to causing the circumstances that led to the juvenile's removal from the home. In re B.O.A., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 372</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 305 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As long as a particular case plan provision addresses an issue that, directly or indirectly, contributed to causing the juvenile's removal from the parental home, the extent to which a parent has reasonably complied with that case plan provision is, at
                            minimum, relevant to the determination of whether that parent's parental rights in his or her child are subject to termination for failure to make reasonable progress pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>.
                            In re B.O.A., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 372</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 305 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Nexus Between Case Plan And Conditions of Removal. - Necessary nexus between the components of the court-approved case plan with which the mother failed to comply and the conditions which led to the child's removal from the home existed in this case;
                            the trial court's unchallenged findings of fact, including those regarding the mother's failure to comply with her case plan, adequately supported the trial court's conclusion that she willfully left the child in the department's
                            custody for a period of 12 months without making reasonable progress toward correcting the conditions that led to the child's removal from the home. In re B.O.A., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 372</cite>,
                            831 S.E.2d 305 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Reasonable Progress Standard. - Reasonable progress standard enunciated in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite> did not require the mother to completely remediate the
                            conditions that led to the children's removal or to render herself capable of being reunified with her children. In re J.S., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 811</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 66 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Failure to Show Progress. - A court cannot terminate respondents' parental rights under subdivision (3) of former G.S. 7A-289.32 (see now this section) absent the necessary additional conclusion and supporting findings that respondents failed to show
                            substantial progress (now reasonable progress under the circumstances) in correcting the conditions leading to the removal of their children. In re Harris, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite>                            179, 360 S.E.2d 485 (1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was in the nine-year-old child's best interests that respondents' parental rights be terminated where voluminous evidence in the record documented the child's special needs, and his mother'
                            unwillingness to meet them, where the evidence supported a finding that the father abused the child, refused to seek counseling to address his emotional problems, and willfully left the child in foster care for more than 12
                            months without making reasonable progress toward reunification, and where neither parent had contributed financially to the child for many months. In re McMillon, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite>                            402, 546 S.E.2d 169 (2001).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The evidence and the trial court's findings regarding respondent's substance abuse did not support the conclusion that mother had failed to make "reasonable progress under the circumstances in correcting those conditions which led to the removal of the
                            child" to foster care, as required by former G.S. 7A-789.32(3), where there was no evidence that the mother had used drugs for over two years, and evidence showed that she had successfully completed drug treatment, including
                            random drug screens, attended Narcotics Anonymous, maintaining contact with her sponsor, and currently worked at a hospital, which required a drug screen before hiring her. In re Pierce, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite>                            641, 554 S.E.2d 25 (2001), affirmed, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 68</cite>, 565 S.E.2d 81 (2002).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a case in which after the Department of Social Services had filed a petition alleging that children were abused and neglected as a result of being placed with their grandfather, with whom their mother had placed them when the mother was sent to prison,
                            mother and the children's father stipulated to findings of neglect, leading to the children's transfer to the Department's custody, and where at the time the petition was filed, the mother was living with a boyfriend, and did
                            practically nothing to regain custody, not even attending the termination hearing, there was clear, cogent and convincing evidence to support the trial court's finding that the mother had left the children in foster care for
                            a year without making reasonable progress in correcting the conditions that led to the children's placement in the first place. In re Frasher, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 555

                            Trial court's findings were supported by evidence that the mother left her three children in foster care for over a year without showing reasonable progress; her fourth child's treatment and status were clearly relevant to show neglect. In re Johnston,

                            Trial court's finding that parents willfully left their son in foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress in correcting the conditions which resulted in the removal of their son was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing
                            evidence where: (1) the mother's attendance at a one-day workshop did not evidence any real effort; (2) the mother steadfastly refused to participate in counseling and would not agree to change her methods of disciplining her
                            son, which included whipping her son with a belt to the extent that marks and bruises resulted; and (3) the father completed an anger management class, but he had only a limited understanding of the concepts presented. In re

                            Termination of mother's parental rights by the trial court was affirmed, as the mother willfully left her juvenile child in foster care after the juvenile was adjudicated as neglected and dependent for more than 12 months, without showing the trial court
                            reasonable progress under her circumstances. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 75, 582 S.E.2d 657 (2003).

                            Despite some efforts to comply with a trial court's order and Department of Social Service requirements shortly before the termination of parental rights proceeding, a mother's parental rights were terminated regardless of her good intentions where there
                            was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding of her lack of progress during the year preceding the Department's petition to terminate her parental rights under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>                            for wilful abandonment; mother's failure to attend therapy sessions, her acts in repeatedly upsetting the child, leaving the child in foster care, failing to show sufficient parental skills, and failing to comply with a prohibition
                            of having unrelated males in the home supported the order terminating the mother's parental rights. In re B.S.D.S., <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 540, 594 S.E.2d 89 (2004).

                            removal where, inter alia, the Department never entered into a case plan against which the trial court could have measured the father's progress, the father attempted to remedy the issue of the children's failure to receive
                            letters the father sent, and there was no evidence to support a finding that the father was ordered not to have contact with the children pursuant to a probation violation order. In re C.W.,

                            There was sufficient evidence that a mother had willfully left a child in foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress under the circumstances in correcting those conditions that led to the removal of the child under

                            rather, the court only had to determine whether the mother had made reasonable progress under the circumstances in correcting those conditions which led to the children's removal. In re L.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite>                            249, 739 S.E.2d 596 (2013).

                            Trial court's unchallenged findings, which were deemed to be supported by sufficient evidence and were binding on appeal, supported its adjudication that the mother willfully left her children in foster care for more than twelve months without making
                            reasonable progress to correct the conditions leading to their placements. In re H.D., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 768 S.E.2d 860 (2015).

                            Parental rights were terminated because a trial court found that a parent willfully left the parent's children in foster care for twelve months without showing that reasonable progress was made in alleviating the conditions that brought the children into
                            the custody of a county department of social services. The parent engaged in a pattern of self-defeating cycles of dishonesty, engaged in a pattern of violence with paramours, family members, and caretakers to the children,
                            and attempted to conceal unfavorable information from the court. In re A.B. J.B., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 35, 781 S.E.2d 685 (2016), review denied, 793 S.E.2d 695, 2016 N.C. LEXIS

                            Trial court properly terminated a father's parental rights to his child because it took the father nearly a year after his initial participation in the case to obtain independent housing, and even then, his housing was not appropriate for the child, the
                            father used an alias to sign his lease and did not know who would be living in his residence, without the name of a roommate, the Department of Social Services had no way to verify whether the residence would provide a safe
                            environment for the child, and the father's completion of parenting classes amounted to nothing more than limited progress and did not rebut his failure to obtain adequate housing. In re J.A.K.,

                        <p>
                            Trial court's findings fully supported its conclusion that grounds exist to terminate the mother's parental rights as she willfully left the child in foster care for more than 12 months without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions that
                            led to her removal; the mother failed to participate in court-ordered visitation, to verifiably participate in substance abuse assessment or drug screenings, or to maintain housing and employment stability. In re C.J.,

                            Trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights for willfully leaving her children in foster care or a placement outside of the home for more than 12 months without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their
                            removal because she failed to comply with the components of her case plan addressing her parenting and mental health concerns; and, while she addressed the housing component of her case plan by moving from a motel room into
                            a house, she did so only a month before the termination hearing, which did not amount to reasonable progress in light of the fact that the children had been in the custody of the Youth and Family Services Division for over
                            three years. In re E.C., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Nov. 20, 2020).

                            Termination of the mother's parental rights on the ground that she willfully failed to make reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to the children's removal from her care was proper as she had continued to test positive for drugs and had
                            refused to comply with requested drug screens; and she never completed the domestic violence counseling ordered, and continued to relate and reside with the father whom she claimed set her on fire in front of the children.

                            Mother argued that she made reasonable progress, pointing to her participation in a program for people transitioning out of foster care, but her participation in that program alone was not sufficient to prevent or negate the conclusion that she failed
                            to make reasonable progress. In re Q.P.W., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 12, 2021).

                            tied to alleviating the conditions that contributed to the child's removal, namely the mother's immaturity and instability, yet she failed to maintain housing, attend parenting classes, cooperate with drug screens, and attend
                            visits with the child. In re Q.P.W., - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 12, 2021).

                            and domestic violence issues which led to the removal of the children. The court detailed the mother';s positive tests for marijuana, failure to complete substance abuse treatment and domestic violence counseling programs,

                            Diligence of DSS. - While the affidavit of the Department of Social Services (DSS) for service by publication under former G.S. 7A-289.27 may evidence the "due diligence" necessary for service under that statute, DSS's "due diligence" in serving its petition
                            did not determine whether it made "diligent efforts" to encourage and counsel family relationships for two consecutive years (now 12 months) prior to termination under subdivision (3) of this section. In re Harris,

                            Showing of Fault Not Required. - A finding of willfulness under this section does not require a showing of fault on the part of the parent; willfulness may be found where the parent, recognizing her inability to care for the child, voluntarily leaves
                            the child in foster care; therefore, where respondent had been afforded almost double the statutory 18-month period in which to demonstrate her willingness to correct the conditions which led to the removal of her children,
                            her failure to do so supported a finding of willfulness regardless of her good intentions. Buncombe County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Burks, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 375 S.E.2d

                            Leaving Held "Willful" - Evidence that although he was apparently not incarcerated during the entire two-year period being considered, father of one child never attempted to contact Department of Social Services (DSS) or child during that period, and
                            that father of the other child had been incarcerated throughout the period, and similarly never contacted DSS, but did call his child once at her foster home, demonstrated that respondents' leaving their children in foster
                            care was "willful." In re Harris, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 360 S.E.2d 485 (1987).

                            Where the record showed that although respondent initially participated in programs designed to improve her situation, she had largely abandoned these efforts, she had not followed through on her program of vocational training, and when the petition in
                            the case was filed, respondent had been traveling, her visitation with the children had been infrequent, and her social worker had difficulty in contacting her, the evidence supported a finding of willfulness under this section.

                            Where respondent entered several service agreements with DSS since her children were removed yet did not enroll in and complete the Step One program; attended substance abuse counseling only sporadically; did not attend AA meetings regularly; did not
                            complete parenting classes; did not abstain from the use of alcohol; failed to keep DSS informed of where she was living so that DSS could contact her about the children; showed up for visits smelling of alcohol and appearing
                            intoxicated; numerous police officers responded to disturbance calls at respondent's residence; and respondent had more than three and one-half times the statutory period of twelve months in which to take steps to improve her
                            situation, respondent's behavior supported a finding of willfulness. In re Nolen, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 453 S.E.2d 220 (1995).

                            Even though respondent attempted to regain custody of her child, willfulness could still be found under former G.S. 7A-289.32(3) because the child was left in foster care for over twelve months and respondent did not show reasonable progress or a positive
                            response toward the diligent efforts of the Department of Social Services. In re Oghenekevebe, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 473 S.E.2d 393 (1996).

                        <p>
                            Evidence clearly and convincingly established that mentally ill mother willfully left her child in foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress to correct the conditions which led to the child's placement when she was unwilling
                            to accept any responsibility for her situation and would not appropriately interact with her child. In re Fletcher, <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 558 S.E.2d 498 (2002).

                            There was clear, cogent, and convincing evidence to hold that a mother was willful in leaving her children in the custody of the Forsyth County Department of Social Services (DSS) for a time period well beyond the statutory period of 12 months where:
                            (1) she entered a mental hospital, which caused the initial removal of her children, and she did not seek return of their custody for several year, (2) she refused to acknowledge and treat the very conditions that led to her
                            loss of custody and even refused to acknowledge the medical diagnosis of her children; (3) this behavior indicted that, if returned to her custody, she would not pursue treatment for herself or her children; and (4) any attempt
                            to set up a visitation with the children by the diligence of DSS or the children's guardian ad litem was frustrated at the mother's own behest. In re Shepard, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>                            215, 591 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

                            in leaving the child for over 12 months in foster care, failing to make any progress toward unification, and engaging in sexual abuse with the child. In re B.D., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 620 S.E.2d 913

                            Termination of a mother's parental rights to her two minor children was upheld on appeal where the unchallenged findings of fact made by the trial court established by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in the record that the mother had willfully
                            left her children in foster care without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their placement. The findings supporting that conclusion included: the children were in foster care for over 12 months;
                            the mother missed seven out of eleven appointments and failed to complete a substance abuse treatment program; missed five out of ten parenting classes; tested positive for drugs several times; failed to establish a permanent
                            residence and had been moving around from family and friends for a total of eight separate residences; failed to obtain employment; and failed to stay in contact with the Department of Social Services. In re A.R.H.B.,

                        <p>
                            Evidence supported termination of the father's parental rights; although he did visit with the child seven times, that alone was not dispositive of the trial court's conclusion that, by making almost no efforts to have the child placed in his custody,
                            he willfully left the child in the custody of Youth and Family Services for more than 12 months. In re A.W, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 765 S.E.2d 111 (2014).

                        <p>
                            Evidence supported the finding that the mother acted willfully in failing to make reasonable progress toward correcting the conditions that led to the children's removal from her home, making termination proper; the mother refused to work with the in-home
                            aide provided by the department and she was afforded almost three years to achieve a home environment suitable for her children, plus the trial court had duly considered the mother's partial completion of her case plan as well
                            as her limited cognitive abilities. In re J.S., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 811</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 66 (2020).

                            Willful Leaving Not Shown. - Clear, cogent and convincing evidence did not show that the mother had willfully left her child in foster care without making reasonable progress toward resolving the problems which led to the child's foster care placement,
                            in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>. In re Nesbitt, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 349, 555 S.E.2d 659 (2001).

                        <p>
                            Evidence did not clearly and convincingly show father willfully left his child in foster care, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite>, where he attended visits with
                            the child, completed psychological evaluations and treatment, completed parenting classes and maintained contact with the Department of Social Services. In re Fletcher, <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 558 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            Where none of the court's findings touched directly on the mother's ability to provide her child with proper care, supervision and discipline, and the findings did not support the conclusion that the mother failed to make reasonable progress in correcting
                            the conditions that led to the child's removal, the court erred in finding the mother willfully left the child in foster care for 12 months. In re J.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite>                            678, 632 S.E.2d 237 (2006), rev'd, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 341</cite>, 643 S.E.2d 579 (2007).

                        <p>
                            Because the children were not removed from the mother more than twelve months prior to the termination hearing, termination of the mother's parental rights on the basis that she left the children in foster care of placement outside the home was not supported
                            by the evidence. In re A.G.M., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 773 S.E.2d 123 (2015).

                            Findings of fact were inadequate under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)</a></cite> where, at best, they showed that the child was placed with the mother's cousin and his wife
                            because the mother was going to take the child and move in with the child's father and that the parents had acted inconsistently with their rights as parents, but they did not identify the conditions that resulted in the involuntary
                            removal of the child from the mother. Moreover, it was unclear from the findings of fact that the mother was aware of the conditions or that she had the ability to correct the conditions, whatever they may have been. In re

                            Failure to Adequately Consider Mother's Age. - In a termination of parental rights action, the trial court failed to adequately address the mother's age, in terms of whether the mother willfully left the child in foster care for 12-months prior to the
                            filing of the petition. The mother's living in the same foster home as the child did not necessarily constitute willfully leaving the child in foster care. In re J.G.B., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                            375, 628 S.E.2d 450 (2006).

                            Child Adjudicated Dependent. - Evidence supported termination of the father's parental rights; the child had been placed in the custody of Youth and Family Services (YFS) as a result of being adjudicated dependent, and the conditions which led to the
                            child being placed in YFS custody were not necessarily tied to the fault of either parent, and instead, those conditions were based entirely on circumstances surrounding the child at the time he was adjudicated dependent, and
                            the father made almost no effort to either establish himself as a parent who could provide for the child, nor did he arrange alternative child care arrangements. In re A.W, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite>                            209, 765 S.E.2d 111 (2014).

                            Evidence Sufficient. - There was ample evidence showing that the Department of Social Services used reasonable efforts towards reunification, and thus the mother's argument that the trial court did not have the evidence it needed to find her behavior
                            was willful or that her progress was not reasonable for termination purposes was unavailing; there was clear evidence to support findings that the mother willfully left the children in foster care for more than 12 months and
                            failed to make reasonable progress. In re A.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 812 S.E.2d 875 (2018).

                            Former G.S. 7A-289.32(6)(d) does not require a finding that the putative father had the means and ability to pay child support, it only requires a showing that he in fact did not provide substantial support or consistent care to the child or the mother.

                            Knowledge of Child's Existence on Part of Father at Time of Filing Petition. - G.S. 48-6(a)(3) reflects the same legislative choices evident in the termination of a putative father's rights under former G.S. 7A-289.32(6); under neither statute is the
                            illegitimate child's future welfare dependent on whether or not the putative father knows of the child's existence at the time the petition is filed.

                            Termination of a father's parental rights was upheld on appeal since the father failed to challenge any of the findings of fact made by the trial court, namely that prior to the date the motion to terminate his parental rights was filed, he never established
                            paternity over the minor child at issue, never legitimated the child by statute or marriage, nor had he provided any financial support.

                            Mother's parental rights were improperly terminated on the ground of dependency - when the trial court determined that the mother was incapable of providing a safe, permanent home for the mother's child - because the mother divorced the abusive father,
                            confronted the mother's own history of violent domestic relationships to the satisfaction of treatment providers, displayed appropriate parenting techniques during visits with the child, and obtained a suitable residence with

                            Denial of an adoption agency's petition for the termination of a father's parental rights was reversed as the trial court did not find that the father, before the petition was filed, established paternity judicially, legitimated the child either through

                            Although the biological father argued that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding it was in the best interest of the minor child to terminate the biological father's parental rights because the biological father's mother was willing to take
                            custody of the minor child and it was unclear whether the minor child's foster parent would be able to adopt the minor child, the court found that nothing within <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1110" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1110</a></cite>                            required that termination lead to adoption in order for termination to be in a child's best interests, and the biological father had not taken any actions in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba11s7B-1111ol1a5" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1111(a)(5)</a></cite>                            exhibiting a parental interest in the minor child, which provided grounds for termination of his parental rights.

                            during the year before the termination petition was filed; consequently, because a proper decree for child support will be based on the supporting parent's ability to pay as well as the child's needs, there is no requirement

                            father had decided to remain sober and commit himself to a business endeavor as the court reasoned he could have applied the same effort he applied to the business project to paying child support, these findings did not support

                <p>
                    The process of selection of specific adoptive parents shall be the responsibility of and within the discretion of the county department of social services or licensed child-placing agency. In selecting the adoptive parents, any current placement provider
                    wanting to adopt the child shall be considered. The guardian ad litem may request information from and consult with the county department or child-placing agency concerning the selection process. If the guardian ad litem requests information
                    about the selection process, the county shall provide the information within five business days. The county department of social services shall notify the guardian ad litem and the foster parents of the selection of prospective adoptive
                    parents within 10 days of the selection and before the filing of the adoption petition. If the guardian ad litem disagrees with the selection of adoptive parents or the foster parents want to adopt the juvenile and were not selected
                    as adoptive parents, the guardian ad litem or foster parents shall file a motion within 10 days of the department's notification and schedule the case for hearing on the next juvenile calendar. The department shall not change the juvenile's
                    placement to the prospective adoptive parents unless the time period for filing a motion has expired and no motion has been filed. The Department shall provide a copy of a motion for judicial review of adoption selection to the foster
                    parents not selected. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make the foster parents a party to the proceeding solely based on receiving notification and the right to be heard by filing a motion. In hearing any motion, the court
                    shall consider the recommendations of the agency and the guardian ad litem and other facts related to the selection of adoptive parents. The court shall then determine whether the proposed adoptive placement is in the juvenile's best
                    interests.

                <p>
                    The General Assembly finds that it is the public policy of this State to prevent the abuse, neglect, and death of juveniles. The General Assembly further finds that the prevention of the abuse, neglect, and death of juveniles is a community responsibility;
                    that professionals from disparate disciplines have responsibilities for children or juveniles and have expertise that can promote their safety and well-being; and that multidisciplinary reviews of the abuse, neglect, and death of juveniles
                    can lead to a greater understanding of the causes and methods of preventing these deaths. It is, therefore, the intent of the General Assembly, through this Article, to establish a statewide multidisciplinary, multiagency child fatality
                    prevention system consisting of the State Team established in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba14s7B-1404" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1404</a></cite> and the Local Teams established in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba14s7B-1406" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1406</a></cite>.
                    The purpose of the system is to assess the records of selected cases in which children are being served by child protective services and the records of all deaths of children in North Carolina from birth to age 18 in order to (i) develop
                    a communitywide approach to the problem of child abuse and neglect, (ii) understand the causes of childhood deaths, (iii) identify any gaps or deficiencies that may exist in the delivery of services to children and their families by
                    public agencies that are designed to prevent future child abuse, neglect, or death, and (iv) make and implement recommendations for changes to laws, rules, and policies that will support the safe and healthy development of our children
                    and prevent future child abuse, neglect, and death.

                        The common thread running throughout the Juvenile Code (formerly <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa41s7A-516" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-516</a></cite>, et seq.) is that the court must consider the child's
                        best interests in making all placements whether at the dispositional hearing or the review hearing. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 303 S.E.2d 636 (1983), modified, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>,
                        319 S.E.2d 567 (1984).

                    <p>
                        The purpose of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7As0Va23s7A-277" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-277</a></cite> was to give to delinquent children the control and environment which might lead to their reformation
                        and enable them to become law abiding and useful citizens, a support and not a hindrance to the State. In re Whichard, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 174 S.E.2d 281 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 940, 91 S. Ct. 2258,
                        29 L. Ed. 2d 719 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Juvenile Hearing. - Former Subchapter XI of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7A</a></cite>, which contained the former North Carolina Juvenile Code, did not classify a juvenile hearing
                        as civil or criminal. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 161</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 405, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 956, 112 S. Ct. 414, 116 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1991).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Constitutional Rights at Juvenile Hearing. - There are certain constitutional rights which a juvenile has at a juvenile hearing which are not required in civil trials, such as the right to counsel if there is a possibility of commitment and the privilege
                        against self incrimination. This would suggest a juvenile hearing is not a civil case. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 161</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 405, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 956, 112 S. Ct. 414,

                    <p>
                        The court must consider the welfare of the delinquent child as well as the best interest of the State. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 251 S.E.2d 643 (1979).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        State's Interest in Juvenile Proceeding. - The fact that the proceeding is not an ordinary criminal prosecution, but is a juvenile proceeding, does not lessen, but should actually increase, the burden upon the State to see that the child's rights are
                        protected. In re Meyers, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 214 S.E.2d 268 (1975).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The district court's authority in juvenile dispositions is limited to utilization of currently existing programs or those for which the funding and machinery for implementation is in place. In re Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite>                        167, 352 S.E.2d 449 (1987).

                    <p>
                        The former North Carolina Juvenile Code (formerly <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa41s7A-516" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-516</a></cite> et seq.) did not grant the district courts the authority to order
                        the State, through the Division of Youth Services, to develop and implement specific treatment programs and facilities for juveniles. In re Swindell, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 473</cite>, 390 S.E.2d 134 (1990).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Court Order May Not Exceed Court's Authority. - When a student has been lawfully suspended or expelled pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115C.html#t115CsVIa27s115C-391" target="_blank">G.S. 115C-391</a></cite>                        and the school has not provided a suitable alternative educational forum, court-ordered public school attendance is not a dispositional alternative available to the juvenile court judge, absent a voluntary reconsideration of or
                        restructuring of the suspension by the school board to allow the student's restoration to an educational program within its system. In re Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 167, 352 S.E.2d 449 (1987).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Delinquency Proceedings May Result in Commitment. - Juvenile proceedings to determine delinquency, though not the same as criminal prosecutions of an adult, may nevertheless result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile's freedom is curtailed.
                        In re Meyers, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 214 S.E.2d 268 (1975).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dismissal of Petitions Against Juveniles Treated Unequally. - The trial court erred in not dismissing petitions against six juveniles who received unequal treatment relative to other juveniles who were alleged to have committed the same or similar offenses
                        by design, in that each respondent was prosecuted because he or she, or his or her parents, was unwilling or unable to pay $1,000 compensation to the victim, while the other juveniles, who were similarly situated, were not prosecuted
                        because they, or their parents, were able or willing to pay $1,000 thereto. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 352 S.E.2d 889 (1987).

                        Distinction Between Undisciplined and Delinquent Children Is Relevant to State's Objective. - In seeking solutions which provide in each case for the protection, treatment, rehabilitation and correction of the child, it is impellingly relevant to the
                        achievement of the State's objective that distinctions be made between undisciplined children on the one hand and delinquent children on the other. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 28</cite>,
                        191 S.E.2d 702 (1972).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence Sufficient to Convict of Crime Is Sufficient to Permit Finding of Delinquency. - Where there was sufficient evidence to convict the accused of the crime alleged in the petition, then there was sufficient evidence to permit a finding that the
                        accused was a delinquent child. State v. Rush, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 186 S.E.2d 595 (1972).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No Finding of Delinquency Where Evidence Insufficient to Convict Juvenile of Crime. - Where the evidence in a juvenile hearing was insufficient to convict the juvenile of the crime alleged in the petition, subornation of perjury, there could be no finding
                        that the juvenile was a delinquent. In re Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 174 S.E.2d 667 (1970).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Removal of Probation Violations from Definition of "Delinquent Child". - The amendment of former G.S. 7A-278(2), removing violation of probation from the definition of "delinquent child," indicated an intent that only criminal activity could provide the
                        basis for an adjudication of delinquency. The legislative purpose in removing probation violations as the basis for adjudications of delinquency would be frustrated if the courts were to take those very same violations, treat them
                        as criminal contempt, and then base adjudications of delinquency on the contempt proceedings. In re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 297 S.E.2d 168 (1982).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lack of Jurisdiction Found. - Because a district court never exercised jurisdiction over defendant for the charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, the superior court that convicted him never obtained jurisdiction via transfer of the charge; because
                        the trial court lacked jurisdiction over defendant for the conspiracy charge, his conviction was vacated. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 600 S.E.2d 16 (2004).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A motion to dismiss a petition seeking to declare a juvenile a delinquent was properly denied when there was substantial evidence that the juvenile respondent committed a criminal offense or violated a condition of a probationary judgment. In re Byers,
                        <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 256</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 665 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Facts Insufficient to Prove Child Delinquent. - On a petition alleging that a child of 12 was delinquent, as defined in former G.S. 7A-517(12) (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba15s7B-1501" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1501(7)</a></cite>),
                        where the State established only that the child entered an unlocked door into a lighted store during daylight hours, that he did so in front of at least one known witness, and that he took nothing, the State's evidence failed to
                        establish the elements of the crime charged (breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny) and dismissal of the action was improperly denied. In re Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 593, 291 S.E.2d 796 (1982).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Constitutionality. - The provisions of subdivision (5) of former G.S. 7A-278, defining "undisciplined child" (see now subdivision (27) of this section defining "undisciplined juvenile") were not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite. In re Walker,
                        <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 188 S.E.2d 731, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 28</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 702 (1972).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A finding in a juvenile commitment proceeding that a 15-year-old girl was beyond the disciplinary control of her parents or custodian and was therefore a delinquent child in need of the supervision, protection, and custody of the State, was sufficient
                        to bring the girl within the statutory definition of an "undisciplined child" (now see definition of "undisciplined juvenile"). In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 176 S.E.2d 849
                        (1970).

                        This Article vests exclusive, original jurisdiction over any case involving a child in the district court judge and provides in detail for procedures in the district court in cases involving children. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>,
                        187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-278 and G.S. 7A-279.

                    <p>
                        Nature of Proceedings. - As the district court division has exclusive original jurisdiction of Juvenile Code matters, actions under ther former Juvenile Code (formerly <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa41s7A-516" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-516</a></cite>                        et seq.) are not special proceedings.

                    <p>
                        Petition of Continuing Jurisdiction. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over children as of September 26, 1984, when service of summons was completed on parent, and on September 27, 1984, entered an order allowing Department of Social Services
                        (DSS) to retain temporary and legal custody of the children, retained continuing jurisdiction over the children. In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction over Juveniles. - Where defendant was twelve or thirteen at the time he committed the felony of crime against nature, but had subsequently become an adult, the district court had exclusive original jurisdiction, because for the purposes of
                        determining subject matter jurisdiction over a juvenile, age at the time of the alleged offense governs. State v. Dellinger, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 93</cite>, 468 S.E.2d 218 (1996).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was error for the court of appeals to vacate a juvenile's delinquency adjudication based on a sexual battery charge on the grounds that a juvenile court counselor (JCC) did not comply with the timelines contained in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba17s7B-1703" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1703</a></cite>,
                        when the JCC had filed a petition alleging the juvenile committed simple assault and then filed a second petition, based on the same incident, alleging the juvenile committed sexual battery, on the grounds that the alleged failure
                        to comply with these timelines deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction, because the legislature did not intend <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba17s7B-1703" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1703</a></cite>'s timing requirements
                        to be jurisdictional, as the legislature did not mention jurisdiction in the statute or state a JCC's failure to meet the statutory timing requirements divested a court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re D.S., <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 184</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction over Neglect and Dependency Proceedings. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter when the summons was served upon mother, although it was not served upon father, as required by former G.S. 7A-565, had the authority
                        to decide the issue of neglect and dependency of three children. In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).

                        Affidavit Not Required. - Where the court obtained jurisdiction over a juvenile matter pursuant to former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa42s7A-523" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-523</a></cite>, and not

                    <p>
                        Power to Order Sex Offender Treatment. - The district court had power to order the Department of Human Resources, Division of Youth Services to give sex offender treatment to an adolescent found delinquent because of sex offenses and subsequently to deny
                        the conditional release of that adolescent because treatment had not been in compliance with that mandate. In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 743</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 798 (1991).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ordering Division of Youth Services to provide specific treatment for sexual offenders for a delinquent juvenile in its custody, when such treatment was available, was within the scope of the court's statutory authority. In re Doe,
                        <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 743</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 798 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Lack of Jurisdiction Found. - Because a district court never exercised jurisdiction over defendant for the charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, the superior court that convicted him never obtained jurisdiction via transfer of the charge; because
                        the trial court lacked jurisdiction over defendant for the conspiracy charge, his conviction was vacated. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 600 S.E.2d 16 (2004).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adult Convictions. - State court's records relating to defendant's 1995 convictions revealed that they were adult convictions; although a seventeen-year-old could be tried in North Carolina as either a juvenile or an adult,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba22s7B-2200" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2200</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba22s7B-2203" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2203</a></cite>, North Carolina's district courts possessed exclusive,
                        original jurisdiction over any case involving a juvenile who was alleged to be delinquent, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba16s7B-1601" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1601</a></cite>, thus, if defendant was tried and convicted as a juvenile,
                        he could have been prosecuted only in a North Carolina district court. The judgments underlying defendant's 1995 convictions, however, demonstrated that he was convicted and sentenced in the Superior Court of Surry County, North
                        Carolina, and his 1995 Convictions were therefore necessarily adult convictions. United States v. Allen, 446 F.3d 522 (4th Cir. 2006).

                        This Article vests exclusive, original jurisdiction over any case involving a child in the district court judge and provides in detail for procedures in the district court in cases involving children. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>,
                        187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-278 and G.S. 7A-279.

                    <p>
                        Nature of Proceedings. - As the district court division has exclusive original jurisdiction of Juvenile Code matters, actions under ther former Juvenile Code (formerly <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa41s7A-516" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-516</a></cite>                        et seq.) are not special proceedings. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Petition of Continuing Jurisdiction. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over children as of September 26, 1984, when service of summons was completed on parent, and on September 27, 1984, entered an order allowing Department of Social Services
                        (DSS) to retain temporary and legal custody of the children, retained continuing jurisdiction over the children. In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction over Juveniles. - Where defendant was twelve or thirteen at the time he committed the felony of crime against nature, but had subsequently become an adult, the district court had exclusive original jurisdiction, because for the purposes of
                        determining subject matter jurisdiction over a juvenile, age at the time of the alleged offense governs. State v. Dellinger, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 93</cite>, 468 S.E.2d 218 (1996).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Crime Committed When Defendant Was 16 Years Old. - As there was substantial evidence that defendant was 16 during the time frame when he sexually abused the victim, the superior court had jurisdiction over the matter under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba16s7B-1604ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1604(a)</a></cite>. State v. Pettigrew, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 693 S.E.2d 698 (2010), dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 439</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction clearly existed in the superior court for the fourth count of first-degree rape of a child, as the indictment alleged a period of time which included a time when defendant was 16 years old and clearly under the jurisdiction of the superior
                        court. State v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 783 S.E.2d 9 (2016).

                    <p>
                        No Evidence Defendant Was 16 Years Old at Time of Offense. - Defendant's convictions for three counts of first-degree rape of a child had to be vacated because the superior court was without subject matter jurisdiction due to the fact that no evidence
                        presented at trial showed that defendant was at least 16 years old at the time those offenses were committed. State v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 783 S.E.2d 9 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction over Neglect and Dependency Proceedings. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter when the summons was served upon mother, although it was not served upon father, as required by former G.S. 7A-565, had the authority
                        to decide the issue of neglect and dependency of three children. In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Affidavit Not Required. - Where the court obtained jurisdiction over a juvenile matter pursuant to former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa42s7A-523" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-523</a></cite>, and not

                        In re Botsford, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 72, 330 S.E.2d 23 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Power to Order Sex Offender Treatment. - The district court had power to order the Department of Human Resources, Division of Youth Services to give sex offender treatment to an adolescent found delinquent because of sex offenses and subsequently to deny
                        the conditional release of that adolescent because treatment had not been in compliance with that mandate. In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 743</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 798 (1991).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ordering Division of Youth Services to provide specific treatment for sexual offenders for a delinquent juvenile in its custody, when such treatment was available, was within the scope of the court's statutory authority. In re Doe,
                        <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 743</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 798 (1991).

                        Jurisdiction over Neglect and Dependency Proceedings. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter when the summons was served upon mother, although it was not served upon father, as required by former G.S. 7A-565, had the authority
                        to decide the issue of neglect and dependency of three children. In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Retention of Continuing Jurisdiction. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over children as of September 26, 1984, when service of summons was completed on parent, and on September 27, 1984, entered an order allowing Department of Social Services

                    jurisdiction of the court, to determine whether the facts alleged are sufficiently serious to warrant court action, and to obtain assistance from community resources when court referral is not necessary. The juvenile court counselor
                    shall not engage in field investigations to substantiate complaints or to produce supplementary evidence but may refer complainants to law enforcement agencies for those purposes.

                <p>
                    When a complaint is received, the juvenile court counselor shall make a preliminary determination as to whether the juvenile is within the jurisdiction of the court as a delinquent or undisciplined juvenile. If the juvenile court counselor finds that
                    the facts contained in the complaint do not state a case within the jurisdiction of the court, that legal sufficiency has not been established, or that the matters alleged are frivolous, the juvenile court counselor, without further
                    inquiry, shall refuse authorization to file the complaint as a petition.

                <p>
                    If a complaint against the juvenile has not been previously received, as determined by the juvenile court counselor, the juvenile court counselor shall make reasonable efforts to meet with the juvenile and the juvenile's parent, guardian, or custodian
                    if the offense is divertable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When requested by the juvenile court counselor, the prosecutor shall assist in determining the sufficiency of evidence as it affects the quantum of proof and the elements of offenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The juvenile court counselor, without further inquiry, shall authorize the complaint to be filed as a petition if the juvenile court counselor finds reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile has committed one of the following nondivertible offenses:

                        Prior Approval of Filing of Petition Required. - Before a juvenile petition may be filed charging any juvenile with being delinquent or undisciplined, the record must affirmatively disclose that either the intake counselor or the district attorney has

                        legal sufficiency and jurisdiction supporting the complaint, making victim contact unnecessary, as the JCC thoroughly considered the crimes' seriousness, an assault victim's existence, and appellant's juvenile history, and (2)
                        the legislature intended use of statutory investigative methods only "if practicable." In re T.H., <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 123, 721 S.E.2d 728 (2012).

                        Prevention (DJJDP) and determine whether the filing of a petition against a juvenile respondent was necessary, and the statute merely provides methods by which the JCC can obtain information to evaluate the DJJDP factors, but the

                        offenses by design, in that each respondent was prosecuted because he or she, or his or her parents, was unwilling or unable to pay $1,000 compensation to victim, while the other juveniles, who were similarly situated, were not
                        prosecuted because they, or their parents, were able or willing to pay $1,000 to victim. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 352 S.E.2d 889 (1987).

                        to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba17s7B-1703" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1703</a></cite>; the timely filing of a petition seeking judicial action was jurisdictional. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite>                        301, 650 S.E.2d 457 (2007).

                        Trial court erred by adjudicating a juvenile delinquent as a result of the juvenile court counselor failing to file the petition within the 15-day period following the filing of the complaint as mandated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba17s7B-1703ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1703(b)</a></cite>;
                        thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide the matter. In re K.W., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 812, 664 S.E.2d 66 (2008).

                        when the JCC had filed a petition alleging the juvenile committed simple assault and then filed a second petition, based on the same incident, alleging the juvenile committed sexual battery, because the JCC complied with the statute's
                        timelines, requiring the JCC to file a petition within 15 days of receiving a complaint, since (1) the JCC filed the sexual battery petition one day after receiving a complaint alleging the juvenile committed sexual battery, (2)
                        the JCC was not required to investigate the facts underlying the prior, simple assault, complaint to determine if the facts supported the filing of a petition alleging sexual battery, and, (3) while the assault complaint alleged
                        the juvenile touched a victim on the victim's buttocks and between the victim's legs, that complaint did not allege the juvenile committed sexual battery or touched the victim for purposes of sexual arousal or gratification. In

                        Fatal Variance Between Juvenile Petition and Evidence. - There was a fatal variance between the juvenile petition and the evidence where the petition, which charged a first-degree sexual offense based on the parties' ages, was fatally defective because
                        it did not allege the ages of the victim and the juvenile. In re Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 487, 592 S.E.2d 12 (2004).

                        Jurisdiction. - The issuance and service of process is the means by which the court obtains jurisdiction; thus, where no summons was issued, the court acquired jurisdiction over neither the persons nor the subject matter of the action, and was without

                    The summons and petition shall be personally served upon the parent, the guardian, or custodian and the juvenile not less than five days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing. The time for service may be waived in the discretion of the court.

                        Trial Court Is Without Jurisdiction Where No Notice Was Served. - A trial court did not have jurisdiction to enter orders in a juvenile delinquency proceeding where no summons, petition or other notice was ever served on the juvenile or her parents, guardian
                        or custodian prior to any of the hearings. In re McAllister, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 614, 188 S.E.2d 723 (1972).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Trial Court Properly Exercised Personal Jurisdiction over Juvenile. - Trial court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over the juvenile on a simple assault petition, as the juvenile's and the juvenile's parent's presence at the hearing on that petition
                        as well as the juvenile's participation in the hearing without objection constituted a general appearance for the purposes of waiving any defect in service. In re Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite>                        102, 568 S.E.2d 878 (2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not lack personal jurisdiction over defendant juvenile even though service of process was not made five days prior to the hearing as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba18s7B-1806" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1806</a></cite>,
                        where neither defendant nor his counsel contested service of process or personal jurisdiction at any of the numerous hearings they participated in. In re D.S.B., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 577, 634 S.E.2d 633 (2006).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Statement on return that service was accomplished implies that it was done in the manner required by law. In re Leggett, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 745, 314 S.E.2d 144 (1984).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        It is the service of summons, rather than the return of the officer, that confers jurisdiction. In re Leggett, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 745, 314 S.E.2d 144 (1984); In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite>                        550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Failure of Record to Show Time and Manner of Service. - Failure of a record of a juvenile delinquency proceeding to show the exact time and manner of service of the summons and petition upon the juvenile and his parents was not fatal where the record
                        affirmatively showed that the juvenile and his mother were in fact accorded sufficient notice of the hearing at which he was adjudicated delinquent to provide adequate opportunity to prepare, that at least seven days prior to the
                        hearing he had been represented by privately employed counsel, and that he was represented by such counsel at the hearing, which had already been once continued. In re Collins, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite>                        142, 182 S.E.2d 662 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Service on Only One Parent Required. - In order to have a child declared dependent, it is not necessary to serve the petition on both parents, but only on one of them or the guardian or custodian. In re Yow, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite>                        688, 253 S.E.2d 647, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 610</cite>, 257 S.E.2d 223 (1979).

                    <p>
                        U.S. Const., Amend. XIV did not proscribe a finding of dependency binding upon the mother of a child so that his custody could be placed with a suitable person, where the mother was not served with any notice before the first hearing, but where the facts
                        showed that his father was served with notice, and it was found as a fact that the mother's address was unknown and no evidence to dispute the finding was in the record. In re Yow, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite>                        688, 253 S.E.2d 647, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 610</cite>, 257 S.E.2d 223 (1979).

                        Jurisdiction Acquired by Service on One Parent. - Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter when the summons was served upon mother, although it was not served upon father as required by this section, had the authority to decide
                        the issue of neglect and dependency of three children. In re Arends, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 364 S.E.2d 169 (1988).

                        Secure Custody Not Authorized Solely for Alleged Probation Violation. - Subsection (c) of this section does not authorize issuance of a secure custody order for a juvenile who has previously been adjudicated delinquent simply because the juvenile is now
                        alleged to have violated the terms of her probation. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

                        Jurisdiction Required. - Subdivision (d) of this section requires that the trial court have jurisdiction before exercising the powers granted thereunder. In re Transp. of Juveniles, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 806,
                        403 S.E.2d 557 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Standard of Proof for Termination and Removal Distinguished. - There is a substantive difference between the quantum of adequate proof of neglect and dependency for purposes of termination and for purposes of removal. The most significant difference is
                        that while parental rights may not be terminated for threatened future harm, the Department of Social Services may obtain temporary custody of a child when there is a risk of neglect in the future. In re Evans,
                        <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 344 S.E.2d 325 (1986).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The task at the temporary custody or removal stage is to determine whether the child is exposed to a substantial risk of physical injury because the parent is unable to provide adequate protection. In re Evans, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                        449, 344 S.E.2d 325 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Removal of Child Upheld. - Evidence held sufficient to show that seven-year old child was exposed to a substantial risk of physical injury because of her mother's inability to maintain secure living arrangements for her, so as to permit the Department
                        of Social Services to remove her from her mother's custody until such accommodations could be provided. In re Evans, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 344 S.E.2d 325 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Secure Custody Pending Disposition Proper. - Trial court properly ordered that a juvenile be confined to secure custody pending disposition pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba19s7B-1903ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1903(c)</a></cite>                        because the juvenile had previously been adjudicated as delinquent, she admitted to subsequent probation violations, and the trial court had good cause to continue the dispositional hearing; when a juvenile has been previously
                        adjudicated delinquent and admits violations of his or her probation at an adjudication hearing, the juvenile may be ordered into secure custody pending disposition pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba19s7B-1903ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1903(c)</a></cite>.
                        In re D.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 679 S.E.2d 449 (2009), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 214</cite> (2010).

                    <p>
                        Secure Custody Pending Transfer to Out-of-Home Placement Proper. - Trial court had ample justification for its decision to hold the juvenile in secure custody pending his transfer to an out-of-home placement because the juvenile had been adjudicated delinquent
                        by the trial court and had been found to be in violation of the terms and conditions of his probation; the juvenile had been suspended from school, had anger-related difficulties, and had disobedience problems while living at home;
                        and, if the juvenile was kept in secure custody, the juvenile would go to school, get an education, and receive any medication and treatment he needed. In re Z.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite>                        365, 767 S.E.2d 660 (2014).

                        Juvenile Entitled to Hearing at Intervals of No More Than Ten Calendar Days. - Trial court erred by failing to entertain a juvenile's motion to review an order of secure custody under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba19s7B-1906ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1906(b)</a></cite>;
                        because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba19s7B-1903" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1903</a></cite> provides for secure custody during both pre-adjudication and post-adjudication, pending disposition, there is no reason that <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba19s7B-1906ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1906(b)</a></cite>                        hearings should be limited to pre-adjudication confinement, and a juvenile confined to secure custody pending disposition or placement is entitled to a hearing at intervals of no more than ten calendar days to determine whether
                        continued secure custody is warranted. In re D.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 679 S.E.2d 449 (2009), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 214</cite> (2010).

                    for secure custody, copies of the petition and custody order shall accompany the juvenile to the detention facility or holdover facility of the jail. A message of the Department of Public Safety stating that a juvenile petition and

                        be held at intervals of no more than 30 calendar days. Further hearings may be waived only with the consent of the juvenile, through counsel for the juvenile. Upon request of the juvenile, through counsel for the juvenile, and

                        Statute Inapplicable. - Because this statute applies when the trial court holds a hearing to determine whether to continue a juvenile's secure custody following an initial accusation of delinquency rather than when the trial court orders that a juvenile
                        be held in secure custody pending the effectuation of a legally authorized out-of-home placement, this statute was not applicable to the trial court's decision that the juvenile be held in secure custody pending his transfer to
                        an out-of-home placement. In re Z.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 365, 767 S.E.2d 660 (2014).

                        The determination of "reasonable efforts" under former G.S. 7A-577(h) is a conclusion of law because it requires the exercise of judgment; appellate review of a trial court's conclusions of law is limited to whether they are supported by findings of fact.
                        In re Helms, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 491 S.E.2d 672 (1997).

                        Reasonable Efforts Shown. - The DSS made reasonable efforts to prevent child's removal from her home where the DSS entered into four different protection plans with the mother regarding the care and protection of the child in an effort by DSS to stabilize
                        the child's home environment and protect her from violent individuals and drugs, and to encourage the mother to apply for food stamps, AFDC, and Medicaid. In re Helms, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite>                        505, 491 S.E.2d 672 (1997).

                        Hearing on five petitions alleging abuse, neglect, and/or dependency was clearly denominated a hearing to determine the need for continued custody. The judge therefore had the discretion to either continue nonsecure custody or to return the children to
                        their home; he did not have the authority to dismiss the petitions because in so doing he made an unauthorized determination of the merits of the case. There is no express statutory authority allowing the judge to dismiss the petitions
                        at a five-day hearing. In re Guarante, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. App.</cite> 598, 427 S.E.2d 883 (1993).

                <p>
                    In any case when no parent, guardian, or custodian appears in a hearing with the juvenile or when the court finds it would be in the best interests of the juvenile, the court may appoint a guardian of the person for the juvenile. The guardian shall operate
                    under the supervision of the court with or without bond and shall file only such reports as the court shall require. Unless the court orders otherwise, the guardian:
                </p>

                    <li id="t7Ba20s7B-2001ol11">

                        May consent to certain actions on the part of the juvenile in place of the parent or custodian, including (i) marriage, (ii) enlisting in the Armed Forces of the United States, and (iii) enrollment in school.

                <p>

                    <p>
                        Applicability of Section. - Whether defendant is a juvenile delinquent is irrelevant to a consideration of whether he is entitled to the protections of former G.S. 7A-595. State v. Fincher, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 1</cite>,
                        305 S.E.2d 685 (1983).

                    <p>
                        The rights afforded under this section to be informed of Miranda rights, as well as to have a parent, guardian, or custodian present during questioning, apply only to a person defined to be a juvenile under G.S. 7A-517 (see now
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba01s7B-101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-101</a></cite>), i.e., a person under the age of eighteen who is neither married, emancipated, nor in the military. State v. Brantley, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite>                        725, 501 S.E.2d 676 (1998).

                    <p>
                        "Guardian." - Confession of 13-year-old, taken in the presence of his aunt, was properly admitted in evidence; though the aunt was not his legal guardian or custodian, because she clothed, housed, and fed him, and enrolled him in school, she acted as
                        his "guardian" for purposes of this section. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 556 S.E.2d 644 (2001), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 351</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Despite juvenile's contention that his aunt was his guardian, his suppression motion was properly denied, as she was not considered a "party listed" under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba21s7B-2101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2101</a></cite>,
                        and the aunt never lived with the juvenile, did not have custody of him, nor acted on his behalf as a parent or his guardian. State v. Oglesby, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 658, 622 S.E.2d 152 (2005), aff'd in part,
                        vacated in part, review improvidently allowed in part, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 550</cite>, 648 S.E.2d 819 (2007).

                    <p>
                        "Aunt" Was Not Enumerated Relation. - Denial of defendant's motion to suppress defendant's statement to officers was proper because, although defendant was age 16 at the time of the interrogation, and detectives did not cease questioning when defendant
                        requested to phone defendant's aunt, an "aunt" was not enumerated relation in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba21s7B-2101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2101</a></cite> and defendant had no right to have her present
                        during questioning. State v. Oglesby, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 550</cite>, 648 S.E.2d 819 (2007).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Former G.S. 7A-595 set out mandatory procedures which to be followed when juvenile is interrogated by a law-enforcement officer. In re Riley, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 749, 301 S.E.2d 750 (1983).

                        Miranda Rights Explanation. - An interrogating officer need not explain the Miranda rights (Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966)) in any greater detail than what is required by Miranda, even when the suspect is a minor. State v. Flowers,

        Custodial Interrogation Factors.
       </b> - Presence of a school resource officer (SRO) or other law enforcement officer while a student is interrogated by a school official weighs heavily on the scale when determining whether what otherwise might appear to
                        be a voluntary encounter is instead a custodial interrogation; Involvement of an SRO in the questioning a child is a factor which is relevant, but not by itself dispositive, to the question of whether the encounter between a child
                        and a school official is a custodial interrogation. Court still must look to all of the remaining Miranda factors. In re D.A.H., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 20, 2021).

                        Juvenile's rights under this section arise only if the juvenile is in custody. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 100</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 518 (1986), overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 332</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Right of Juvenile to Have Parent Present. - Under U.S. Const., Amends. V and VI, an accused, having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation until counsel has been made available to him,
                        unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges or conversations with the police. A juvenile's right, pursuant to subdivision (a)(3) of former G.S. 7A-595, to have a parent present during custodial interrogation
                        is entitled to similar protection. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 100</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 518 (1986), overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 332</cite>,

                    <p>
                        When juvenile invoked the right to have a parent present during the interrogation, all interrogation should have ceased; since it did not, the trial court erred by denying the juvenile's motion to suppress the statement, which was elicited in violation
                        of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba21s7B-2101ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2101(d)</a></cite>. State v. Branham, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 91, 569 S.E.2d 24 (2002).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was evidentiary support for a trial court's determination that defendant juvenile's parents were in close proximity when he was talking to police officers for purposes of his challenge to an inculpatory statement that he made, which he alleged required
                        suppression under Miranda and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba21s7B-2101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2101</a></cite>; based on their location in their house while the juvenile talked to the police outside,
                        they were near at hand during the questioning process. In re D.A.C., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 741 S.E.2d 378 (2013).

                        Although defendant, a juvenile, asked to call his mother, he never gave any indication that he wanted to have her present for his interrogation, nor did he condition his interview on first speaking with her, he simply asked to call her, and thus, defendant's
                        statement was at best an ambiguous invocation of his right to have his mother present under N.C. Gen. Stat.

                        statement was at best an ambiguous invocation of his right to have his mother present under this section, which did not require cessation of questioning. State v. Saldierna, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 401</cite>,
                        794 S.E.2d 474 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Statutory language is clearly intended to codify the rights afforded to a juvenile subjected to custodial interrogation pursuant to Miranda in addition to affording a juvenile the State statutory right to have a parent, guardian, or custodian present
                        during the interrogation process. State v. Saldierna, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 407</cite>, 817 S.E.2d 174 (2018).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where juvenile defendant was not informed of his right to have a parent, guardian or custodian present during questioning, there can be no finding that such defendant knowingly, willingly, and understandingly waived this privilege. State v. Fincher,
                        <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 1</cite>, 305 S.E.2d 685 (1983).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The failure to advise juvenile defendant of his right to have a parent, custodian or guardian present during questioning is not an error of constitutional magnitude, because this privilege is statutory in origin and does not emanate from the Constitution.
                        Therefore, the standard set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa91s15A-1443ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1443(a)</a></cite> must be applied to determine whether the
                        erroneous admission into evidence of defendant's statements to police officers was sufficient to warrant a new trial. State v. Fincher, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 1</cite>, 305 S.E.2d 685 (1983).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        There was no custodial interrogation where juvenile defendant was repeatedly told he was not under arrest and was free to leave at any time, and where he signed a statement wherein he stated that he was not under arrest and was giving a statement voluntarily.
                        State v. Gaines, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 647</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 396, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 900, 118 S. Ct. 248, 139 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1997).

                        Law enforcement officials are not required to inform a juvenile that his parents or attorney are actually present before taking his voluntary confession, and their failure to do so does not render the juvenile's confession involuntary as a matter of law
                        or otherwise inadmissible. State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 142</cite>, 463 S.E.2d 193 (1995).

                    <p>
                        The following warnings were sufficient to satisfy former G.S. 7A-595 and Miranda, even though the juvenile statute contains no requirement of indigency or financial need in order to obtain a court-appointed attorney: "You have the right to remain silent
                        . . . Anything you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions and to have him with you during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer one will be appointed
                        for you before questioning if you wish. You have the right to have your parent, guardian, or custodian with you during questioning. If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer, parent, guardian or custodian present,
                        you will still have the right to stop answering questions at any time until you talk to a lawyer, parent, guardian, or custodian." State v. McKeithan, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 537
                        S.E.2d 526 (2000).

                        The failure to warn in accordance with this section must be raised in a motion to suppress and must be argued in the trial court. State v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 194</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 345 (1984).

                        Parent May Not Waive Rights of Juvenile. - Finding that respondent's mother freely, understandingly, and knowingly waived respondent's juvenile rights is not equivalent to a finding that respondent knowingly and understandingly waived his rights. Furthermore,
                        a parent, guardian, or custodian may not waive any right on behalf of the juvenile. In re Ewing, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 535, 350 S.E.2d 887 (1986).

                        When a juvenile's confession was obtained without the juvenile's parent being present because the parent had voluntarily absented himself from the interrogation, the fact that the parent voluntarily absented himself did not allow the confession to be
                        admissible against the juvenile, under subdivisions (a)(3) and (b) of this section, because the parent could not waive the juvenile's right to have the parent present during the interrogation. In re Butts,

                        Failure to Object at Trial Waives Argument on Appeal. - In a capital murder trial, defendant's failure to object at trial to the State's introduction of his out-of-court statement on grounds that he was not advised of his rights under subsection (a) of
                        former G.S. 7A-595 waived his right to complain of its admission on appeal. State v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 1</cite>, 352 S.E.2d 653 (1987).

                        Findings Required. - This section clearly provides that before any statement flowing from custodial interrogation is admitted the judge must make the required findings. In re Riley, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 749,
                        301 S.E.2d 750 (1983).

                    <p>
                        This section requires the trial court to find as a fact that the juvenile knowingly, willingly, and understandingly waived his juvenile rights prior to admitting any statement made by the juvenile during a custodial interrogation. In re Ewing,
                        <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 535, 350 S.E.2d 887 (1986).

                    <p>
                        When a juvenile challenged the admission of his confession because it was obtained without the juvenile's parent present, as the parent had voluntarily absented himself from the juvenile's interrogation, it was error for the trial court to fail to determine
                        whether the juvenile was in custody when the confession was obtained. In re Butts, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 582 S.E.2d 279 (2003), review improvidently allowed, appeal dismissed sub
                        nom. In re T.R.B., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 370</cite>, 595 S.E.2d 146 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Where the court's statement contained nothing that could be construed as a factual finding that juvenile's confession was made in the presence of his parent, guardian, custodian or attorney, as required by subsection (b) of former G.S. 7A-595, the case
                        would be remanded for a finding on compliance with former G.S. 7A-595(b). In re Young, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 440, 337 S.E.2d 185 (1985).

                        Confession Held Inadmissible. - Juvenile's confession which resulted from police-initiated custodial interrogation in the absence of counsel or a parent after the juvenile invoked his right to have a parent present during questioning was erroneously admitted.

                        In a delinquency proceeding, the trial court erred by failing to suppress the juvenile's incriminating statements made while he was detained by school officials as the juvenile, while he was being detained, was treated in such a way that a reasonable
                        person in his situation would have believed he was functionally under arrest; juvenile gave incriminating statements in the course of custodial interrogation without being afforded Miranda warnings and the warnings required under

                        Statement Should Have Been Suppressed. - Statements a police officer made to a juvenile during a traffic stop while the juvenile was in investigative detention, handcuffed, and in the back of a patrol car were designed to elicit an incriminating response;
                        thus, a statement made to the officer should have been suppressed as the juvenile had not been informed of the juvenile's rights under Miranda or <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba21s7B-2101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2101</a></cite>.

                        Admission of Statement of Juvenile. - Although the trial record did not contain the findings required by former G.S. 7A-595(d), admission of defendant's statement at trial was not prejudicial because it was not inculpatory. It merely gave somewhat differing
                        versions of the defendant's whereabouts on the day in question. State v. Small, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 175</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 413 (1991).

                        Court of appeals erred in reversing an order adjudicating defendant juvenile a delinquent on the ground that he unlawfully and willfully possessed a weapon on school property because the trial court did not err in admitting, without objection, defendant's
                        statement that he possessed the knife on school property; the supreme court was not prepared to conclude that the school resource officer's presence and participation during the interrogation of defendant at the request of school
                        administrators conducting the investigation rendered the questioning of defendant a custodial interrogation requiring Miranda warnings and the protections of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba21s7B-2101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2101</a></cite>,
                        and because no motion to suppress defendant's statement was made, no evidence was presented and no findings were made as to either the officer's actual participation in the questioning or the custodial or noncustodial nature of
                        the interrogation or as to whether the statements were freely and voluntarily made. In re W.R., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 244</cite>, 675 S.E.2d 342 (2009).

                        In a delinquency proceeding in which a juvenile appealed the affirmation of the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress, the juvenile was not entitled to the protections of the Miranda decision and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba21s7B-2101ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2101(a)</a></cite>                        because he had not been in custody when he confessed to four crimes. He had been escorted from class to a conference room, where a police investigator was present along with an assistant principal, one of the assistant principal's
                        interns, and the school resource officer, and there was no indication in the trial court's findings that the juvenile had been restrained in any way or that anyone stood guard at the conference room door, which had been closed,
                        but not locked. In re J.D.B., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 664</cite>, 686 S.E.2d 135 (2009), rev'd, remanded, 131 S. Ct. 2394, 2011 U.S. LEXIS 4557, 180 L. Ed. 2d 310 (U.S. 2011).

                        free to leave test that had long been used for determining, under the Fourth Amendment, whether a person had been seized. In re J.D.B., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 664</cite>, 686 S.E.2d 135 (2009), rev'd, remanded, 131 S. Ct.

                        Murder defendant's offer during an interrogation to continue speaking with the officers the next day was an indication not that he did not wish to be questioned further, but rather that he was perfectly willing to talk with the officers. State v. Clodfelter,
                        <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 60, 691 S.E.2d 22 (2010).

                        Defendant juvenile's claim that given that he was attempting to leave the scene of the accident by walking briskly away at the time of an officer's arrival, the fact that he remained on the scene after being stopped by the officer meant that he was in
                        custody for purposes of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba21s7B-2101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2101</a></cite> was rejected as defendant did not show that the officer's inquiry subjected him to even a minimal
                        restraint on his freedom of movement or his ability to act as he chose; even if defendant did not feel free to go anywhere he wished at the time of his conversation with the officer, the fact that a defendant was not free to leave
                        did not necessarily constitute custody for purposes of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). In re A.N.C., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 315, 750 S.E.2d 835 (2013), review denied <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 269</cite>,

                        Spontaneous Statement to Law Enforcement. - Juvenile's statement to a sheriff's corporal and a high school principal, upon their discovering $59 in his pants pockets, that the money "was not from selling drugs" but was his mother's rent money, was properly
                        admitted because it was unsolicited and spontaneous, and not made at the questioning of the corporal. In re D.L.D., <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 694 S.E.2d 395 (2010).

                        Subsequent Statement Admissible Where Defendant Initiated Communication. - Defendant's subsequent statement was admissible where defendant stated that he did not wish to answer any questions, but then, upon considering his mother's statement, he turned
                        to the police officer and nodded his head affirmatively, after which the detective asked defendant if he then wished to answer questions without a lawyer present and the defendant answered "yes." State v. Johnson,

                        An Unambiguous Invocation of Defendant's Right to Silence. - Trial court did not commit plain error by admitting the portion of defendant's statement concerning a jeep which his brother co-defendant shot at where the agent witness's testimony indicated
                        that defendant's statement was not an unambiguous invocation of his right to silence. State v. Golphin, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 364</cite>, 533 S.E.2d 168 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 931, 121 S.

                        Waiver of Rights. - The additional language added to the adult rights form adequately conveyed the substance of juvenile defendant's right to have his mother present during questioning; it was clear defendant understood this right, and his actions were
                        a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 658</cite>, 477 S.E.2d 915 (1996).

                    <p>
                        A defendant's youth or subnormal mental capacity does not necessarily render him incapable of waiving his rights knowingly and voluntarily. State v. Flowers, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 497 S.E.2d 94 (1998).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A juvenile knowingly, voluntarily, and understandingly waived her rights, where she admitted to her family and then to a police officer that she and her boyfriend stole money from her grandparents, and after being taken into custody waived her right to
                        have a parent or guardian present and signed a waiver of rights form. State v. Brantley, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 725, 501 S.E.2d 676 (1998).

                        Trial court did not err in denying his motion to suppress his incriminating statement on the ground that it was obtained in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba21s7B-2101" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2101</a></cite>; although
                        he invoked his right to have his mother present during questioning, defendant later initiated further communication and waived right. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 705 S.E.2d 409 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Defendant juvenile did not invoke his right to have his mother present and validly waived this right; considering evidence supporting the finding that defendant's initialing of the line on the Juvenile Waiver of Rights form, that his mother was with him,
                        was an error, and considering evidence supporting the finding that defendant did not request his mother or ask to contact her, defendant never invoked his right to have his mother present for questioning, and that the evidence
                        could have been interpreted differently was not a basis to reverse the trial court. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 173, 792 S.E.2d 171 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred by concluding that the juvenile defendant knowingly, willingly, and understandingly waived his rights under the constitution or this section because defendant was 16 years old, he had only obtained an eighth grade education, Spanish
                        was his primary language, he was not familiar with the criminal justice system, the record indicated that he did not fully understand the detective's questions, no copy of the Spanish version of the juvenile waiver of rights form
                        existed in the record, before beginning her questioning the detective mischaracterized the gravity of the situation, and he asked to call his mother immediately after signing a form stating he was giving up his rights including
                        his right to have a parent present. State v. Saldierna, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 446, 803 S.E.2d 33 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Court of appeals erred in reversing an order denying defendant juvenile's motion to suppress because the trial court's findings of fact supported its conclusion that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his juvenile rights; a detective advised defendant
                        of his juvenile rights in English and Spanish, and he signed the juvenile rights waiver form, which indicated he decided to waive his rights and to speak with the detective without the presence of a parent, guardian, custodian,
                        or attorney. State v. Saldierna, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 407</cite>, 817 S.E.2d 174 (2018).

                        Warning Held Not Required. - Reasonable person in s juvenile defendant's position would not have believed himself to be in custody; thus, warnings under Miranda and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba21s7B-2101ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2101(a)</a></cite>                        were not required.

                        There was evidentiary support for a trial court's determination that defendant juvenile was not in custody and was not subjected to custodial interrogation when he made an inculpatory statement to police officers regarding shooting a gun at a neighbor's

                    A juvenile in custody for or charged with an offense which if committed by an adult would be a felony offense may request that nontestimonial identification procedures be conducted. If it appears that the results of specific nontestimonial identification

                        Doli Incapax Abolished. - Although the doctrine of doli incapax may still apply in other contexts, former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa49s7A-608" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-608</a></cite>, as amended
                        in 1994, expresses legislative intent to supersede the doctrine of doli incapax in the context of the transfer of a juvenile, between the ages of thirteen and fourteen, to superior court for trial. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite>                        269, 477 S.E.2d 182 (1996), cert. denied and appeal denied, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 644</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 714 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 588</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 819 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1111,
                        119 S. Ct. 883, 142 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Age Requirement Strictly Construed. - The court rejected the defendant's contention that the transfer statutes should be construed to prohibit transfer to superior court of a juvenile who is developmentally, socially, psychologically, and emotionally
                        younger than 13. In re Wright, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 527 S.E.2d 70 (2000).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Juvenile Rights. - When read in pari materia, former G.S. 7A-609, 7A-610, and former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa49s7A-608" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-608</a></cite> were intended by the legislature
                        to provide a juvenile the right to a hearing on the issue of whether his case should be transferred to the Superior Court for trial as an adult and the rights to be represented by counsel in accordance with former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa47s7A-584" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-584</a></cite>,
                        to testify as a witness in his own behalf, to call and examine witnesses, and to produce other evidence in his own behalf. State v. T.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 495 S.E.2d 700 (1998).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transfer of Case Is Within Discretion of Judge. - The decision on whether the case will be transferred to the superior court is left solely within the sound discretion of the district court judge who conducts the probable cause hearing. The exercise of
                        that discretion is not subject to review in the absence of a showing of gross abuse. In re Bunn, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 614, 239 S.E.2d 483 (1977).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No Right to Particular Trial Division. - Neither the juvenile defendant nor the State has the right to have a felony case disposed of in a particular trial division of the General Court of Justice. In re Bunn, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite>                        614, 239 S.E.2d 483 (1977).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Detailed Findings of Fact as to Probable Cause Not Required. - The North Carolina statutes relating to juveniles do not require that a determination of probable cause be supported by detailed findings of fact. In re Bullard,
                        <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 206 S.E.2d 305, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 758</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 279 (1974).

                    <p>
                        Findings of Fact Not Required for Transfer. - The judge is not required to make findings of fact to support his conclusion that the needs of the juvenile or the best interest of the State would be served by transferring the case to the superior court
                        division. It is only required that if he elects to order the transfer, he must state his reasons therefor. In re Bunn, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 614, 239 S.E.2d 483 (1977).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Birthday Rule. - The modern "birthday rule", under which a person attains a given age on the anniversary date of his or her birth is more reflective of common practice and understanding as to when a person reaches a given age. In re Robinson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 874, 464 S.E.2d 86 (1995).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fractions of days may not be considered in determining when a juvenile can be transferred to superior court for trial pursuant to this section. In re Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 874, 464 S.E.2d 86 (1995).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction Not Proper. - Because a district court never exercised jurisdiction over defendant for the charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, the superior court that convicted him never obtained jurisdiction via transfer of the charge; because
                        the trial court lacked jurisdiction over defendant for the conspiracy charge, his conviction was vacated. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 600 S.E.2d 16 (2004).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transfer Not Proper. - Where juvenile turned eighteen while a case against him was pending in the Court of Appeals, the district court's jurisdiction automatically terminated and the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, because the district
                        court did not properly transfer the case to its jurisdiction. State v. Dellinger, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 93</cite>, 468 S.E.2d 218 (1996).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transfer Proper. - Petition alleging that "juvenile was delinquent as defined by former G.S. 7A-517(12) [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba15s7B-1501" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1501</a></cite>] in that in Durham County and
                        on or about December 30, 1997, the above named juvenile unlawfully, willfully and feloniously did of malice aforethought kill and murder victim" properly alleged first degree murder under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa06s14-17" target="_blank">G.S. 14-17</a></cite>,
                        satisfied former G.S. 7A-560 [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba04s7B-402" target="_self">G.S. 7B-402</a></cite>] requirements, and made transfer of case to Superior Court mandatory under former G.S.7A-608 [see now this
                        section]. In re K.R.B., <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 328, 517 S.E.2d 200 (1999), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 188</cite>, 541 S.E.2d 713 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No Right to Appeal Transfer Decision Upon Guilty Plea. - Under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa91s15A-1444" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1444</a></cite>, defendant had no right to appeal a transfer
                        decision upon a plea of guilty because the appeal did not fall within any of the categories of appeal permitted under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa91s15A-1444" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1444</a></cite>;
                        moreover, defendant did not petition for a writ of certiorari and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba26s7B-2603ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2603(d)</a></cite> did not establish an exception to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa91s15A-1444ol1e" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1444(e)</a></cite>.
                        State v. Evans, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 736, 646 S.E.2d 859 (2007).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adult Convictions. - State court's records relating to defendant's 1995 convictions revealed that they were adult convictions; although a seventeen-year-old could be tried in North Carolina as either a juvenile or an adult,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba22s7B-2200" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2200</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba22s7B-2203" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2203</a></cite> ( North Carolina's district courts possessed exclusive,
                        original jurisdiction over any case involving a juvenile who was alleged to be delinquent, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba16s7B-1601" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1601</a></cite>, thus, if defendant was tried and convicted as a juvenile,
                        he could have been prosecuted only in a North Carolina district court. The judgments underlying defendant's 1995 convictions, however, demonstrated that he was convicted and sentenced in the Superior Court of Surry County, North
                        Carolina, and his 1995 Convictions were therefore necessarily adult convictions. United States v. Allen, 446 F.3d 522 (4th Cir. 2006).

                    <p>
                        Purpose. - A probable cause hearing is not conducted for the purposes of discovery; its purpose is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the juvenile respondent committed it. A further purpose
                        of the probable cause hearing prescribed by former G.S. 7A-609 is to determine whether the juvenile's case should be transferred to superior court for trial as an adult. In re Bass, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                        110, 334 S.E.2d 779 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Legislative Intent. - The legislature intended that rights accorded a juvenile by former G.S. 7A-609 also should be accorded a juvenile with regard to the District Court's consideration and decision as whether to transfer jurisdiction over the juvenile
                        to Superior Court for trial as an adult. State v. T.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 495 S.E.2d 700 (1998).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Subsection (a) of former G.S. 7A-609 requires that a probable cause hearing be conducted in all cases in which a minor 14 years of age or older is charged with a felony before the court may transfer the case to the superior court for trial or proceed
                        with an adjudicatory hearing in the district court. In re Bass, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 334 S.E.2d 779 (1985).

                        Trial Court May Conduct Probable Cause, Transfer, and Adjudicatory Hearings In One Proceeding. - Nothing in

                        cause, transfer, and adjudicatory hearings because the plain language of the statutes provides that the trial court "shall either proceed" from one hearing to the next or set a date for that hearing; thus, the trial court may conduct
                        all three hearings in one proceeding, so long as the juvenile's requisite statutory and constitutional rights are safeguarded. In re J.J., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 717 S.E.2d 59 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Burden on Juvenile. - The burden is upon juvenile to show a reasonable possibility that a different result would have been reached at his adjudicatory hearing had he been afforded a probable cause hearing. In re Bass, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                        110, 334 S.E.2d 779 (1985).

                        Constitutionality. - Defendants contention that former G.S. 7A-610 (see now this section) failed to guarantee due process because it was vague and overbroad was without merit. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite>                        269, 477 S.E.2d 182 (1996), cert. denied and appeal denied, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 644</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 714 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 588</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 819 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1111,

                        This section is not void for vagueness since it puts a person of ordinary intelligence on notice that 13-year-old offenders will either have their cases transferred to superior court or are in jeopardy of having their cases transferred if the juvenile
                        court deems it warranted, and it also provides the juvenile court judge with sufficient guidance and criteria to make discretionary transfer rulings. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 588</cite>,

                        Purpose. - A probable cause hearing is not conducted for the purposes of discovery; its purpose is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the juvenile respondent committed it. A further purpose
                        of the probable cause hearing prescribed by former G.S. 7A-610 (see now this section) is to determine whether the juvenile's case should be transferred to superior court for trial as an adult. In re Bass,

                    <p>
                        Legislative Intent. - The legislature intended that rights accorded a juvenile by former G.S. 7A-610 (see now this section) also should be accorded a juvenile with regard to the District Court's consideration and decision as whether to transfer jurisdiction
                        over the juvenile to Superior Court for trial as an adult. State v. T.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 495 S.E.2d 700 (1998).

                        or set a date for that hearing; thus, the trial court may conduct all three hearings in one proceeding, so long as the juvenile's requisite statutory and constitutional rights are safeguarded.

                        Transfer of Case Was Abuse of Discretion. - Superior court erred in finding that a district court abused the court's discretion in transferring a juvenile's case to the superior court because the superior court failed to properly apply the abuse of discretion

                        the superior court chose to give more weight than the district court did to the expert testimony addressing the facilities and programs available in the juvenile system and the likelihood that the juvenile would benefit from such
                        treatment, but the district court found other factors to be more compelling and entitled to greater weight, including the juvenile's age, his average to above average cognitive abilities, the aggressive, violent, premeditated,
                        and willful manner in which the alleged crimes were committed, and the seriousness of the crimes. In re E.S., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 568, 663 S.E.2d 475 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 681</cite>,

                        No Right to Particular Trial Division. - Neither the juvenile defendant nor the State has the right to have a felony case disposed of in a particular trial division of the General Court of Justice. In re Bunn, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite>                        614, 239 S.E.2d 483 (1977), decided under former G.S. 7A-280.

                    <p>
                        The decision to transfer a juvenile's case to superior court lies solely within the sound discretion of the district court judge and is not subject to review absent a showing of gross abuse of discretion. State v. Green,
                        <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 269, 477 S.E.2d 182 (1996), cert. denied and appeal denied, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 644</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 714 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 588</cite>, 502 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Transfer Within Statutory Guidelines. - Juvenile court judge acted within statutory guidelines in transferring a 13-year-old defendant to superior court to stand trial on charges of first-degree sexual offense, attempted first-degree rape, and first-degree
                        burglary, where the judge considered the seriousness of the offenses, the fact that the victim was a stranger to the juvenile, the community's need to be aware of and protected from such serious crimes, defendant's history of assaultive
                        behavior, his acknowledgment of difficulty in controlling his temper, and the strong evidence of his guilt, considering his confession. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 588</cite>, 502 S.E.2d
                        819 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1111, 119 S. Ct. 883, 142 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Evidence Supported Transfer. - The trial court's order transferring first degree sex offense charges against 13-year-old to the Superior Court was supported by sufficient evidence and findings; and due consideration of juvenile's age, maturity, condition
                        or needs for treatment was given although not required. In re Wright, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 527 S.E.2d 70 (2000).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The juvenile court abused its discretion in transferring felony charges to superior court under former G.S. 7A-610 where the transfer order was deficient because it failed to adequately state reasons for the transfer, as required by the section and State
                        v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 588</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 819 (1998); nor did it reflect that consideration was given to the needs of the juvenile, to his rehabilitative potential, and to the family
                        support he received. In re J.L.W., <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 596, 525 S.E.2d 500 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Adult Convictions. - State court's records relating to defendant's 1995 convictions revealed that they were adult convictions; although a seventeen-year-old could be tried in North Carolina as either a juvenile or an adult,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba22s7B-2200" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2200</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba22s7B-2203" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2203</a></cite>, North Carolina's district courts possessed exclusive,
                        original jurisdiction over any case involving a juvenile who was alleged to be delinquent, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba16s7B-1601" target="_self">G.S. 7B-1601</a></cite>, thus, if defendant was tried and convicted as a juvenile,
                        he could have been prosecuted only in a North Carolina district court. The judgments underlying defendant's 1995 convictions, however, demonstrated that he was convicted and sentenced in the Superior Court of Surry County, North
                        Carolina, and his 1995 Convictions were therefore necessarily adult convictions. United States v. Allen, 446 F.3d 522 (4th Cir. 2006).

                <p>
                    At any hearing authorized or required by this Subchapter, the judge may subject a juvenile to physical restraint in the courtroom only when the judge finds the restraint to be reasonably necessary to maintain order, prevent the juvenile's escape, or provide
                    for the safety of the courtroom. Whenever practical, the judge shall provide the juvenile and the juvenile's attorney an opportunity to be heard to contest the use of restraints before the judge orders the use of restraints. If restraints
                    are ordered, the judge shall make findings of fact in support of the order.

                            Juvenile Proceedings Are Designed to Foster Individualized Disposition. - Juvenile proceedings are something less than a full blown determination of criminality. They are designed to foster individualized disposition of juvenile offenders under protection
                            of the courts in accordance with constitutional safeguards. In re Arthur, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 218 S.E.2d 869 (1975), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 640</cite>,

                            Juvenile proceedings are not criminal prosecutions. Nor is a finding of delinquency in a juvenile proceeding synonymous with conviction of a crime. In re Burrus, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879 (1969),
                            aff'd sub nom., McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971); In re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 437, 181 S.E.2d 162, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 616</cite>,

                            But Such Proceedings Are Criminal for Purposes of U.S. Const., Amend. V. - Juvenile proceedings must be regarded as "criminal" for purposes of U.S. Const., Amend. V, the privilege against self-incrimination. State v. Rush,
                            <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 186 S.E.2d 595 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Juvenile delinquency hearings place juveniles in danger of confinement, and, therefore, the proceedings are to be treated as criminal proceedings, and conducted with due process in accord with constitutional safeguards of U.S. Const., Amend. V. In re
                            Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 230 S.E.2d 198 (1976), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 711</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 203 (1977).

                            And Double Jeopardy Rule Applies. - Although distinctions between juvenile proceedings and criminal prosecutions still exist, they are sufficiently similar in nature that the double jeopardy provisions of the United States and North Carolina Constitutions
                            are applicable to them. Accordingly, jeopardy attaches to the initial petition once an adjudicatory hearing on the merits is held. In re Drakeford, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 113,
                            230 S.E.2d 779 (1977).

                            in the juvenile petition, he was represented by counsel throughout both hearings, and he was present, put forth evidence on his behalf, and cross-examined the State's witnesses; defendant failed to show how he was prejudiced
                            by the trial court's decision to conduct the adjudicatory hearing before adjudicating him a delinquent juvenile. In re J.J., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 717 S.E.2d 59 (2011).

                            Duty of District Court. - It is the constant duty of the district court to give each child subject to its jurisdiction such oversight and control as will be conducive to the welfare of the child and to the best interest of the State, and to ensure that
                            the juvenile be carefully afforded all constitutional safeguards at every stage of the hearings. In re Eldridge, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 723, 177 S.E.2d 313 (1970).

                            Standards for Evaluation of Evidence. - The North Carolina Juvenile Code gives defendants in juvenile adjudication hearings, with certain exceptions, all rights afforded adult offenders, and thus the juvenile respondents are entitled to have the evidence
                            presented in their adjudicatory hearing evaluated by the same standards as apply in criminal proceedings against adults. In re Meaut, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 153, 275 S.E.2d 200
                            (1981).

                            A juvenile respondent is entitled to have evidence evaluated by the same standards as apply in criminal proceedings against adults. In re Dulaney, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 587, 328 S.E.2d 904 (1985); In re
                            Howett, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 331 S.E.2d 701 (1985); In re Bass, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 334 S.E.2d 779 (1985).

                            When a parent is absent from a termination proceeding and the trial court preserves the adversarial nature of the proceeding by allowing the parent's counsel to cross examine witnesses, with the questions and answers being recorded, the parent must demonstrate
                            some actual prejudice in order to prevail upon appeal. In re Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 414 S.E.2d 396, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 663</cite>, 422 S.E.2d 577

                            In order to withstand a motion to dismiss the charges contained in a juvenile petition, there must be substantial evidence of each of the material elements of the offense charged; the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the state,
                            and the state is entitled to every reasonable inference of fact which may be drawn from the evidence. In re Bass, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 334 S.E.2d 779 (1985).

                            Restitution Order Held Unauthorized. - Where juvenile was not petitioned or adjudicated for the delinquent act of damaging the personal property of a certain victim, the court was without authority to order him to pay any restitution to her. In re Hull,

                            Requirements of Due Process. - So long as proceedings in the juvenile court meet the requirements of due process, they are constitutionally sound and must be upheld. This means that: (1) The basic requirements of due process and fairness must be satisfied
                            in a juvenile court adjudication of delinquency. (2) U.S. Const., Amend. XIV applies to prohibit the use of a coerced confession of a juvenile. (3) Notice must be given in juvenile proceedings which would be deemed constitutionally
                            adequate in a civil or criminal proceeding; that is, notice must be given the juvenile and his parents sufficiently in advance of scheduled court proceedings to afford them reasonable opportunity to prepare, and the notice
                            must set forth the alleged misconduct with particularity. (4) In juvenile proceedings to determine delinquency which may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile's freedom is curtailed, the child and his
                            parents must be notified of the child's right to counsel and, if unable to afford counsel, to the appointment of same. (5) Juvenile proceedings to determine delinquency, as a result of which the juvenile may be committed to
                            a State institution, must be regarded as "criminal" for purposes of U.S. Const., Amend. V, the privilege against self-incrimination. The privilege applies in juvenile proceedings the same as in adult criminal cases. In re Burrus,
                            <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879 (1969), aff'd sub nom. McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971).

                            Due process for a juvenile includes written notice of specific charges in advance of hearing; notification to child and parent of the right to counsel and that, if necessary, counsel will be appointed; the privilege against self-incrimination; proof of
                            the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt; and determination of delinquency based on sworn testimony subject to cross-examination in the absence of a valid confession.

                            Privilege Against Self-Incrimination - Juvenile who was adjudicated to be a delinquent because of his sexual assault of another child could not be required, as a condition of his probation, to admit to the underlying offense, for purposes of treatment,
                            without being granted use immunity or some other protection from the use of such an admission against him because the privilege against self-incrimination applied to juveniles, under subdivision (4) of this section. In re Butts,

                            Trial court failed to advise defendant juvenile of his right against self-incrimination before he testified and incriminated himself, and the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Directly asking whether defendant understood his rights after
                            he testified given was not sufficient to satisfy the requirements under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2405" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2405</a></cite>.

                            Juvenile Admission. - Although a trial court did not strictly comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Xa58s15A-1022ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1022(d)</a></cite>, a juvenile had been informed
                            of the consequences of his Alford admission and understood what would happen if he persisted in making such an admission because the juvenile: (1) acknowledged during his colloquy that he was admitting responsibility for committing
                            misdemeanor possession of stolen goods; (2) acknowledged he had been informed of the most severe consequences that could result from making the admission; (3) indicated he understood the charge and had discussed available defenses
                            with his attorney; and (4) stated he understood he could deny the allegations and have a hearing and that, by admitting responsibility, he was foregoing that right. In re C.L., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 109,

                            Counsel Is Required in Delinquency Proceedings. - The due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV requires that in respect of proceedings to determine delinquency which may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile's freedom is curtailed,
                            the child and his parents must be notified of the child's right to be represented by counsel retained by them, or if they are unable to afford counsel, that counsel will be appointed to represent the child. In re Garcia,

                            equal protection of the laws to the undisciplined child. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 28</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 702 (1972).

         Trial by jury in the juvenile court's adjudicative stage is not a constitutional requirement.

                            Absent a statute providing for a jury trial, it is almost universally held that in juvenile court delinquency proceedings the alleged delinquent has no right under the pertinent state or federal Constitution to demand that the issue of his delinquency
                            be determined by a jury. In re Burrus, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879 (1969), aff'd sub nom. McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971).

                            Dual Role as Judge and Prosecutor Is Unconstitutional. - Due process rights of a juvenile were violated where the trial judge examined the witnesses for the State because of the absence of the district attorney or other counsel to represent the State.
                            In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 525, 263 S.E.2d 355 (1980).

                            The presiding judge in a juvenile proceeding that could lead to detention should not assume the role of prosecuting attorney where the juvenile is represented by counsel and the hearing is adversary in nature. Such procedure would clearly violate due
                            process in adult criminal prosecutions, nor would a dual role of judge and prosecutor measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment in juvenile proceedings where detention could result. In re Thomas,

                            Limitation on Right to Confront Witness. - Although former G.S. 7A-631 guaranteed respondent the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the right to confront witnesses in civil cases is subject to "due limitations." In re Barkley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 267, 300 S.E.2d 713 (1983).

                            Where excluded party's presence during testimony might intimidate witness and influence his answers, due to that party's position of authority over the testifying witness, any right under this Article to confront the witnesses is properly limited. In

                        arose during the juvenile's adjudication hearing as he was seen by a court counselor mouthing the words "I'm going to kick your ass" to a witness who had just testified against him, therefore, the State was entitled to more time

                        Acceptance of Admission. - In a juvenile hearing to determine delinquency, which may lead to commitment to a State institution, an admission by the juvenile of the allegations of the petition must be made with awareness of the consequences of the admission
                        and must be made understandingly and voluntarily, and these facts must affirmatively appear in the record of the proceeding. In re Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 230 S.E.2d 198 (1976),
                        cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 711</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 203 (1977); In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 232 S.E.2d 486 (1977).

                    <p>
                        Applicability. - Where a juvenile's court supervision was revoked for probation violations, it was not error to fail to make the specific inquiries enumerated in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407</a></cite>                        because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407</a></cite> did not apply to the juvenile's admission, or admissions by the juvenile through the juvenile's attorney, that the juvenile violated conditions
                        of court supervision. In re D.J.M., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 126, 638 S.E.2d 610 (2007).

        Colloquy Requirements.
       </b> - Statute does not require the exact statutory language to be used during the colloquy, but rather requires the court to orally and clearly inform the juvenile of his rights right. In re W.M.C.M., - N.C. App. - , -

                    <p>
                        Explanation of Confrontation Rights. - Trial court gave a broader explanation to the juvenile of his confrontation rights than the exact statutory language in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407(a)(4)</a></cite>                        and followed the transcript of admission form almost verbatim; the juvenile understood that he could deny the allegations and have a hearing and that, by admitting responsibility, he was foregoing that right.

                    <p>
                        Court which initially adjudged the juvenile to be delinquent erred in accepting the juvenile's admission. In re Kenyon N., <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 429 S.E.2d 447 (1993).

                    <p>
                        An admission by the juvenile to the allegations of the petition is equivalent to a plea of guilty by an adult in a criminal prosecution. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 232 S.E.2d 486 (1977).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Court to Make Individual Inquiries. - It is the duty of the trial judge in carrying out the requirements of this section to give each child individual attention, as it is impossible for the judge to determine that the admission is a product of informed
                        choice without making the required inquiries of each child individually. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 352 S.E.2d 889 (1987).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Acceptance of Admission Was Erroneous. - In a juvenile proceedings, the trial court erred in accepting defendant's admission because the trial court failed to inquire whether defendant was satisfied with his representation, as required by
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407(a)</a></cite>, and the error was not harmless. In re T.E.F., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 604 S.E.2d 348 (2004), aff'd, - N.C. - , 614
                        S.E.2d 296 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Addressing each of the six issues listed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407(a)</a></cite> is mandatory and a "totality of the circumstances" standard of review is inapplicable; thus,
                        a trial court committed reversible error in taking an admission from a juvenile in an adjudicatory hearing without specifically asking the juvenile if he was satisfied with his counsel as was required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407(a)</a></cite>.
                        In re T.E.F., <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 570</cite>, 614 S.E.2d 296 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's adjudication and disposition orders were reversed where there was no indication that it had informed a juvenile of his right to remain silent and the risk that any statements may be used against him or of his right to deny the allegations
                        and as a result, it had failed to cover all of the six steps listed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407(a)</a></cite>. In re A.W., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                        159, 641 S.E.2d 354 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the State failed to provide information in compliance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407</a></cite> to establish a factual basis for admitting defendant, a juvenile's, plea, as the
                        prosecutor's statement of facts did not contain any statement or evidence that the pickup truck was worth more than $1,000, and the record included no written statement of defendant or sworn testimony or a statement of facts by
                        his attorney that indicated that the truck was valued at more than $1,000, defendant's admission of guilt as to the stolen vehicle had to be vacated. In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 662 S.E.2d 570 (2008).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Custodial Term Greater in Disposition Than That in Admission Transcript. - Trial court erred in not advising appellant, a juvenile, of the correct maximum custodial confinement and in entering an order where the maximum custodial confinement was greater
                        than that allowed for in the admission transcript; appellant had agreed to a disposition confining him to a maximum term of his 19th birthday, not his 21st birthday. In re D.A.F., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite>                        832, 635 S.E.2d 509 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Testimony as to Juvenile's Statements Properly Admitted. - Officer's testimony about juvenile defendant's statements was properly admitted under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 801(d); the officer interviewed defendant with his mother present, defendant was not in custody, and the
                        juvenile rights warning was read to defendant and his mother, who both signed a statement indicating they understood the rights. In re J.J.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 777, 659 S.E.2d 757 (2008).

        Plea Knowingly Entered.
       </b> - Record affirmatively showed on its face defendant juvenile's plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered; the trial court not only addressed all six prongs in the statute, but broke down the language for the juvenile
                        to better comprehend and respond affirmatively to the questions. The juvenile was fully informed of the rights he waived and he signed the form agreement after the trial court had explained his rights to him while represented by

                        Psychological Reports. - The clear intent of the legislature is that a hearing upon a motion for review is in the nature of a dispositional hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing, and that the formal rules of evidence,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, do not apply. Therefore, the trial court could properly consider written psychological reports in determining, on motion brought
                        by parents whose parental rights had been terminated under former G.S. 7A-289.34, whether the needs of children would be best served by modification of its previous orders concerning visitation.

                        The proper quantum of proof in a juvenile hearing to determine delinquency is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 232 S.E.2d 486 (1977), decided under former G.S. 7A-285.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a juvenile adjudicatory hearing, the respondent is entitled to have the evidence evaluated by the same standards as apply in criminal proceedings against adults. The State, therefore, must present substantial evidence of each essential element of the
                        offense charged and of respondent's being the perpetrator. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 348 S.E.2d 823 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adjudication order contained an ambiguity that could not be resolved as to the standard of proof used for purposes of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2409" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2409</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2411" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2411</a></cite>                        because in its findings after a juvenile delinquency adjudication hearing, the trial court correctly stated the burden of proof as proof proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but in the portion of the order that referenced an assault
                        inflicting serious injury, a clear, cogent and convincing evidence burden of proof was stated. In re C.B., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 803, 654 S.E.2d 21 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in failing to adjudicate a juvenile delinquent based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt because the adjudication order stated that the facts were proven beyond a reasonable doubt; although the trial court ultimately determines
                        the existence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a respondent's guilt, in considering a motion to dismiss, the evidence is examined in the light most favorable to the State. In re S.M., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite>                        579, 660 S.E.2d 653 (2008).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statutory use of "shall" is a mandate to trial judges requiring them to affirmatively state that the allegations of the juvenile petition are proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Failure to follow the mandate of the statute is error. In re Wade,
                        <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 313 S.E.2d 862 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is reversible error for a trial court to fail to state affirmatively that an adjudication of delinquency is based upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 348 S.E.2d 823
                        (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The order of the trial judge must affirmatively state that the allegations are proved beyond a reasonable doubt, even in cases where the juvenile admits the offense alleged. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite>                        336, 352 S.E.2d 889 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statutory use of the word "shall" mandates trial judges to affirmatively state that the reasonable doubt standard was followed. Failure of the trial judge to follow the clear mandate of the statute is error. In re Mitchell,
                        <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 164, 359 S.E.2d 809 (1987).

                    <p>
                        The trial court is required to make ultimate findings of fact based on the evidence and to enter clear and specific conclusions of law based on the findings of fact. In re Gleisner, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 475,
                        539 S.E.2d 362 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Trial Court Must Unequivocally State Standard of Proof Used in Adjudication Order. - Case was remanded for clarification of the standard of proof used in the order adjudicating a juvenile defendant delinquent for committing indecent liberties between
                        children, in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa26s14-202.2" target="_blank">G.S. 14-202.2</a></cite>, because the trial court did not unequivocally state that it
                        found the facts underlying the adjudication order to be true beyond a reasonable doubt, as required under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2411" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2411</a></cite>. In re B.E., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite>                        656, 652 S.E.2d 344 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Oral Finding Sufficient - Where the trial court, in juvenile proceedings, orally made its <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2409" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2409</a></cite> finding that defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt, engaged
                        in the acts alleged, but the trial court did not include this finding in the written adjudication order, the oral finding was sufficient to satisfy the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2411" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2411</a></cite>                        requirement that the finding be stated; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2512" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2512</a></cite> required the findings in the dispositional order, but not the adjudicatory order, to be in writing. In
                        re Rikard, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 587 S.E.2d 467 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Binding Effect of Order Failing to State Standard of Proof When Not Appealed. - A trial court's failure to state the standard of proof used in making a determination of abuse or neglect constitutes error. However, because no appeal was taken or other
                        relief sought from trial court's failure to state the standard of proof used in an order adjudging respondent's children abused and neglected, it remained a valid final order which was binding in a later proceeding on the facts.
                        In re Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 189, 360 S.E.2d 458 (1987).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Estoppel to Relitigate Issue Decided in Previous Proceeding. - The trial court did not err by concluding that petitioner was authorized to file petition to terminate parental rights, nor by ruling that the parties were estopped from relitigating abuse
                        and neglect issues decided in previous proceeding in which respondent was found to have sexually abused his children, where the trial court did not rely solely upon the previous order in a way that would have impermissibly predetermined
                        the outcome of the termination hearing, and did not deny respondent the opportunity to present evidence relevant to these issues, but merely prohibited the parties from relitigating whether respondent had, in fact, sexually abused
                        his children. In re Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 189, 360 S.E.2d 458 (1987).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court met the requirements of former G.S.7A-635 (see now this section) and former G.S. 7A-637 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-807" target="_self">G.S. 7B-807</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2410" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2410</a></cite>)
                        by stating the standard used at the adjudication stage of the proceeding; he was not also required to recite that his decision at the disposition stage of the proceeding was discretionary. Clark v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite>                        668, 373 S.E.2d 317 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The evidence before the trial court was sufficient to support its findings of abuse and neglect where: (1) Child, while in respondent's sole care, suffered multiple burns over a wide portion of her body; (2) no accidental cause was established, and the
                        child in fact stated that respondent burned her; (3) the burns were serious, requiring prompt medical attention; (4) respondent did not seek treatment for the child's injuries and refused to permit social worker to do so; and (5)
                        the child was taken for treatment only upon the intervention of the sheriff's department, over respondent's opposition. In re Hayden, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 384 S.E.2d 558 (1989).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A finding of neglect by clear and convincing evidence was proper where the children were kept at home, and they did not receive proper medical care, supervision, or adequate nutrition. In re Bell, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite>                        566, 421 S.E.2d 590, appeal withdrawn, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 168</cite>, 426 S.E.2d 699 (1992).

                    <p>
                        Juvenile Admission. - Where a juvenile's court supervision was revoked for probation violations, it was not error to fail to make the specific inquiries enumerated in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407</a></cite>,
                        because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407</a></cite> did not apply to the juvenile's admission, or admissions by the juvenile through the juvenile's attorney, that the juvenile violated conditions
                        of court supervision. In re D.J.M., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 126, 638 S.E.2d 610 (2007).

                        The statutory use of "shall" is a mandate to trial judges requiring them to affirmatively state that the allegations of the juvenile petition are proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Failure to follow the mandate of the statute is error. In re Wade,
                        <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 313 S.E.2d 862 (1984).

                    <p>
                        If the judge finds that the allegations in the petition have been proved, as provided in G.S. 7A-635 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-805" target="_self">G.S. 7B-805</a></cite> and 7B-2409), i.e., beyond a reasonable
                        doubt, he shall so state. The failure of the trial judge to follow the clear mandate of the statute is error. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 331 S.E.2d 756 (1985).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is reversible error for a trial court to fail to state affirmatively that an adjudication of delinquency is based upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 348 S.E.2d 823
                        (1986).

                    <p>
                        The order of the trial judge must affirmatively state that the allegations are proved beyond a reasonable doubt, even in cases where the juvenile admits the offense alleged. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite>                        336, 352 S.E.2d 889 (1987).

                    <p>
                        The statutory use of the word "shall" mandates trial judges to affirmatively state that the reasonable doubt standard was followed. Failure of the trial judge to follow the clear mandate of the statute is error. In re Mitchell,
                        <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 164, 359 S.E.2d 809 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Oral Finding Sufficient - Where the trial court, in juvenile proceedings, orally made its <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2409" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2409</a></cite> finding that defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt, engaged
                        in the acts alleged, but the trial court did not include this finding in the written adjudication order, the oral finding was sufficient to satisfy the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2411" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2411</a></cite>                        requirement that the finding be stated; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2512" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2512</a></cite> required the findings in the dispositional order, but not the adjudicatory order, to be in writing. In
                        re Rikard, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 587 S.E.2d 467 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given the trial court's findings that were attached to the adjudication and the conclusion that defendant juvenile was delinquent, the court rejected the defendant's argument that the trial court failed to find that the defendant committed a misdemeanor
                        beyond a reasonable doubt. In re M.J.G., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 759 S.E.2d 361 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Insufficient Findings. - Trial court erred by failing to include the requisite findings in its juvenile delinquency adjudication order because the adjudication order failed to address any of the allegations as required by
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2411" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2411</a></cite>, and did not even summarily aver that the allegations in the petition had been proved, which was a minimum requirement. In re J.V.J., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite>                        737, 707 S.E.2d 636 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Correction of Written Order Necessary - In a juvenile delinquency proceeding, a trial court's oral findings as to whether the State had proved the allegations against a juvenile sufficed; however, the written order had to be corrected so that the record
                        reflected the finding. In re Rikard, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 587 S.E.2d 467 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the trial court made a clerical error by failing to mark the appropriate box in the conclusion of law section of the pre-printed form portion of the order to designate the offense as violent, serious, or minor, the matter was remanded for correction
                        of the error; the trial court properly designated the offense as a Class 2 misdemeanor but simply neglected to mark the appropriate box to again identify the offense in the conclusion of law section. In re I.W.P.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 815 S.E.2d 696 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Binding Effect of Order Failing to State Standard of Proof When Not Appealed. - A trial court's failure to state the standard of proof used in making a determination of abuse or neglect constitutes error. However, because no appeal was taken or other
                        relief sought from trial court's failure to state the standard of proof used in an order adjudging respondent's children abused and neglected, it remained a valid final order which was binding in a later proceeding on the facts.
                        In re Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 189, 360 S.E.2d 458 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Estoppel to Relitigate Issue Decided in Previous Proceeding. - The trial court did not err by concluding that petitioner was authorized to file petition to terminate parental rights, nor by ruling that the parties were estopped from relitigating abuse
                        and neglect issues decided in previous proceeding in which respondent was found to have sexually abused his children, where the trial court did not rely solely upon the previous order in a way that would have impermissibly predetermined
                        the outcome of the termination hearing, and did not deny respondent the opportunity to present evidence relevant to these issues, but merely prohibited the parties from relitigating whether respondent had, in fact, sexually abused
                        his children. In re Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 189, 360 S.E.2d 458 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Trial court met the requirements of this section by stating the standard used at the adjudication stage of the proceeding; he was not also required to recite that his decision at the disposition stage of the proceeding was discretionary. Clark v. Williamson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 373 S.E.2d 317 (1988).

                        Trial Court Must Unequivocally State Standard of Proof Used in Adjudication Order. - Case was remanded for clarification of the standard of proof used in the order adjudicating a juvenile defendant delinquent for committing indecent liberties between
                        children, in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa26s14-202.2" target="_blank">G.S. 14-202.2</a></cite>, because the trial court did not unequivocally state that it
                        found the facts underlying the adjudication order to be true beyond a reasonable doubt, as required under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2411" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2411</a></cite>. In re B.E., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite>                        656, 652 S.E.2d 344 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Standard of Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt. - Trial court did not err in failing to adjudicate a juvenile delinquent based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt because the adjudication order stated that the facts were proven beyond a reasonable doubt;
                        although the trial court ultimately determines the existence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a respondent's guilt, in considering a motion to dismiss, the evidence is examined in the light most favorable to the State. In
                        re S.M., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 660 S.E.2d 653 (2008).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ambiguity as to Burden of Proof. - Adjudication order contained an ambiguity that could not be resolved as to the standard of proof used for purposes of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2409" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2409</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2411" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2411</a></cite> because in its findings after a juvenile delinquency adjudication hearing, the trial court correctly stated the burden of proof as proof proven
                        beyond a reasonable doubt, but in the portion of the order that referenced an assault inflicting serious injury, a clear, cogent and convincing evidence burden of proof was stated. In re C.B., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite>                        803, 654 S.E.2d 21 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Self-Defense Not Grounds for Dismissal. - Trial court did not err in failing to dismiss a juvenile adjudication petition because the juvenile's claim of self-defense was not cause to dismiss the proceeding. In re Wilson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 196, 568 S.E.2d 862 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Failure To Include Findings Of Fact In Written Adjudication. - Trial court's delinquent adjudication was vacated because the trial court erred by failing to include the requisite findings of fact in its written adjudication order pursuant to
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2411" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2411</a></cite>; the trial court is required to include the standard of proof in its written adjudication order pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2411" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2411</a></cite>.
                        In re J.J., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 717 S.E.2d 59 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Minimum Requirements of Adjudication Satisfied. - Defendant juvenile's adjudication of delinquency for simple assault satisfied the minimum requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2411" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2411</a></cite>                        because it provided the date of the offense, the fact that the assault was a class 2 misdemeanor, the date of the adjudication, and clearly stated that the court considered the evidence and adjudicated defendant delinquent as to
                        the petition's allegation of simple assault beyond a reasonable doubt. In re K.C., <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 452, 742 S.E.2d 239 (2013), review denied, 747 S.E.2d 530, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 786 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a juvenile case, a trial court made findings of fact that complied with this statute where it found that the allegations had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and stated so in its written adjudication order. The trial court found that it was proved
                        beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about the date of October 16, 2013, respondent, a juvenile, did unlawfully and willfully steal, take, and carry away a cellphone with a pink and gray otter box case, the personal property of
                        the victim having a value of $300.00. In re K.M.M., <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 774 S.E.2d 430 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's adjudication order satisfied the statute because disorderly conduct was identified as the type of offense, and the date of the offense and the date the petition was filed were listed; the adjudication order contained delinquency hearing
                        as the type of proceeding, the trial judge's signature, and date and proof of filing, and it also included a description of defendant juvenile's specific conduct and made the subsequent conclusion of law indicating delinquency.

                    and the court makes a written finding that a report is not needed, the court may proceed with the dispositional hearing. No predisposition report or risk and needs assessment of any child alleged to be delinquent or undisciplined shall
                    be made prior to an adjudication that the juvenile is within the juvenile jurisdiction of the court unless the juvenile, the juvenile's parent, guardian, or custodian, or the juvenile's attorney files a written statement with the juvenile

                    at the dispositional hearing. The court may order counsel not to disclose parts of the report to the juvenile or the juvenile's parent, guardian, or custodian if the court finds that disclosure would seriously harm the treatment or
                    rehabilitation of the juvenile or would violate a promise of confidentiality given to a source of information.

                        arose during the juvenile's adjudication hearing as he was seen by a court counselor mouthing the words "I'm going to kick your ass" to a witness who had just testified against him; therefore, the State was entitled to more time

                        Continuance For the State. - Trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering a juvenile into custody and continuing his disposition hearing with regard to charges of breaking and entering, trespass, and injury to real property, because a fourth charge
                        arose during the juvenile's adjudication hearing as he was seen by a court counselor mouthing the words "I'm going to kick your ass" to a witness who had just testified against him, therefore, the State was entitled to more time
                        to prepare since the fourth charge of intimidating a witness was added. In re R.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 623 S.E.2d 341 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 219</cite>,

                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Purpose of Juvenile Code. - The stated purpose of the North Carolina Juvenile Code is to avoid commitment of the juvenile to training school (now youth development center) if he could be helped through community-level resources. In re Hughes,
                        <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 273 S.E.2d 324 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Discretion of Court. - It was the legislature's intention that the district courts exercise sound discretion in fashioning an appropriate response to each particular instance of delinquency. In re Brownlee, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 532</cite>,
                        272 S.E.2d 861 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Duty of District Court. - It is the constant duty of the district court to give each child subject to its jurisdiction such oversight and control as will conduce to the welfare of the child and to the best interest of the State, and to ensure that the
                        juvenile be carefully afforded all constitutional safeguards at every stage of the hearings. In re Eldridge, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 723, 177 S.E.2d 313 (1970).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The court is required to consider the welfare of the delinquent child as well as the best interest of the State. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 251 S.E.2d 643 (1979).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What Judge Must Determine. - This section necessarily requires the judge to first determine the needs of the juvenile and then to determine the appropriate community resources required to meet those needs in order to strengthen the home situation of the
                        juvenile. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Juvenile's dispositional order did not err for not considering statutory factors because (1) <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2512" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2512</a></cite> did not require findings on those factors, and (2)
                        the court considered the factors, as finding a robbery with a dangerous weapon adjudication showed the crime's seriousness was considered, findings of repeated probation violations showed a need to hold the juvenile accountable
                        was considered, findings of the juvenile's adjudication for armed robbery and school suspension for fighting showed public protection was considered, findings of how the juvenile violated probation showed degree of culpability
                        was considered, and finding the juvenile's failure to obtain treatment showed treatment needs were considered. In re D.E.P., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 752, 796 S.E.2d 509 (2017).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Determination of Child's Interest. - What is or is not in the best interest of the child must be determined in tandem with the perception of the legislature as to what is in the best interest of the state as enunciated by the terms of the Juvenile Code
                        and by its general theme as deduced from the impetus behind its enactment. In re Brownlee, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 532</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 861 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Least Restrictive Disposition Must Be Selected. - In selecting among dispositional alternatives, the trial judge is required to select the least restrictive disposition, taking into account the seriousness of the offense, degree of culpability, age, prior
                        record, and circumstances of the particular case. The judge must also weigh the State's best interest and select a disposition consistent with public safety, and within the judge's statutorily granted authority. In re Bullabough,
                        <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

                        District Court Not Authorized to Require Creation of Foster Home. - The district court is not authorized to require a county Department of Social Services, either by itself or in conjunction with another agency, to implement the creation of a foster home
                        with appropriate staff, wherein juveniles might be permanently domiciled for program treatment and delivery of services. In re Wharton, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 565</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 688 (1982).

                        Identical Judgments Erroneous for Varying Offenses and Culpability. - The juvenile court failed to consider the express purposes of the Juvenile Code where it entered identical judgments in all six cases tried together, and in which the juveniles ranged
                        in age from 6 to 14, were found to have committed and admitted committing different offenses, and had varying degrees of culpability. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 352 S.E.2d

                        What Evidence Must Be Considered. - Whenever the trial court is determining the best interest of a child, any evidence which is competent and relevant to a showing of the best interest of that child must be heard and considered by the trial court, subject
                        to the discretionary powers of the trial court to exclude cumulative testimony. Without hearing and considering such evidence, the trial court cannot make an informed and intelligent decision concerning the best interest of the
                        child. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 567 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At a dispositional hearing the trial judge is not restricted to consideration of only those acts for which there had been an adjudication. If the information presented is determined by the trial judge to be reliable, accurate and competently obtained,
                        he may properly consider it. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Trial Court Must Consider Each Factor in Subsection (c). - In re D.E.P., N.C. App. 796 S.E.2d 509, 514 (2017), created a direct conflict in the area of the law by deviating from precedent; where there is a conflicting line of cases, a panel of this Court
                        should follow the older of those two lines; accordingly, a trial court must consider each of the factors in subsection (c) when entering a dispositional order. In re I.W.P., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite>                        254, 815 S.E.2d 696 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Trial courts may properly consider all written reports and materials submitted in connection with dispositional proceedings. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 303 S.E.2d 636 (1983), modified, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Determination of Delinquency History Points by Stipulation to a Report. - Trial court properly determined a juvenile's delinquency history points, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2507ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2507(f)</a></cite>,
                        because the juvenile stipulated to the court counselor's report, which listed the juvenile's prior adjudications, as the juvenile's attorney received and reviewed the report and failed to object to it. Additionally, the juvenile
                        did not assert in the juvenile's appellate brief that any of the prior adjudications listed in the report did not, in fact, exist. In re DRH, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 668 S.E.2d 919 (2008).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Admissibility of Psychological Reports. - The clear intent of the legislature is that a hearing upon a motion for review is in the nature of a dispositional hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing, and that the formal Rules of Evidence,
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, do not apply. Therefore, the trial court could properly consider written psychological reports in determining on motion brought
                        by parents whose parental rights had been terminated under former G.S. 7A-289.34 (see now 7B-1113), whether the needs of children would be best served by modification of its previous orders concerning visitation. In re Montgomery,
                        <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 709, 336 S.E.2d 136 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Admissibility of Post-petition Occurrences. - Post-petition occurrences were admissible in child neglect proceedings, based on mother's continuing alcohol abuse problems, because the trial court held the adjudication and disposition hearings at the same
                        time, and the mother's post-petition activities reflected on the best interests of the children. Powers v. Powers, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 37, 502 S.E.2d 398 (1998).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consideration of Unadjudicated Acts Unrelated to Petition. - Trial courts giving consideration at a dispositional hearing to unadjudicated acts allegedly committed by a juvenile, unrelated to that for which he stands petitioned, must first determine that
                        such information is reliable and accurate and that it was competently obtained. This does not mean that a full "trial" must be held to make the required determination about the unrelated acts. The trial court should have wide discretion
                        in making the required determination from the sources available to it, but it must make the determination. In re Vinson, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 640</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 591 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section permits the use of unadjudicated acts as evidence to be considered for disposition. In re Barkley, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 267, 300 S.E.2d 713 (1983).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cross-Examination as to Prior Unadjudicated Acts Not Irrelevant. - Cross-examination of juvenile at dispositional hearing about twice running away from county receiving home was not irrelevant merely because the acts about which she was questioned occurred
                        prior to the delinquent act for which she was placed on probation and nothing in the record indicated that she had been adjudicated undisciplined for these acts. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                        171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Failure to Hold Dispositional Hearing Within Six Months. - In juvenile proceedings, a trial court did not lose jurisdiction because it failed to hold a dispositional hearing within six months; instead, the proper interpretation of
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2501ol1d" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2501(d)</a></cite> was that appellant juvenile's family had a six-month window of time to meet appellant's needs without a court-ordered disposition. In re
                        S.S., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 666 S.E.2d 870 (2008).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Effect of Failure to Hold Hearing. - Where the judge held no dispositional hearing and denied juvenile the opportunity to present evidence as to disposition, and there was no evidence to support the findings made by the judge with respect to disposition,
                        commitment order would be reversed so that the court could conduct a dispositional hearing. In re Lail, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 238, 284 S.E.2d 731 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Continuance at Request of Juvenile. - Former G.S. 7A-639 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-808" target="_self">G.S. 7B-808</a></cite>) and former G.S. 7A-640 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-901" target="_self">G.S. 7B-901</a></cite>)
                        made clear the legislative intent that the dispositional hearing must be continued for the juvenile respondent to present evidence when he requests such a continuance. This is particularly so in light of the provision of former
                        G.S. 7A-632 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba08s7B-803" target="_self">G.S. 7B-803</a></cite> and 7B-2406) that "The judge may continue at any time any case to allow additional factual evidence, social information or other
                        information needed in the best interest of the juvenile or in the interest of justice." In re Vinson, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 640</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 591 (1979); In re Lail, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 238,

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a juvenile's motion to continue his dispositional hearing in order to obtain a four-year-old psychological evaluation that was not included in the juvenile's court file under circumstances in which the
                        juvenile's more recent psychological information was included in his juvenile-family data sheet. In re D.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 643 S.E.2d 660 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court abused its discretion by denying a juvenile's motion to continue the disposition because the juvenile had a right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba29s7B-2901ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2901(b)</a></cite> to access
                        additional records, and the trial court should have granted the motion to continue in order to give the juvenile an opportunity to gather evidence for his disposition hearing. In re J.L., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite>                        605, 685 S.E.2d 11 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Burden on Parents and Department. - The language of G.S. 7A-640 (see now this section) and G.S. 7A-657 (see now 7B-906; repealed, see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-906.1" target="_self">G.S. 7B-906.1</a></cite>) does
                        not place any burden of proof upon either the parents or Department of Social Services during the dispositional hearing or the review hearing. The essential requirement at the dispositional hearing and the review hearing is that
                        sufficient evidence be presented to the trial court so that it can determine what is in the best interest of the child. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 567 (1984).

                    <p>
                        Failure of Court to Question Parents. - The trial court did not deny the parents of a juvenile their right to "present evidence" and "advise the court concerning the disposition they believe to be in the best interests of the juvenile" when, after they
                        were tendered to the trial court, the trial court did not question them; the trial court's decision not to question them did not constitute a refusal to allow them to present evidence or to advise the trial court regarding the
                        appropriate disposition. In re Powers, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 546 S.E.2d 186 (2001).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Consideration of Parent's Testimony. - Assuming arguendo that defendant juvenile was correct in the defendant's contention that the trial court decided the terms of the defendant's disposition prior to allowing the defendant's mother to be heard, the
                        error was harmless based on the fact that the mother did not object to the condition of attending classes but effectively agreed with the trial court. In re M.J.G., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite>                        350, 759 S.E.2d 361 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Evidence Did Not Support Transfer of Custody. - Findings of fact in a dispositional order in a delinquency case did not support a trial court's decision to transfer custody of defendant from his mother to his father, and that part of the dispositional
                        order was reversed where the evidence in the record failed to support a finding that placement with the father was in defendant's best interests; the record indicated that defendant had no contact with his father for approximately
                        seven to eight months immediately prior to the assault for which defendant was on trial, the court counselor did not recommend placement with the father and instead advised the court to utilize family services if defendant needed
                        more structure during the day, and it appeared that the trial court based the decision to award custody to the father solely on defendant's school absences. In re Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>                        175, 589 S.E.2d 894 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Failure to preserve objection to juvenile dispositional hearing, even acknowledging the informality allowed in a dispositional hearing, the record gave no indication that juvenile defendant contested the continuance of the dispositional hearing on the
                        grounds that a sex offender specific evaluation was unavailable; defendant was procedurally barred from asserting this argument on appeal. In re J.J.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 777,
                        659 S.E.2d 757 (2008).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court properly exercised its discretion in accord with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2501ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2501(c)</a></cite> when it allowed a juvenile adjudicated delinquent on the basis of first-degree
                        rape to work off campus but not come into contact with anyone aged 25 or younger; such a disposition balanced the importance of protecting the public with the juvenile's rehabilitative needs. In re J.S.W., <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite>                        620, 711 S.E.2d 471 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Level 3 Disposition Proper. - Where juvenile defendant was adjudicated delinquent for having committed assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, and defendant's delinquency history level was determined to have been low, the trial court had
                        the authority to impose either a level 2 or level 3 disposition, and it was within the trial court's discretion to determine which dispositional alternative to impose; where defendant failed to return to school at the end of her
                        five-day suspension, was absent from school for more than 100 days, and where the record revealed that the trial court had before it undisputed evidence that both defendant and her mother knew that defendant was eligible to return
                        to school after the five-day suspension, but were unable to offer an explanation for defendant's failure to return to school, defendant failed to show that the trial court's decision to impose a level 3 disposition amounted to
                        an abuse of discretion. In re N.B., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 605 S.E.2d 488 (2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Juvenile's level 3 disposition was not an abuse of discretion because the juvenile continued to violate probation after being given another chance to continue on a level 2 disposition. In re D.E.P., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite>                        752, 796 S.E.2d 509 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Probationary Conditions Proper. - Probationary conditions in juvenile defendant's manslaughter adjudication that required defendant to visit and put flowers on the victim's grave site, wear a necklace with the victim's picture, and not participate in
                        certain school functions and activities, did not require publicizing defendant's records or present defendant with the choice of staying at home or enduring public ridicule and were not improper; the trial court was cognizant of
                        a psychologist's findings concerning defendant's below average cognitive functioning, but did not afford this evidence as much weight as the other evidence of defendant's actions prior to, during, and after his delinquent act,
                        and the trial court properly considered the evidence before it. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 616 S.E.2d 385 (2005), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 165</cite>, 622 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Trial Court Failed To Include Findings Of Fact In Dispositional Order. - Trial court failed to follow the procedure contemplated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2413" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2413</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2501" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2501</a></cite>,

                        hearing, the trial court must conclude the adjudication stage of the proceedings, receive the predisposition report, then proceed to the dispositional hearing. In re J.J., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 717 S.E.2d
                        59 (2011).

                    <p>
                        District court failed to enter its disposition in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2501ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2501(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2512" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2512</a></cite>                        where, assuming arguendo that the court's categorization of defendant juvenile's simple assault offense as minor and its statement that defendant needed to learn the significance of victimizing people and the consequences of that,
                        sufficiently addressed the first two <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2501ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2501(c)</a></cite> factors, it did not consider the last three factors, including the importance of protecting the public
                        safety, the degree of culpability indicated by the circumstances of the case, and the rehabilitative and treatment needs of the juvenile based on a risk and needs assessment. In re K.C., <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite>                        452, 742 S.E.2d 239 (2013), review denied, 747 S.E.2d 530, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 786 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dispositional order was deficient because although the trial court addressed three of the factors set forth in subsection (c), it did not consider each factor in that section; the form order specifically instructed the trial court to list any additional
                        findings regarding the subsection (c) factors if they were not found elsewhere in the order or incorporated documents, and the supplemental reports and assessments did not address these factors. In re I.W.P.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 815 S.E.2d 696 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Findings Sufficient. - Sufficient factual findings were made in a dispositional order concerning appellant, a juvenile, because the trial court found, beyond a reasonable doubt, (1) crimes were premeditated and willful, (2) a sex crime was very serious,
                        (3) the juvenile denied charges and said sex offender treatment would not benefit the juvenile, and the juvenile had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, requiring a controlled environment, and (4) the juvenile's
                        family's proximity to and relationship with the victim's family made the juvenile's release too dangerous. In re G.C., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 750 S.E.2d 548 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Juvenile's dispositional order did not err for not considering statutory factors because (1) <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2512" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2512</a></cite> did not require findings on those factors, and (2)
                        the court considered the factors, as finding a robbery with a dangerous weapon adjudication showed the crime's seriousness was considered, findings of repeated probation violations showed a need to hold the juvenile accountable
                        was considered, findings of the juvenile's adjudication for armed robbery and school suspension for fighting showed public protection was considered, findings of how the juvenile violated probation showed degree of culpability
                        was considered, and finding the juvenile's failure to obtain treatment showed treatment needs were considered. In re D.E.P., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 752, 796 S.E.2d 509 (2017).

                        In any case, the court may order that the juvenile be examined by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other qualified expert as may be needed for the court to determine the needs of the juvenile. In the case of a juvenile adjudicated delinquent
                        for committing an offense that involves the possession, use, sale, or delivery of alcohol or a controlled substance, the court shall require the juvenile to be tested for the use of controlled substances or alcohol within 30 days
                        of the adjudication. In the case of any juvenile adjudicated delinquent, the court may, if it deems it necessary, require the juvenile to be tested for the use of controlled substances or alcohol. The results of these initial tests
                        conducted pursuant to this subsection shall be used for evaluation and treatment purposes only. In placing a juvenile in out-of-home care under this section, the court shall also consider whether it is in the juvenile's best interest
                        to remain in the juvenile's community of residence.

                        Upon completion of the examination, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the juvenile is in need of medical, surgical, psychiatric, psychological, or other evaluation or treatment and who should pay the cost of the evaluation or treatment.
                        The county manager, or any other person who is designated by the chair of the board of county commissioners, of the county of the juvenile's residence shall be notified of the hearing, and allowed to be heard. If the court finds
                        the juvenile to be in need of medical, surgical, psychiatric, psychological, or other evaluation or treatment, the court shall permit the parent, guardian, custodian, or other responsible persons to arrange for evaluation or treatment.
                        If the parent, guardian, or custodian declines or is unable to make necessary arrangements, the court may order the needed evaluation or treatment, surgery, or care, and the court may order the parent to pay the cost of the care
                        pursuant to Article 27 of this Chapter. If the court finds the parent is unable to pay the cost of evaluation or treatment, the court shall order the county to arrange for evaluation or treatment of the juvenile and to pay for
                        the cost of the evaluation or treatment. The county department of social services shall recommend the facility that will provide the juvenile with evaluation or treatment.

                        If the court believes, or if there is evidence presented to the effect that the juvenile has a mental illness or a developmental disability, the court shall refer the juvenile to the area mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse
                        services director for appropriate action. A juvenile shall not be committed directly to a State hospital or State developmental center, and orders purporting to commit a juvenile directly to a State hospital or State developmental
                        center, except for an examination to determine capacity to proceed, are void and of no effect. The area mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse director is responsible for arranging an interdisciplinary evaluation
                        of the juvenile and mobilizing resources to meet the juvenile's needs. If institutionalization is determined to be the best service for the juvenile, admission shall be with the voluntary consent of the parent, guardian, or custodian.
                        If the parent, guardian, or custodian refuses to consent to institutionalization after it is recommended by the area mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse director, the signature and consent of the court
                        may be substituted for that purpose. In all cases in which a regional mental hospital refuses admission to a juvenile referred for admission by the court and an area mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse

                        1996 Amendment. - As the General Assembly recognized the need for participation by counties in the dispositional stage of a juvenile proceedings it amended subsection (3) of former G.S. 7A-286 to require the trial judge to notify a representative of the
                        county and provide the representative an opportunity to be heard at a juvenile's dispositional hearing. In re D.R.D., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 296, 488 S.E.2d 842 (1997).

                    <p>
                        The provision in subsection (6) of former G.S. 7A-286 that a juvenile judge may not commit a child directly to a mental institution was clearly designed to prevent conflicts with various statutes under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite>.
                        In re Mikels, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 230 S.E.2d 155 (1976).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> was written to provide constitutional defense, procedural, and evidentiary rules. To allow juvenile judges to commit minors to
                        mental institutions with a lesser standard than that set forth in former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> would subject such commitments to constitutional challenge
                        as a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In re Mikels, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 230 S.E.2d 155 (1976).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        "Cost of care" does not include counsel fees for juvenile, which are governed by former G.S. 7A-588 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba06s7B-603" target="_self">G.S. 7B-603</a></cite> and 7B-2002). In re Wharton, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite>                        447, 283 S.E.2d 528 (1981), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 565</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 688 (1982).

                    <p>
                        Consecutive commitments are not contrary to the philosophy of the Juvenile Code. Such reasoning would mean that once a juvenile had been committed to a detention facility or training school (now youth development center) he would be free to commit whatever
                        other illegal acts he so chose knowing that he could not receive any additional punishment for his action. This was not the intention of the legislature when it adopted the Juvenile Code. In re Thompson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 666</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 499 (1985).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Juvenile Code does not contain any provision which prohibits the commitment of a juvenile to consecutive terms of detention. Absent an express prohibition, the common-law rule that the courts have the authority to commit offenders to consecutive terms
                        of confinement is controlling. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 666</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 499 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Reasonable and Available Non-Statutory Alternatives. - Prior to committing a juvenile to the Division of Youth Services, the court must also consider any reasonable and available nonstatutory community-level alternatives. In re Mosser,
                        <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 393 S.E.2d 308 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Intermediate Disposition Appropriate. - Level 2 intermediate disposition was proper in a juvenile case pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2508ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2508(f)</a></cite> because appellant had
                        1 point for prior offenses and had a serious offense combined with a low delinquency level; ordered intermediate disposition, that appellant participate in a wilderness program, submit to intermittent confinement of 14 days in
                        an approved detention facility, and perform 50 hours of community service, was within the range of statutorily permissible dispositions, and this decision was not manifestly unsupported by reason and within the discretion of the
                        trial court. In re K.L.D., <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 709 S.E.2d 409 (2011).

        Trial Court's Failure to Refer.
       </b> - Trial court erred in failing to refer the defendant juvenile to the area mental health services director; the predisposition report referred to a clinical assessment, which diagnosed the juvenile with conduct disorder
                        and recommended intensive outpatient services. In re E.A., - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 630 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in failing to refer a juvenile to the area mental health services director for appropriate action, as required by statute, before committing her to a youth development center (YDC) because the trial court was faced with evidence that
                        the juvenile was mentally ill, the juvenile demonstrated a reasonable possibility that compliance with the statute and review of the required evaluation would have resulted in a different disposition, and the trial court lacked
                        the opportunity to weigh any mental health care clinicians' reasoning against the State's recommendation for commitment to a YDC. In re A.L.B., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Failure to Order Psychiatric Examination Precluded Commitment. - Where finding that juvenile was manic-depressive was supported only by a statement made to trial court by mother of the juvenile, this evidence of mental illness compelled further inquiry
                        by trial court prior to entry of any final disposition; however, while trial court had authority to order a psychiatric examination of juvenile and gain advice of a medical specialist, he failed to utilize this community resource
                        and such failure precludes commitment to the Division of Youth Services. In re Mosser, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 393 S.E.2d 308 (1990).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in committing defendant to a youth development center and transferring his legal custody to the county department of social services because it failed to refer defendant to the area mental health services director after being presented
                        with evidence that he was mentally ill, as required by statute; the trial court was presented with a plethora of evidence demonstrating that defendant was mentally ill. In re E.M., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite>                        476, 823 S.E.2d 674 (2019), review denied, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 880 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use of the word "shall" indicates a statutory mandate that the trial court refer the juvenile to the area mental health services director for appropriate action, and failure to do so is error; faced with any amount of evidence that a juvenile is mentally
                        ill, a trial court has a statutory duty to refer the juvenile to the area mental health services director for appropriate action. In re E.M., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 823 S.E.2d 674
                        (2019), review denied, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 880 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Statute envisions the area mental health services director's involvement in the juvenile's disposition and responsibility for arranging an interdisciplinary evaluation of the juvenile and mobilizing resources to meet the juvenile's needs. In re E.M.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 823 S.E.2d 674 (2019), review denied, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 880 (2019).

                        Commitment of Juvenile to Training School (Now Youth Development Center) Held Proper. - Court exhausted all alternatives and properly committed a juvenile to training school (now youth development center) after the juvenile violated conditions of probation
                        for second degree rape and taking indecent liberties with a child. In re Molina, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 373, 511 S.E.2d 679 (1999).

                        There is no authorization in the statutes to grant legal and physical custody of a juvenile to the Willie M. Services Section of the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services, although juvenile's guardian ad litem
                        argued that the Division of Youth Services, also a Division of the Department of Human Resources, is a "person" within the purview of former G.S. 7A-647. In re Autry, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite>                        263, 444 S.E.2d 239 (1994), aff'd per curiam, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 95</cite>, 455 S.E.2d 155 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Consecutive commitments are not contrary to the philosophy of the Juvenile Code. Such reasoning would mean that once a juvenile had been committed to a detention facility or training school (now youth development center) he would be free to commit whatever
                        other illegal acts he so chose knowing that he could not receive any additional punishment for his action. This was not the intention of the legislature when it adopted the Juvenile Code. In re Thompson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 666</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 499 (1985).

                    <p>
                        The Juvenile Code does not contain any provision which prohibits the commitment of a juvenile to consecutive terms of detention. Absent an express prohibition, the common-law rule that the courts have the authority to commit offenders to consecutive terms
                        of confinement is controlling. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 666</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 499 (1985).

                        order the parent of a juvenile adjudicated as delinquent, undisciplined, abused, neglected, or dependent to participate in medical, psychiatric, psychological or other treatment ordered for the juvenile pursuant to former G.S.
                        7A-647(3). Former G.S. 7A-650(b1) does not authorize the court to order a juvenile's parent to otherwise submit to medical, psychiatric, psychological or other assessment or treatment.

                        Delegation of Authority - Trial court erred in entering a dispositional order that directed the juvenile to cooperate with placement in a residential treatment facility "if deemed necessary" by either of two counselors as statutory law did not give the
                        trial court authority to delegate its authority in entering a dispositional order. In re Hartsock, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 580 S.E.2d 395 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because a trial court ordered a juvenile defendant to pay restitution and participate in a residential treatment program, it did not impermissibly delegate authority; instead, defendant was ordered to pay restitution, but the amount was left to be determined
                        until the victim's medical bills were provided to the trial court, which comported with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2506" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2506</a></cite>. In re M.A.B., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite>                        192, 611 S.E.2d 886 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Rule that a trial court may not delegate or vest its discretion in another person or entity applies to a trial court's order of probation pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2506" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2506(8)</a></cite>                        and the underlying conditions of that term of probation, which are governed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2510" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2510</a></cite>; special conditions of probation that respondent juvenile cooperate
                        with any out-of-home placement if deemed necessary by the court counselor and that he cooperate with any counseling or assessment recommended by the court counselor were impermissible delegations of the trial court's authority.
                        In re S.R.S., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 636 S.E.2d 277 (2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not improperly delegate its authority to a third party because it exercised its discretion in implementing probationary conditions; the trial court selected community dispositions within the allowed subdivisions permitted by the Level
                        1 designation, and it and did not delegate decisions on whether to enforce them to a third party but instead, directed the court counselor and parents to handle the day-to-day implementation of the particular probationary conditions.
                        In re I.W.P., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 815 S.E.2d 696 (2018).

                        The legislature intended for the court to consider all information relevant to the disposition of a delinquent child. In re Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 251 S.E.2d 643 (1979).

                    <p>
                        There is no authorization in the statutes to grant legal and physical custody of a juvenile to the Willie M. Services Section of the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services, although juvenile's guardian ad litem
                        argued that the Division of Youth Services, also a Division of the Department of Human Resources, is a "person" within the purview of former G.S. 7A-647. In re Autry, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite>                        263, 444 S.E.2d 239 (1994), aff'd per curiam, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 95</cite>, 455 S.E.2d 155 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Consecutive commitments are not contrary to the philosophy of the Juvenile Code. Such reasoning would mean that once a juvenile had been committed to a detention facility or training school (now youth development center) he would be free to commit whatever
                        other illegal acts he so chose knowing that he could not receive any additional punishment for his action. This was not the intention of the legislature when it adopted the Juvenile Code. In re Thompson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 666</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 499 (1985).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Juvenile Code does not contain any provision which prohibits the commitment of a juvenile to consecutive terms of detention. Absent an express prohibition, the common-law rule that the courts have the authority to commit offenders to consecutive terms
                        of confinement is controlling. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 666</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 499 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Confinement Not Authorized. - When a trial court found that a juvenile appellant violated his probation, it was governed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2510" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2510</a></cite>, and was authorized
                        to order a new disposition at Level 2, the next higher level from the original disposition at Level 1; commitment was not an allowable Level 2 disposition, so the trial court was not authorized to impose commitment, stayed or unstayed.
                        In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 631 S.E.2d 857 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Intermittent Confinement Improperly Ordered - Although the trial court had the authority to order that the juvenile be confined on an intermittent basis in an approved detention facility, statutory law required that the timing of the confinement be determined
                        by the trial court in its discretion and the applicable form left space for instruction as to that timing; the trial court erred in not filling in the timing since it left the space blank and, thus, that portion of the disposition
                        order was incomplete and had no effect. In re Hartsock, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 580 S.E.2d 395 (2003).

                        Participation of Parent in Assessment or Treatment. - Former G.S. 7A-650(b1) (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-904" target="_self">G.S. 7B-904</a></cite>, 7B-2702 and 7B-2704) only authorizes the district court to

                        psychiatric, psychological or other assessment or treatment. In re Badzinski, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 339 S.E.2d 80, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 703</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 35 (1986).

                        Power to Order Sex Offender Treatment. - The district court had power to order the Department of Human Resources, Division of Youth Services to give sex offender treatment to an adolescent found delinquent because of sex offenses and subsequently to deny
                        the conditional release of that adolescent because treatment had not been in compliance with that mandate. In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 743</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 798 (1991).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The district court is authorized to permit the Division of Youth Services, as the "person" responsible for a juvenile in its custody, to arrange for psychological counseling for sexual offenders. When the agency, as custodian, fails to make such arrangements,
                        the court is authorized by statute to "order the needed treatment." In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 743</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 798 (1991).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ordering Division of Youth Services to provide specific treatment for sexual offenders for a delinquent juvenile in its custody, when such treatment was available, was within the scope of the court's statutory authority. In re Doe,
                        <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 743</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 798 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Power to Order Restitution. - The trial court made appropriate findings of fact based on evidence in the record that the juvenile had or could reasonably acquire the means to pay specified restitution within the 12 month probationary period where the
                        court found as fact that the juvenile was 16 years old at the time of the disposition, and lawfully ordered him to obtain a full time job, thus enabling him to make restitution, and made provisions to adjust the weekly payments
                        required by the order if he returned to school in the fall. In re Schrimpsher, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 461, 546 S.E.2d 407 (2001).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Restitution Where None of the Co-Defendants Had to Pay. - The trial court erred in requiring that the defendant alone make restitution, and failed to make adequate findings enabling review of that requirement, when the record revealed that at least one
                        other juvenile co-defendant was adjudicated delinquent for breaking and entering and causing injury to local lodge, and that none of the other co-defendants, whether juvenile or adult, were ordered to pay restitution. In re Schrimpsher,
                        <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 461, 546 S.E.2d 407 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Restitution Order Improper. - Restitution order entered pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2506" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2506(4)</a></cite> was reversed in a juvenile case because the trial court failed to make findings
                        regarding whether restitution was in the juvenile's best interest and whether restitution was fair to the juvenile; instead, the trial court based its decision on a desire to avoid an injustice to the victim. In re D.A.Q.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 535, 715 S.E.2d 509 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Requirement That People with Whom Juvenile Lives Submit to Warrantless Searches. - The court may not require that those with whom the juvenile associates submit to warrantless searches as a condition of the juvenile's probation; it is unfair and unreasonable
                        to place the success of the juvenile's probation on the acts of others. In re Schrimpsher, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 461, 546 S.E.2d 407 (2001).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Probationary Conditions Proper. - Probationary conditions in juvenile defendant's manslaughter adjudication that required defendant to visit and put flowers on the victim's grave site, wear a necklace with the victim's picture, and not participate in
                        certain school functions and activities, did not require publicizing defendant's records or present defendant with the choice of staying at home or enduring public ridicule and were not improper; the trial court was cognizant of
                        a psychologist's findings concerning defendant's below average cognitive functioning, but did not afford this evidence as much weight as the other evidence of defendant's actions prior to, during, and after his delinquent act,
                        and the trial court properly considered the evidence before it. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 616 S.E.2d 385 (2005), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 165</cite>, 622 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Level 3 Classification Proper. - Trial court possessed the discretion to enter a delinquency Level 3 based on an adjudication of assault on a government employee, a class A1 misdemeanor, and the juvenile's "high" prior delinquency history. In re D.A.S.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 643 S.E.2d 660 (2007).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Intermediate Disposition Appropriate. - Level 2 intermediate disposition was proper in a juvenile case pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2508ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2508(f)</a></cite> because appellant had
                        1 point for prior offenses and had a serious offense combined with a low delinquency level; ordered intermediate disposition, that appellant participate in a wilderness program, submit to intermittent confinement of 14 days in
                        an approved detention facility, and perform 50 hours of community service, was within the range of statutorily permissible dispositions, and this decision was not manifestly unsupported by reason and within the discretion of the
                        trial court. In re K.L.D., <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 709 S.E.2d 409 (2011).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence Did Not Support Transfer of Custody. - Findings of fact in a dispositional order in a delinquency case did not support a trial court's decision to transfer custody of defendant from his mother to his father, and that part of the dispositional
                        order was reversed where the evidence in the record failed to support a finding that placement with the father was in defendant's best interests; the record indicated that defendant had no contact with his father for approximately
                        seven to eight months immediately prior to the assault for which defendant was on trial, the court counselor did not recommend placement with the father and instead advised the court to utilize family services if defendant needed
                        more structure during the day, and it appeared that the trial court based the decision to award custody to the father solely on defendant's school absences. In re Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>                        175, 589 S.E.2d 894 (2004).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transfer of Custody to Department of Social Services Was Proper. - Trial court was authorized to grant custody of respondent, who had been adjudicated delinquent based on a finding that respondent committed involuntary manslaughter, to the Department
                        of Social Services for purposes of obtaining necessary evaluation and treatment pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2506" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2506(1)(c)</a></cite>. Respondent had a history
                        of aggressive behavior directed at younger children and a facility that offered 24-hour monitoring would ensure that respondent did not cause any further harm to other children. In re K.T.L., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                        365, 629 S.E.2d 152 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 472</cite> 642 S.E.2d 442 (2007).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remand Required for New Disposition. - Although the most lenient sentencing alternatives for juveniles was imposed under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2506" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2506</a></cite> for the nine petitions,
                        it was unclear whether the trial court would have altered the disposition order had the trial court properly adjudicated the juvenile delinquent based solely upon the two petitions in support of which the State submitted sufficient
                        evidence. Even though remand might result in the same disposition based solely upon the two valid adjudications, remand was required for a new disposition. In re R.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 664 S.E.2d
                        71 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Power to Reinstate Sentence - Trial court did not err in reinstating a juvenile's sentence after she violated the terms of her probation because the trial court was authorized to activate a juvenile's suspended fourteen-day sentence and impose an additional
                        suspended fourteen-day period of confinement based on the juvenile's admitted probation violation at another hearing, for a total of twenty-eight days confinement, and the trial court's findings of fact were sufficient to support
                        the extension of juvenile's probation; pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2510ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2510(e)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2506" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2506</a></cite>                        and -2508, a trial court can impose up to and no more than twenty-eight days confinement in an approved juvenile detention facility for a Level 2 disposition. In re D.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 679 S.E.2d
                        449 (2009), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 214</cite> (2010).

                        No Credit for Time Served Prior to Disposition - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html#t15a19As15-196.1" target="_blank">G.S. 15-196.1</a></cite>, which allows for defendants to receive credit for time served in
                        confinement prior to final disposition, is inapplicable to juvenile matters, and a term of juvenile confinement, therefore, may not be reduced by time spent in court-ordered custody before disposition. In re D.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 214</cite>,
                        694 S.E.2d 753 (June 17, 2010).

                        to credit for time served in secure custody pending the juvenile's dispositional hearings; the General Statutes did not authorize credit for time served before disposition in the juvenile context. In re D.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 214</cite>,

                        Prior Adjudication. - Trial court properly considered a juvenile's larceny of a firearm offense as a prior adjudication pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2507ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2507(a)</a></cite> where
                        the adjudication of that offense occurred prior to the 4 March 2013 disposition hearing and entry of the disposition on his offenses. In re P.Q.M., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 419, 754 S.E.2d 431 (2014).

                        the juvenile stipulated to the court counselor's report, which listed the juvenile's prior adjudications, as the juvenile's attorney received and reviewed the report and failed to object to it. Additionally, the juvenile did not
                        assert in the juvenile's appellate brief that any of the prior adjudications listed in the report did not, in fact, exist. In re DRH, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 668 S.E.2d 919 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Intermediate Disposition Appropriate. - Level 2 intermediate disposition was proper in a juvenile case pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2508ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2508(f)</a></cite> because appellant had
                        1 point for prior offenses and had a serious offense combined with a low delinquency level; ordered intermediate disposition, that appellant participate in a wilderness program, submit to intermittent confinement of 14 days in
                        an approved detention facility, and perform 50 hours of community service, was within the range of statutorily permissible dispositions, and this decision was not manifestly unsupported by reason and within the discretion of the
                        trial court. In re K.L.D., <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 709 S.E.2d 409 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Level 3 Disposition Proper. - Where juvenile defendant was adjudicated delinquent for having committed assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, and defendant's delinquency history level was determined to have been low, the trial court had
                        the authority to impose either a level 2 or level 3 disposition, and it was within the trial court's discretion to determine which dispostional alternative to impose; where defendant failed to return to school at the end of her
                        five-day suspension, was absent from school for more than 100 days, and where the record revealed that the trial court had before it undisputed evidence that both defendant and her mother knew that defendant was eligible to return
                        to school after the five-day suspension, but were unable to offer an explanation for defendant's failure to return to school, defendant failed to show that the trial court's decision to impose a level 3 disposition amounted to
                        an abuse of discretion. In re N.B., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 605 S.E.2d 488 (2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Assault on a government employee was a class A1 misdemeanor; a trial court possessed the discretion to enter a delinquency Level 3 based on a juvenile adjudication of assault on a government employee, and the juvenile's "high" prior delinquency history.
                        In re D.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 643 S.E.2d 660 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Level 3 Disposition Improper. - It was error to deny a juvenile's motion to modify the juvenile's disposition because the court wrongly assigned two delinquency history points for being on probation at the time of an offense when the juvenile was not
                        on probation, so the court had no authority to impose a level 3 disposition. In re A.F., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 752 S.E.2d 245 (2013).

                        Delegation of Authority. - Trial court did not improperly delegate its authority to a third party because it exercised its discretion in implementing probationary conditions; the trial court selected community dispositions within the allowed subdivisions
                        permitted by the Level 1 designation, and it and did not delegate decisions on whether to enforce them to a third party but instead, directed the court counselor and parents to handle the day-to-day implementation of the particular
                        probationary conditions. In re I.W.P., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 815 S.E.2d 696 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Level 3 Disposition. - The trial court committed no error in using a juvenile's previous commitment to training school (now youth development center) as a basis for imposing a Level 3 disposition and again committing her to training school (now youth
                        development center). In re Allison, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 547 S.E.2d 169 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Where juvenile defendant was adjudicated delinquent for having committed assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, and defendant's delinquency history level was determined to have been been low, the trial court had the authority to impose
                        either a level 2 or level 3 disposition, and it was within the trial court's discretion to determine which dispostional alternative to impose; where defendant failed to return to school at the end of her five-day suspension, was
                        absent from school for more than 100 days, and where the record revealed that the trial court had before it undisputed evidence that both defendant and her mother knew that defendant was eligible to return to school after the five-day
                        suspension, but were unable to offer an explanation for defendant's failure to return to school, defendant failed to show that the trial court's decision to impose a level 3 disposition amounted to an abuse of discretion. In re
                        N.B., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 605 S.E.2d 488 (2004).

                        When appellant, a juvenile, had a violent offense, first-degree sexual assault, and a low delinquency history, the court did not err in ordering him to a youth development center; the decision was a reasoned one, given evidence that appellant had a strong
                        sexual interest in younger children, that he might reoffend, and that rape might sexually excite him, and an evaluation which stated that appellant might be more suitable for treatment in a secure environment and that he should
                        not have unsupervised contact with children aged 11 or under. In re D.A.F., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 832, 635 S.E.2d 509 (2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Assault on a government employee was a class A1 misdemeanor; a trial court possessed the discretion to enter a delinquency Level 3 based on a juvenile adjudication of assault on a government employee, and the juvenile's "high" prior delinquency history.
                        In re D.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 643 S.E.2d 660 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Juvenile failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing a level 3 disposition where the evidence showed that he had a medium risk and medium needs, he could not receive the level of structure he needed at home, and nothing in the
                        record indicated that the court's failure to find that the juvenile had extraordinary needs was so arbitrary that it could not have been the result of a reasoned decision. In re P.Q.M., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite>                        419, 754 S.E.2d 431 (2014).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Juvenile's level 3 disposition was not an abuse of discretion because the juvenile continued to violate probation after being given another chance to continue on a level 2 disposition. In re D.E.P., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite>                        752, 796 S.E.2d 509 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Level 3 Disposition Improper. - Order entering a level 3 disposition and commitment order based on a juvenile's violation of probation was error because it was undisputed that underlying offense was classified as a minor offense under
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2508" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2508</a></cite>, and the plain language of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2510ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2510(f)</a></cite> specifically prohibited the
                        entry of a new disposition at level 3; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2508" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2508</a></cite>(g) did not require a different result. In re S.B., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. App.</cite> 741, 701 S.E.2d
                        359 (2010).

                    <p>
                        It was error to deny a juvenile's motion to modify the juvenile's disposition because the court wrongly assigned two delinquency history points for being on probation at the time of an offense when the juvenile was not on probation, so the court had no
                        authority to impose a level 3 disposition. In re A.F., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 752 S.E.2d 245 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Intermediate Disposition Appropriate. - Level 2 intermediate disposition was proper in a juvenile case pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2508ol1f" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2508(f)</a></cite> because appellant had
                        1 point for prior offenses and had a serious offense combined with a low delinquency level; ordered intermediate disposition, that appellant participate in a wilderness program, submit to intermittent confinement of 14 days in
                        an approved detention facility, and perform 50 hours of community service, was within the range of statutorily permissible dispositions, and this decision was not manifestly unsupported by reason and within the discretion of the
                        trial court. In re K.L.D., <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 709 S.E.2d 409 (2011).

                        Consolidation of Adjudications. - Pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2508ol1h" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2508(h)</a></cite>, a trial court was required to consolidate a juvenile's adjudications for robbery with a dangerous
                        weapon and felony conspiracy into a single disposition for robbery with a dangerous weapon, the juvenile's most serious offense. Accordingly, the trial court's disposition and commitment orders were vacated, and the case was remanded
                        for the entry of a single disposition order. In re DRH, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 668 S.E.2d 919 (2008).

                        days in three different calendar weeks in three different sessions, the trial court had merely transferred the juvenile's robbery with a dangerous weapon from one county to another county, and that transfer order did not require
                        consolidation. In re P.Q.M., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 419, 754 S.E.2d 431 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Sentencing for First Degree Sex Offenses With a Child. - Juvenile defendant failed to argue how the absence of a sex offender specific evaluation hindered the trial court's ability to properly sentence him on his adjudication for first degree sex offenses
                        with a child, which was a violent felony. In re J.J.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 777, 659 S.E.2d 757 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Confinement Not Authorized. - When a trial court found that a juvenile appellant violated his probation, it was governed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2510" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2510</a></cite>, and was authorized
                        to order a new disposition at Level 2, the next higher level from the original disposition at Level 1; commitment was not an allowable Level 2 disposition, so the trial court was not authorized to impose commitment, stayed or unstayed.
                        In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 631 S.E.2d 857 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Power to Reinstate Sentence - Trial court did not err in reinstating a juvenile's sentence after she violated the terms of her probation because the trial court was authorized to activate a juvenile's suspended fourteen-day sentence and impose an additional
                        suspended fourteen-day period of confinement based on the juvenile's admitted probation violation at another hearing, for a total of twenty-eight days confinement, and the trial court's findings of fact were sufficient to support
                        the extension of juvenile's probation; pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2510ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2510(e)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2506" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2506</a></cite>                        and -2508, a trial court can impose up to and no more than twenty-eight days confinement in an approved juvenile detention facility for a Level 2 disposition.

                        Violation of Conditions of Probation. - Where respondent juvenile was initially placed on probation as an "undisciplined" child for unlawful absence from school, and his probation was continued when he was adjudicated a delinquent for damage to property
                        by shooting out the windows and screens of a home with an air rifle and again when he was adjudicated a delinquent for stealing $60.00 from a purse, his probationary status resulted from delinquent behavior rather than merely from
                        the undisciplined behavior upon which it was initially grounded, and the juvenile court had authority to commit respondent to the custody of the Division of Youth Services for placement in one of its residential facilities upon
                        finding respondent in violation of the conditions of his probation subsequent to the adjudications that he was delinquent. In re Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 273 S.E.2d 324 (1981),
                        (decided prior to the enactment of this Chapter).

                    <p>
                        When a juvenile admitted a violation of his probation due to being physically aggressive with another juvenile, the double jeopardy clause did not preclude his subsequent delinquency adjudication based on that behavior, as double jeopardy did not apply
                        to his probation revocation hearing; any punishment to which he was exposed by virtue of that hearing was punishment for the offense for which he was originally placed on probation, rather than punishment for the offense on which
                        his probation violation was based, so he was not being punished twice for the same offense. In re O'Neal, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 585 S.E.2d 478 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 657</cite>,

                    <p>
                        When a trial court found that a juvenile appellant violated his probation, it was governed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2510" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2510</a></cite>, and was authorized to order a new disposition at
                        Level 2, the next higher level from the original disposition at Level 1; commitment was not an allowable Level 2 disposition, so the trial court was not authorized to impose commitment, stayed or unstayed. In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite>                        542, 631 S.E.2d 857 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Where a juvenile's court supervision was revoked for probation violations, it was not error to fail to make the specific inquiries enumerated in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407</a></cite>,
                        because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2407" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2407</a></cite> did not apply to the juvenile's admission, or admissions by the juvenile through the juvenile's attorney, that the juvenile violated conditions
                        of court supervision. In re D.J.M., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 126, 638 S.E.2d 610 (2007).

                        Trial court did not err in reinstating a juvenile's sentence after she violated the terms of her probation because the trial court was authorized to activate a juvenile's suspended fourteen-day sentence and impose an additional suspended fourteen-day
                        period of confinement based on the juvenile's admitted probation violation at another hearing, for a total of twenty-eight days confinement, and the trial court's findings of fact were sufficient to support the extension of juvenile's

                        Trial court did not err in finding that the juvenile had willfully violated the terms and conditions of his probation because, since he had been placed on probation, defendant had had numerous unexcused absences from school and had violated school rules
                        by communicating threats to a teacher; and, even if the trial court erred in finding that the juvenile had the ability to control his behavior and did not willfully violate the school rules when he communicated threats to a teacher,
                        that fact had no bearing on the extent to which he was willfully absent from school without a valid excuse on numerous occasions in violation of his probation. In re Z.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite>                        365, 767 S.E.2d 660 (2014).

                        Probationary Conditions Proper. - Probationary conditions in juvenile defendant's manslaughter adjudication that required defendant to visit and put flowers on the victim's grave site, wear a necklace with the victim's picture, and not participate in
                        certain school functions and activities, did not require publicizing defendant's records or present defendant with the choice of staying at home or enduring public ridicule and were not improper; the trial court was cognizant of
                        a psychologist's findings concerning defendant's below average cognitive functioning, but did not afford this evidence as much weight as the other evidence of defendant's actions prior to, during, and after his delinquent act,

                        Level 3 Disposition Improper. - Order entering a level 3 disposition and commitment order based on a juvenile's violation of probation was error because it was undisputed that underlying offense was classified as a minor offense under

                        entry of a new disposition at level 3; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2508" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2508</a></cite>(g) did not require a different result. In re S.B., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. App.</cite> 741, 701 S.E.2d

                        When, at disposition, a juvenile was assigned two delinquency history points for being on probation at the time of an offense, but the juvenile was not on probation at the relevant time, the juvenile's acknowledgment that the juvenile's delinquency history
                        could subject the juvenile to a level 3 disposition and concession of the existence of the challenged delinquency history points before entry of the contested disposition did not expressly extend the juvenile's probation because
                        this procedure did not satisfy <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2510" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2510</a></cite>, as no hearing was held on extending probation. In re A.F., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite>                        348, 752 S.E.2d 245 (2013).

                        Motion for review accurately stated the expiration date of defendant juvenile's probation, and the violations listed in the facts and circumstances section all occurred after defendant was placed on probation, such that the motion for review provided
                        adequate notice that he was alleged to have violated the conditions of the only term of probation to which he was then subject; assuming the motion for review failed to provide defendant with notice that he could receive a Level
                        III disposition for violation of probation conditions, the record established that he had actual notice of his legal status and the trial court did not err in imposing a Level III disposition. In re D.S.B.,

                        Trial Court's Authority. - When the motion for review was filed, the only probationary term to which defendant juvenile was subject was the Level II disposition imposed in 2013 for larceny, and a violation of the earlier probation, which had expired,
                        would not have provided the trial court with authority to enter a new disposition. In re D.S.B., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 768 S.E.2d 922 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in committing a juvenile to a youth development center for a minimum of six months up to his 18th birthday because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter a second dispositional order on the juvenile's probation violations when
                        it had already entered a disposition order continuing him on probation and there were no motions for review filed, notice, or hearings conducted after the first disposition order.

                        Delegation of Authority. - Rule that a trial court may not delegate or vest its discretion in another person or entity applies to a trial court's order of probation pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2506" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2506(8)</a></cite>                        and the underlying conditions of that term of probation, which are governed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2510" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2510</a></cite>; special conditions of probation that respondent juvenile cooperate
                        with any out-of-home placement if deemed necessary by the court counselor and that he cooperate with any counseling or assessment recommended by the court counselor were impermissible delegations of the trial court's authority.

                        Where a trial court ordered defendant juvenile to continue on probation with the new condition that defendant cooperate with an out of home placement and be placed in detention until the placement was available, the court did not violate

                        details of the out of home placement with an organization, it did not delegate its authority as to which dispositional alternatives were imposed in the new juvenile order.

                        Violation of Conditions of Probation. - Where respondent juvenile was initially placed on probation as an "undisciplined" child for unlawful absence from school, and his probation was continued when he was adjudicated a delinquent for damage to property
                        by shooting out the windows and screens of a home with an air rifle and again when he was adjudicated a delinquent for stealing $60.00 from a purse, his probationary status resulted from delinquent behavior rather than merely from
                        the undisciplined behavior upon which it was initially grounded, and the juvenile court had authority to commit respondent to the custody of the Division of Youth Services for placement in one of its residential facilities upon
                        finding respondent in violation of the conditions of his probation subsequent to the adjudications that he was delinquent. In re Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 273 S.E.2d 324 (1981).

                        Procedural validity of a dispositional order would be evaluated in light of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, and
                        this section. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

                        Former G.S. 7A-651 does not require the trial judge to announce his findings and conclusions in open court, mandating only that the terms of the disposition be stated in open court with "particularity." In re Bullabough,
                        <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

                        Judge May Make Oral Entry of Order. - Under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 58, a judge may make an oral entry of a juvenile order, provided the order
                        is subsequently reduced to written form as required by this section. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

                    <p>
                        In a juvenile delinquency proceeding, a trial court's oral findings as to whether the State had proved the allegations against a juvenile sufficed; however, the written order had to be corrected so that the record reflected the finding. In re Rikard,
                        <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 587 S.E.2d 467 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Commitment Order Not Authorized. - When a trial court found that a juvenile appellant violated his probation, it was governed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2510" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2510</a></cite>, and was authorized
                        to order a new disposition at Level 2, the next higher level from the original disposition at Level 1; commitment was not an allowable Level 2 disposition, so the trial court was not authorized to impose commitment, stayed or unstayed.
                        In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 631 S.E.2d 857 (2006).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Written dispositional order entered by juvenile court, which conformed generally with oral announcement of the order in open court, was valid. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The written order terminating respondent's parental rights which contained language not included in the trial court's recital in open court did not violate former G.S. 7A-651 where the findings about which respondent complained related to the "adjudication"
                        by the trial court, pursuant to the provisions of former G.S. 7A-289.32, that grounds for termination of respondent's parental rights existed at the time of the hearing, not to the court's "disposition" pursuant to former G.S.
                        7A-289.31 and where the order entered by the trial court was in "general conformity" to the disposition announced in open court. In re Brim, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 535 S.E.2d 367
                        (2000).

                    <p>
                        Evidence Did Not Support Transfer of Custody. - Findings of fact in a dispositional order in a delinquency case did not support a trial court's decision to transfer custody of defendant from his mother to his father, and that part of the dispositional
                        order was reversed where the evidence in the record failed to support a finding that placement with the father was in defendant's best interests; the record indicated that defendant had no contact with his father for approximately
                        seven to eight months immediately prior to the assault for which defendant was on trial, the court counselor did not recommend placement with the father and instead advised the court to utilize family services if defendant needed
                        more structure during the day, and it appeared that the trial court based the decision to award custody to the father solely on defendant's school absences. In re Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>                        175, 589 S.E.2d 894 (2004).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence in Support of Commitment Insufficient. - Where the court counselor merely stated that a juvenile "probably" would not be accepted into alternative placements, the evidence did not support a finding that other alternatives were explored as required
                        by former section before the juvenile was committed to the Division of Youth Services. In re Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 122, 510 S.E.2d 190 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Implication of Separation as Pre-Condition to Reunification Deemed Prejudicial. - Although the court was authorized under former G.S. 7A-651(c)(2) to find that efforts to reunite a family would be futile or inconsistent with the juvenile's safety, the
                        court's statements implying that separation of the parents was a pre-condition to the mother having a realistic chance to regain custody were prejudicial error, and the part of the court's order retaining jurisdiction was, therefore,
                        vacated. In re McLean, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 521 S.E.2d 121 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Restitution Order Vacated. - Where although the record contained substantial evidence that victim suffered great damage to his mobile home, juveniles were charged only with breaking windows and damaging the doors of his property, and admitted only to
                        throwing rocks through some of the windows in the mobile home and nothing further, and there was no evidence in the record as to the amount of damage caused by the rocks thrown by the juveniles, dispositional order ordering restitution
                        in the amount of $3,000.00 would be vacated and the matter remanded for a new dispositional hearing, at which the court would determine the amount of damages caused to the mobile home by the rocks thrown through the windows by
                        the juveniles. In re Hull, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 221 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Findings and Conclusions Contained in Dispositional Order Not Applicable to Conditional Release. - Findings that a juvenile defendant violated his release conditions based upon his failure to comply with the rules and regulations of his group home, and
                        that the violations were without just cause or legal dispute were sufficient to support the trial court's revocation of defendant's post-release supervision pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2516" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2516</a></cite>;
                        because a conditional release from the Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention was not the same as probation or final discharge, the requisite findings and conclusions contained in a dispositional order pursuant
                        to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2512" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2512</a></cite> were not applicable. Once defendant's post-release supervision was revoked, return to the Youth Development Center was mandated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2516" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2516</a></cite>(c).
                        In re D.M., <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 729, 666 S.E.2d 501 (2008).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Trial Court Failed to Include Findings of Fact in Dispositional Order. - Trial court failed to follow the procedure contemplated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba24s7B-2413" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2413</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2501" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2501</a></cite>,
                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2512" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2512</a></cite> for dispositional hearings because it failed to include the requisite findings of fact in its dispositional order; regarding the dispositional
                        hearing, the trial court must conclude the adjudication stage of the proceedings, receive the predisposition report, then proceed to the dispositional hearing. In re J.J., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 717 S.E.2d
                        59 (2011).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        District court failed to enter its disposition in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2501ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2501(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2512" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2512</a></cite>                        where, assuming arguendo that the court's categorization of defendant juvenile's simple assault offense as minor and its statement that defendant needed to learn the significance of victimizing people and the consequences of that,
                        sufficiently addressed the first two <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2501ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2501(c)</a></cite> factors, it did not consider the last three factors, including the importance of protecting the public
                        safety, the degree of culpability indicated by the circumstances of the case, and the rehabilitative and treatment needs of the juvenile based on a risk and needs assessment. In re K.C., <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite>                        452, 742 S.E.2d 239 (2013), review denied, 747 S.E.2d 530, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 786 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dispositional order was deficient because although the trial court addressed three of the factors set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2501ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2501(c)</a></cite>, it did not consider each
                        factor in that section; the form order specifically instructed the trial court to list any additional findings regarding the subsection (c) factors if they were not found elsewhere in the order or incorporated documents, and the
                        supplemental reports and assessments did not address these factors. In re I.W.P., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 254, 815 S.E.2d 696 (2018).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Findings Sufficient. - Sufficient factual findings were made in a dispositional order concerning appellant, a juvenile, because the trial court found, beyond a reasonable doubt, (1) crimes were premeditated and willful, (2) a sex crime was very serious,
                        (3) the juvenile denied charges and said sex offender treatment would not benefit the juvenile, and the juvenile had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, requiring a controlled environment, and (4) the juvenile's
                        family's proximity to and relationship with the victim's family made the juvenile's release too dangerous. In re G.C., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 750 S.E.2d 548 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Juvenile's dispositional order did not err for not considering statutory factors because (1) <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2512" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2512</a></cite> did not require findings on those factors, and (2)
                        the court considered the factors, as finding a robbery with a dangerous weapon adjudication showed the crime's seriousness was considered, findings of repeated probation violations showed a need to hold the juvenile accountable
                        was considered, findings of the juvenile's adjudication for armed robbery and school suspension for fighting showed public protection was considered, findings of how the juvenile violated probation showed degree of culpability
                        was considered, and finding the juvenile's failure to obtain treatment showed treatment needs were considered. In re D.E.P., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 752, 796 S.E.2d 509 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Purpose of Section and Amendment. - This section allows a trial court to commit a juvenile for the maximum period of time that any adult could be committed for the same offense, without considering prior record levels and aggravating/mitigating factors
                        as required under structured sentencing for adults; this interpretation is supported by the purpose of disposition in juvenile actions and the amendment effective December 1, 1996. In re Carter, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite>                        140, 479 S.E.2d 284 (1996).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Equal Protection Rights Not Violated. - There is a rational basis for the legislature's disparate treatment of adults and children, and, therefore, this section was not unconstitutionally applied to a juvenile in derogation of her equal protection rights,
                        notwithstanding that she was committed to the custody of the state for longer than the period for which an adult could have been imprisoned for her conduct, i.e., unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. In re Allison,
                        <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 547 S.E.2d 169 (2001).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Detailed Findings Required. - The trial judge must recite detailed findings in support of either test enunciated under this section, and those enumerated findings must be supported by some evidence in the record of the dispositional hearing. In re Khork,
                        <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 321 S.E.2d 487 (1984).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Findings Must Be Supported by Evidence in Hearing Record. - The essential element in the commitment order is not that it recites detailed findings beyond the two tests enumerated in this section, but that those enumerated findings are supported by some
                        evidence in the record of the dispositional hearing. In re Lail, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 238, 284 S.E.2d 731 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Effect of Lack of Evidence to Support Findings. - Where judge held no dispositional hearing, and denied juvenile the opportunity to present evidence as to disposition, and there was no evidence to support the findings made by the judge with respect to
                        disposition, the commitment order would be reversed so that the court could conduct a dispositional hearing. In re Lail, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 238, 284 S.E.2d 731 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consecutive commitments are not contrary to the philosophy of the Juvenile Code. Such reasoning would mean that once a juvenile had been committed to a detention facility or training school (now youth development center) he would be free to commit whatever
                        other illegal acts he so chose, knowing that he could not receive any additional punishment for his action. This was not the intention of the legislature when it adopted the Juvenile Code. In re Thompson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 666</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 499 (1985).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Juvenile Code does not contain any provision which prohibits the commitment of a juvenile to consecutive terms of detention. Absent an express prohibition, the common-law rule that the courts have the authority to commit offenders to consecutive terms
                        of confinement is controlling. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 666</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 499 (1985).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recommittal After Revocation of Conditional Release. - When a juvenile judge revokes a conditional release, the previous order provides authority for recommittal to the Division of Youth Services; no new order with the findings required by this section
                        is necessary. In re Baxley, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 328 S.E.2d 831, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 330</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 483 (1985).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inadequate Exploration of Alternatives to Commitment. - Judge had affirmative obligation to inquire into and to seriously consider merits of alternative dispositions; therefore, his failure to do so was error, even though court counselor failed to inform
                        judge of any programs that might be appropriate for child. Judge did not consider any of the broad range of community-level alternatives (except probation) listed in former G.S. 7A-647, 7A-648, or 7A-649 of the Juvenile Code, and
                        although child's attorney offered several examples of appropriate alternative programs, judge apparently failed to entertain these, simply accepting as dispositive court counselor's statement that drug rehabilitation program was
                        available. In re Groves, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 376 S.E.2d 481 (1989).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where the court counselor merely stated that a juvenile "probably" would not be accepted into alternative placements, the evidence did not support a finding that other alternatives were explored as required by former section before the juvenile was committed
                        to the Division of Youth Services. In re Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 122, 510 S.E.2d 190 (1999).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Parent's Inability to Pay for Treatment Did Not Amount to "Attempt." - Inability of child's mother to pay for drug treatment did not amount to an attempt at drug rehabilitation; determination of what disposition is appropriate for a given juvenile cannot
                        be predicated on the parent's ability, or inability, to pay. In re Groves, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 376 S.E.2d 481 (1989).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Commitment Within Discretion of Court. - It is within the discretion of the trial court to commit a juvenile to the Division of Youth Services, and there is no requirement that a recommendation for training school (now youth development center) be made
                        before a commitment is ordered. In re Molina, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 373, 511 S.E.2d 679 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Commitment to training school (now youth development center) was inappropriate where trial judge found that child was threat to himself, not to others, and where two shoplifting incidents comprised the only threat child posed to property of citizens of
                        community. In re Groves, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 376 S.E.2d 481 (1989).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fact that juvenile ran away from placements outside her home was not itself evidence of a "threat to persons or property in the community." In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, standing alone, was insufficient to support a finding that juvenile was a threat to persons or property. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reasonable and Available Nonstatutory Alternatives. - Prior to committing a juvenile to the Division of Youth Services, the court must also consider any reasonable and available nonstatutory community-level alternatives. In re Mosser,
                        <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 393 S.E.2d 308 (1990).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seriousness of Offense Cannot Be Sole Basis for Commitment. - A juvenile may not be committed to training school (now youth development center) based upon the perceived seriousness of the offense alone. In re Randall, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite>                        356, 393 S.E.2d 121 (1990), citing In re Khork, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 321 S.E.2d 487 (1984).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Commitment Warranted. - Where juvenile was initially placed on probation as an "undisciplined" child for unlawful absence from school, and his probation was continued when he was adjudicated a delinquent for damage to property by shooting out the windows
                        and screens of a home with an air rifle and again when he was adjudicated a delinquent for stealing $60.00 from a purse, his probationary status resulted from delinquent behavior rather than merely from the undisciplined behavior
                        upon which it was initially grounded, and the juvenile court had authority to commit him to the custody of the Division of Youth Services for placement in one of its residential facilities upon finding him in violation of the conditions
                        of his probation subsequent to the adjudications that he was delinquent. In re Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 273 S.E.2d 324 (1981).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Court exhausted all alternatives and properly committed a juvenile to training school (now youth development center) after the juvenile violated conditions of probation for second degree rape and taking indecent liberties with a child. In re Molina,
                        <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 373, 511 S.E.2d 679 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maximum Period Permitted. - Trial court did not err in sentencing defendant, a juvenile, to just under 24 months for breaking and entering a motor vehicle, as trial court could commit defendant for the maximum period of time that any adult could be committed
                        for the same offense, without considering prior record levels and aggravating/mitigating factors as required under structured sentencing for adults, and the maximum term for any adult was 24 months under

                    <p>
                        Findings Held Unsupported. - Findings of fact that alternatives to commitment as contained in former G.S. 7A-649 had been attempted unsuccessfully or were inappropriate and that juvenile's behavior constituted a threat to persons or property in the community,
                        made under subsection (a) of this section, held unsupported by the evidence. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Power to Order Sex Offender Treatment. - The district court had power to order the Department of Human Resources, Division of Youth Services to give sex offender treatment to an adolescent found delinquent because of sex offenses and subsequently to deny
                        the conditional release of that adolescent because treatment had not been in compliance with that mandate. In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 743</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 798 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Ordering Division of Youth Services to provide specific treatment for sexual offenders for a delinquent juvenile in its custody, when such treatment was available, was within the scope of the court's statutory authority. In re Doe,

                        The Division shall be responsible for evaluation of the progress of each juvenile at least once every six months as long as the juvenile remains in the care of the Division. Any determination that the juvenile should remain in the care of the Division
                        for an additional period of time shall be based on the Division's determination that the juvenile requires additional treatment or rehabilitation pursuant to G.S. 7B-2515. If the Division determines that a juvenile is ready for
                        release, the Division shall initiate a post-release supervision planning process. The post-release supervision planning process shall be defined by rules and regulations of the Division, but shall include the following:

                        Nature of Conditional Release. - A conditional release from the Division of Youth Services is not the same as probation or final discharge. A juvenile on conditional release is still technically subject to the original order committing him to the Division
                        of Youth Services, which is the basis of whatever restrictions on his activity might be deemed appropriate as aftercare supervision. In re Baxley, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 328 S.E.2d
                        831, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 330</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 483 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Recommittal After Revocation of Conditional Release. - When a juvenile judge revokes a conditional release, the previous order provides authority for recommittal to the Division of Youth Services; no new order with the findings required by former G.S.
                        7A-652 is necessary. In re Baxley, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 328 S.E.2d 831, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 330</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 483 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Denial of Conditional Release on Failure to Give Sex Offender Treatment. - The district court had power to order the Department of Human Resources, Division of Youth Services to give sex offender treatment to an adolescent found delinquent because of
                        sex offenses and subsequently to deny the conditional release of that adolescent because treatment had not been in compliance with that mandate. In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 743</cite>, 407
                        S.E.2d 798 (1991).

                        Construction. - In view of the fact that the relevant statutory language clearly and unambiguously requires that the notice of the proposed extension provided to the juvenile and his or her parents be in writing, it must be construed using its plain meaning;
                        since the notice provisions represent an attempt to address the same considerations that underlie fundamental due process protections, the notice provisions of are not construed as directory rather than mandatory. In re J.L.H.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 750 S.E.2d 197 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Comply With Notice Requirement. - Given that nothing in subsection (a) authorizes the courts to overlook the existence of deficient notice based on any failure on defendant juvenile's part to making a showing of actual prejudice, the court
                        of appeals lacked explicit statutory authority to absolve the State from the failure of the Division of Juvenile Justice to comply with the notice requirements. In re J.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite>                        214, 750 S.E.2d 197 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in denying defendant juvenile's motion to be released from commitment because the Division of Juvenile Justice failed to comply with the notice requirement, and the provision of adequate notice had a direct impact upon the ability of
                        defendant and his parents to contest the extension; no written notice of the final extension decision was provided to defendant or his father until the date upon which the Division officially approved the recommendation. In re
                        J.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 750 S.E.2d 197 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in denying defendant juvenile's motion to be released from commitment because the Division of Juvenile Justice failed to comply with the notice requirement; the fact that defendant juvenile's father received oral notice of the recommendation
                        that defendant's period of commitment would be extended did not provide any justification for a decision to overlook the Division's failure to provide written notice of the extension decision to the father in a timely manner. In
                        re J.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 750 S.E.2d 197 (2013).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Effect of Extension. - In view of the fact that a person subject to post-release supervision must comply with significant restrictions and the fact that any failure on a juvenile's part to comply with the conditions of post-release supervision can result
                        in his or her commitment to the custody of the Division of Juvenile Justice, the length of a particular juvenile's period of commitment has potential effects which extend well beyond the date upon which he or she is released from
                        the custody of the Division. In re J.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 750 S.E.2d 197 (2013).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appeal Not Moot. - Defendant juvenile's appeal of an order denying his motion to be released from commitment was not rendered moot by his release because a decision that defendant's period of commitment had been improperly extended would have a practical
                        impact on his life. In re J.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 750 S.E.2d 197 (2013).

                        Effect of Extension. - In view of the fact that a person subject to post-release supervision must comply with significant restrictions and the fact that any failure on a juvenile's part to comply with the conditions of post-release supervision can result
                        in his or her commitment to the custody of the Division of Juvenile Justice, the length of a particular juvenile's period of commitment has potential effects which extend well beyond the date upon which he or she is released from
                        the custody of the Division. In re J.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 750 S.E.2d 197 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Findings Sufficient to Support Revocation of Post-Release Supervision. - Findings that a juvenile defendant violated his release conditions based upon his failure to comply with the rules and regulations of his group home, and that the violations were
                        without just cause or legal dispute were sufficient to support the trial court's revocation of defendant's post-release supervision pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2516" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2516</a></cite>;
                        because a conditional release from the Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention was not the same as probation or final discharge, the requisite findings and conclusions contained in a dispositional order pursuant
                        to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2512" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2512</a></cite> were not applicable. Once defendant's post-release supervision was revoked, return to the Youth Development Center was mandated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2516" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2516</a></cite>(c).

                    <p>
                        Trial court's revocation of a juvenile's post-release supervision was proper, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba25s7B-2516" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2516</a></cite>, even though the trial court dismissed the case against
                        the juvenile for resisting a public officer, because the trial court found the juvenile missed school without an excuse and was suspended for the remainder of the school year, both of which were conditions of the juvenile's post-release
                        supervision. In re A.J. M.-B., <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 713 S.E.2d 104 (2011).

                        Finding of Changed Conditions Required. - It is fundamental that before an order may be entered modifying a custody decree, there must be a finding of fact of changed conditions. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                        53, 334 S.E.2d 428, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 194</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 584 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A decree of custody is entitled to such stability as would end the vicious litigation so often accompanying such contests, unless it be found that some change of circumstances has occurred affecting the welfare of the child so as to require modification
                        of the order. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 334 S.E.2d 428, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 194</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 584 (1986).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For case in which the court found no change in the needs of juvenile requiring that her custody be returned to her parents, see In re Botsford, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 72, 330 S.E.2d 23 (1985).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence of prior neglect which led to an adjudication of neglect shows circumstances as they were and therefore is relevant to whether a change of circumstances has occurred since the court's order. In re Brenner, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite>                        242, 350 S.E.2d 140 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Modification Upheld. - Where court had previously deemed it in the best interest of minor children who had been adjudicated neglected that mother comply with certain orders of the court, the court acted with full statutory authority when it later conducted
                        a hearing upon social worker's subsequent motion and determined that mother's refusal to cooperate with community-level services and orders applicable to her constituted a "change of circumstances" affecting the best interest of
                        the children, sufficient to require modification of prior custody orders. In re Brenner, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 350 S.E.2d 140 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court properly modified a juvenile's dispositional order because the court could not compel the provision of residential sex offender treatment in violation of federal law after having initially ordered the treatment based upon erroneous information,
                        and the facts constituted a change in circumstance under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba26s7B-2600ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2600(a)</a></cite>. In re D.G., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite>                        752, 663 S.E.2d 458 (2008), appeal dismissed, as moot, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 126</cite>, 674 S.E.2d 680 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Modification Erroneously Denied. - It was error to deny a juvenile's motion to modify the juvenile's disposition because the court wrongly assigned two delinquency history points for being on probation at the time of an offense when the juvenile was not
                        on probation, so the court had no authority to impose a level 3 disposition. In re A.F., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 752 S.E.2d 245 (2013).

                        This statute does not authorize an appeal following the adjudicatory portion of a juvenile case, only a final order. In re Pegram, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 527 S.E.2d 737 (2000).

                        Finding of Probable Cause Not Final Order. - A finding of probable cause in a juvenile proceeding was not an appealable "final order" under former G.S. 7A-666 [see now this section], and evidentiary rulings of the trial court in conducting the probable
                        cause hearing were not properly before the Court of Appeals for review. In re Ford, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 680, 272 S.E.2d 157 (1980).

                        A finding of probable cause in a juvenile proceeding did not fall within any of the four categories of final orders specified in former G.S. 7A-666 [see now this section] and, therefore, was not immediately appealable. In re K.R.B.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 328, 517 S.E.2d 200 (1999), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 188</cite>, 541 S.E.2d 713 (1999).

                        An adjudication of delinquency is not a final order. No appeal may be taken from such order unless no disposition is made within 60 days of the adjudication of delinquency. In re Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite>                        213, 290 S.E.2d 797 (1982).

                        No Trial Court Jurisdiction During Pendency of Appeal - In a juvenile delinquency proceeding, an amended adjudication order and a disposition order had to be vacated because both were entered during the pendency of the juvenile's appeal after no disposition
                        had been entered within 60 days of the adjudication of the juvenile as delinquent. In re Rikard, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 587 S.E.2d 467 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appellate court was required to vacate and remand a dispositional order in a juvenile delinquency case because the trial court lacked jurisdiction; the trial court entered its adjudication order on May 14, 2013, no disposition was made within 60 days,
                        and appellant, a juvenile, filed notice of appeal from the adjudication order on July 15, 2013. The trial court later held a disposition hearing on January 23, 2014. In re J.F., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite>                        218, 766 S.E.2d 341 (2014).

                        and because no appealable final order had yet been entered in the case, certiorari was granted to consider the arguments raised by the juvenile regarding his adjudication of delinquency. In re J.V.J., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite>                        737, 707 S.E.2d 636 (2011).

                    <p>
                        As a result of the fact that the date upon which the orders that the juvenile sought to challenge on appeal were entered was unclear, the juvenile might have lost his right to seek appellate review of the orders in question through no fault of his own;
                        as a result, in the exercise of its discretion, the appellate court granted the juvenile's certiorari petition and considered his challenges to the trial court's orders on the merits. In re Z.T.W.,

                        Oral Notice of Appeal from Final Order. - When the second sentence of this section permitting oral notice of appeal at the hearing, is read in conjunction with the first sentence providing for appellate review only upon any "final order," it appears that
                        oral notice of appeal given at the time of the hearing must be from a final order. In re Hawkins, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 463 S.E.2d 268 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Oral Notice of Appeal from Order That Was Not Final. - In a case in which a juvenile appealed an order by a district court, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction because the juvenile's notice of appeal, given in open court prior to the entry of the
                        juvenile court's final written order, was not a timely notice of appeal. In re D.K.L., <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 689 S.E.2d 508 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Appeal from Final Order of Disposition. - Although a trial court dismissed a juvenile's case of resisting a public officer, the adjudication order was not dismissed and the juvenile's appeal of the final order of disposition, pursuant to
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba26s7B-2602" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2602</a></cite>, was properly before the appellate court. In re A.J. M.-B., <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 713 S.E.2d 104 (2011).

                        Failure To Note Appeals In Timely Manner. - Court of appeals refrained from discussing certain details surrounding the history of defendant's juvenile's involvement in the juvenile justice system and the facts and circumstances surrounding the entry of
                        the earlier orders that had been challenged in his brief because none of the issues were properly before it; defendant failed to note appeals from the orders in a timely manner.

                        Notwithstanding G.S. 7B-2602, any order transferring jurisdiction of the district court in a juvenile matter to the superior court may be appealed to the superior court for a hearing on the record. Notice of the appeal must be given in open court or in
                        writing within 10 days after entry of the order of transfer in district court.  Entry of an order shall be treated in the same manner as entry of a judgment under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 58 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
                        The clerk of superior court shall provide the district attorney with a copy of any written notice of appeal filed by the attorney for the juvenile. Upon expiration of the 10 day period in which an appeal may be entered, if an appeal
                        has been entered and not withdrawn, the clerk shall transfer the case to the superior court docket. The superior court shall, within a reasonable time, review the record of the transfer hearing for abuse of discretion by the juvenile
                        court in the issue of transfer. The superior court shall not review the findings as to probable cause for the underlying offense.

                        adjudication and the juvenile has been granted pretrial release provided in G.S 15A-533 and G.S. 15A-534, the obligor shall be released from the juvenile's bond upon the district court's review of whether the juvenile shall be

                        This section authorizes an immediate direct appeal to the Court of Appeals of a juvenile transfer order. State v. T.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 495 S.E.2d 700 (1998).

                        Finding of Probable Cause Not Final Order. - A finding of probable cause in a juvenile proceeding was not an appealable "final order" under former G.S. 7A-666 (see now this section), and evidentiary rulings of the trial court in conducting the probable
                        cause hearing were not properly before the Court of Appeals for review. In re Ford, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 680, 272 S.E.2d 157 (1980).

                        An adjudication of delinquency is not a final order. No appeal may be taken from such order unless no disposition is made within 60 days of the adjudication of delinquency.

                        Remand of Case Inappropriate. - Superior court erred in finding that a district court abused the court's discretion in transferring a juvenile's case to the superior court because the superior court failed to properly apply the abuse of discretion standard
                        of review and effectively engaged in a de novo review by making findings on the evidence relating to the factors set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba22s7B-2203ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2203(b)</a></cite>;
                        the superior court did not explain in what way the district court's decision was manifestly unreasonable but simply concluded, based on the court's de novo view of the evidence, that transfer was inappropriate. In re E.S.,

                        County May Not Appeal. - It is manifest that this statute (former G.S. 7A-667) does not empower a county to take an appeal in a juvenile proceeding. In re Brownlee, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 532</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 861 (1981),

                <p>
                    Pending disposition of an appeal, the release of the juvenile, with or without conditions, should issue in every case unless the court orders otherwise. For compelling reasons which must be stated in writing, the court may enter a temporary order affecting
                    the custody or placement of the juvenile as the court finds to be in the best interests of the juvenile or the State.

                        Constitutionality of Former G.S. 7A-289. - Former G.S. 7A-289, permitting the district court to enter a temporary custody order affecting a juvenile who is appealing a commitment order of the court, was not unconstitutional on the ground that the statute
                        deprived the juvenile of the right to bail. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 176 S.E.2d 849 (1970), decided under former G.S. 7A-289.

                        Section Controls over G.S. 1-294. - Although <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-294" target="_blank">G.S. 1-294</a></cite> states the general rule regarding jurisdiction of the trial court pending
                        appeal, it is not controlling where there is a specific statute, such as former G.S. 7A-669 (see now this section), addressing the matter in question. In re Huber, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 291 S.E.2d 916,
                        appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 223 (1982).

                        Trial Courts Divested of Jurisdiction During Pendency of Appeal - In a juvenile delinquency proceeding, an amended adjudication order and a disposition order had to be vacated because both were entered during the pendency of the juvenile's appeal after
                        no disposition had been entered within 60 days of the adjudication of the juvenile as delinquent. In re Rikard, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 587 S.E.2d 467 (2003).

                        Section Permits Court to Circumvent Recalcitrant Parties. - Without authority of the district court to provide for the treatment of a neglected child pending appeal, a recalcitrant party could frustrate the efforts of the court to provide for the child's
                        best interests by simply entering notice of appeal. In re Huber, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 291 S.E.2d 916, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>,

                        Commitment Held Proper. - Temporary order, which also ordered respondent juvenile to remain in custody of the Department of Social Services and to be placed in a residential treatment facility for ninety days for evaluation purposes, was authorized pursuant

                    <p>
                        Commitment Held Improper - Trial court erred by denying a juvenile's release while his appeal was pending in part because he refused to admit committing the offenses for which he was adjudicated delinquent, as compelling such an admission to win release
                        violated the juvenile's self-incrimination privilege under the state and federal constitutions. In re Lineberry, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 572 S.E.2d 229 (2002).

                        Emergency Commitment Held Improper. - Written order which merely stated that it was an "emergency commitment," without stating any supporting reasons or findings of fact, was not proper. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                        171, 365 S.E.2d 642 (1988), holding, however, that juvenile had not shown prejudice from such order.

                    <p>
                        Denial of juvenile defendant's motion for release pending appeal was not improper, given that defendant did not challenge the trial court's findings of fact supporting its reason for denying defendant's motion, which was that he committed first degree
                        sex offenses with a child. In re J.J.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 777, 659 S.E.2d 757 (2008).

                        Failure to State Reasons Why Juvenile Could Not Be Released Pending Appeal. - Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba26s7B-2605" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2605</a></cite>, defendant juvenile should have been released because the trial
                        court failed to state any compelling reasons in writing why defendant could not be released pending his appeal. In re J.J., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 717 S.E.2d 59 (2011).

                        Support payments ordered pursuant to former G.S. 7A-650(c) should be based on the interplay of the trial court's conclusions as to the amount of support necessary to meet the needs of the child and the ability of the parents to provide that amount. The
                        court's conclusions should in turn be based on findings of fact sufficiently specific to show that the court gave due regard to the relevant factors in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.4ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.4(c)</a></cite>                        and any other relevant factors of the particular case. When such findings are not made, the order should be vacated, because appellate courts have no means of determining whether the order is supported by the evidence and is based

                        Juvenile Has Right to Examine Department of Social Services Files and Mental Health Records. - Trial court abused its discretion by denying a juvenile the right to examine his records under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba29s7B-2901ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2901(b)</a></cite>                        because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba29s7B-2901ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2901(b)</a></cite> gave the juvenile the right to examine his county department of social services files and mental health records; the trial court
                        deemed which portions of the juvenile's record were irrelevant or cumulative and ordered those portions sealed. In re J.L., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 605, 685 S.E.2d 11 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. - For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if
                        committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-287.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-287.

                    <p>
                        Motion to Continue Improperly Denied. - Trial court abused its discretion by denying a juvenile's motion to continue the disposition because the juvenile had a right under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba29s7B-2901ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 7B-2901(b)</a></cite>                        to access additional records, and the trial court should have granted the motion to continue in order to give the juvenile an opportunity to gather evidence for his disposition hearing. In re J.L., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite>                        605, 685 S.E.2d 11 (2009).

                        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. - For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if
                        committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-287.

                    <p>
                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-287.

                        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. - For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if
                        committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-287.

                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-287.

                        neglect, or dependency or the provision or arrangement of protective services in a child abuse, neglect, or dependency case by a local department of social services pursuant to the authority granted under Chapter 7B of the General
                        Statutes or to any case in which a petition is filed alleging that a juvenile is abused, neglected, dependent, undisciplined, or delinquent and shall continue to do so until the protective services case is closed by the local department
                        of social services, or if a petition is filed when the juvenile is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of juvenile court. Agencies that may be designated as "agencies authorized to share information" include local mental health
                        facilities, local health departments, local departments of social services, local law enforcement agencies, local school administrative units, the district's district attorney's office, the Juvenile Justice Section of the Division
                        of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety, and the Office of Guardian ad Litem Services of the Administrative Office of the Courts, and, pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 7B-3000(e1), the Section
                        of Community Corrections of the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety. Any information shared among agencies pursuant to this section shall remain confidential, shall be withheld from
                        public inspection, and shall be used only for the protection of the juvenile and others or to improve the educational opportunities of the juvenile, and shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Family Educational
                        and Privacy Rights Act as set forth in 20 U.S.C. § 1232g. Nothing in this section or any other provision of law shall preclude any other necessary sharing of information among agencies. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require
                        the disclosure or release of any information in the possession of a district attorney.

                        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. - For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if
                        committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-287.

                    <p>
                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-287.

                        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. - For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if
                        committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-287.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729 (1972), decided under former G.S. 7A-287.

                        Cross-Examination About Prior Juvenile Proceedings. - Former G.S. 7A-677(b) is in line with the general rule that a defendant who takes the stand may be cross-examined for impeachment purposes about prior convictions. State v. Baker,
                        <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 34</cite>, 320 S.E.2d 670 (1984).

                    <p>
                        The prosecutor's tactic of reading from defendant's juvenile petitions while cross-examining defendant is not to be commended, but it does not constitute prejudicial error. When a prosecutor is acting on a good faith belief in the reliability of his information,
                        he may press or "sift" the witness by further cross-examination when the witness denies that he committed the crimes or bad acts that are the subject of the cross-examination. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 34</cite>,
                        320 S.E.2d 670 (1984).

                    <p>
                        A prosecutor may not, in cross-examining a defendant on collateral crimes, use questions which assume as facts unproved insinuations of the defendant's guilt of collateral offenses. However, prosecutor was not making insinuations of unproven facts where
                        he based his questions concerning defendant's prior convictions on juvenile petitions from proceedings in which defendant had been found to be delinquent. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 34</cite>,

                    The provisions of this Article may be enforced by the parent, guardian, custodian, or person who has assumed the status and obligation of a parent without being awarded legal custody of the juvenile by a court to the juvenile by filing a civil action
                    in the district court of the county where the juvenile can be found or the county of the plaintiff's residence. Upon the institution of such action by a verified complaint, alleging that the defendant juvenile has left home or has
                    left the place where the juvenile has been residing and refuses to return and comply with the direction and control of the plaintiff, the court may issue an order directing the juvenile personally to appear before the court at a specified
                    time to be heard in answer to the allegations of the plaintiff and to comply with further orders of the court. Such orders shall be served by the sheriff upon the juvenile and upon any other person named as a party defendant in such
                    action. At the time of the issuance of the order directing the juvenile to appear, the court may in the same order, or by separate order, order the sheriff to enter any house, building, structure, or conveyance for the purpose of searching
                    for the juvenile and serving the order and for the purpose of taking custody of the person of the juvenile in order to bring the juvenile before the court. Any order issued at said hearing shall be treated as a mandatory injunction
                    and shall remain in full force and effect until the juvenile reaches the age of 18, or until further orders of the court. Within 30 days after the hearing on the original order, the juvenile, or anyone acting in the juvenile's behalf,
                    may file a verified answer to the complaint. Upon the filing of an answer by or on behalf of the juvenile, any district court judge holding court in the county or district court district as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIVa13s7A-133" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-133</a></cite>                    where the action was instituted shall have jurisdiction to hear the matter, without a jury, and to make findings of fact, conclusions of law, and render judgment thereon. Appeals from the district court to the Court of Appeals shall
                    be allowed as in civil actions generally. The district court issuing the original order or the district court hearing the matter after answer has been filed shall also have authority to order that any person named defendant in the
                    order or judgment shall not harbor, keep, or allow the defendant juvenile to remain on the person's premises or in the person's home. Failure of any defendant to comply with the terms of said order or judgment shall be punishable as
                    for contempt.

        Emancipation Decree Required.
       </b> - In a question of first impression, the appellate court held that, when the child of divorced parents left the custodial parent's home to live on his own, but was not decreed by a court to be legally emancipated, the
                        non-custodial parent's obligation to pay child support did not automatically terminate, because Article 35 of the Juvenile Code precluded the appellate court from accepting common law methods of emancipation for the purposes of
                        terminating child support payments; thus, the father's child support obligations could not have automatically terminated absent a decree of emancipation. Morris v. Powell, - N.C. App. - , 840 S.E.2d 223 (2020).

                        Trial court did not err in not holding the father in contempt as he did not intend to willfully violate the child support order because he was under the mistaken apprehension that he could simply stop paying after his son ceased living with the mother.

                        Placing Children with Grandparents Was Not Placement for Purposes of Compact. - Trial court's actions in finding that children were neglected and dependent and placing them in the guardianship of their maternal grandparents did not constitute placement
                        mandating compliance with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba38s7B-3800" target="_self">G.S. 7B-3800</a></cite>, because it was not in foster care or as

                        "Sending Agency" - Natural Parents. - Because defendants, a child's natural parents, were persons who sent the child to North Carolina for possible adoption by plaintiffs, they were the "sending agency" as that term is used in Article II(b) of the Compact,
                        and as such, pursuant to Article V, they retained jurisdiction, that is, authority or control over the child until his adoption, including the power to effect or cause the return of the child to their home state and "to determine
                        all matters in relation to the custody" of the child; therefore, the trial court properly determined that it had no jurisdiction over a custody proceeding brought by potential adoptive parents. Stancil v. Brock,

                        Placement With Relatives. - When, in a dependency proceeding, a trial court placed a child's custody with the child's foster parents without finding it was contrary to the child's best interests to place her with willing relatives, pursuant to
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba09s7B-903ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 7B-903(a)(2)</a></cite>c, this was error because, inter alia, exempting review hearings from the requirement to first consider placement with relatives risked
                        undermining the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), <cite class="octn"><a href="#t7Ba38s7B-3800" target="_self">G.S. 7B-3800</a></cite>, as home studies of out-of-state relatives required by the ICPC were often
                        not completed until a review hearing was held. In re L.L., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 689, 616 S.E.2d 392 (2005).

                        order that placed a juvenile with her maternal great-grandmother in South Carolina, despite the lack of approval of the great-grandmother's home by South Carolina authorities, violated the Interstate Compact on the Placement of

                        Because the county department of human services (DHS) had not received notification of the proposed placement of the children from the appropriate Arizona agency prior to entry of the permanency planning order their aunt and uncle in Arizona, the trial
                        court was not authorized to award custody of the children to their aunt and uncle in Arizona; the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children required that Arizona notify DHS the proposed placement of the children did not appear

                    dated September 29, 2008, the Secretary of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention notified the Revisor of Statutes that the Interstate Compact for Juveniles has become effective under the terms of the Compact because 35 states
                    have now adopted it. Illinois became the 35th state when the Governor signed the legislation adopting the Compact in Illinois on August 26, 2008.

                        from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from

                        and mutual assistance in the prevention  of crime.
