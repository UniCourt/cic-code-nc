                        Purpose. - The Commission must establish a debt set-off program by which lottery prize payments may be used to satisfy a debt owed or collected by a claimant agency that is at least fifty dollars ($50.00). The collection remedy under this section is in
                        addition to and not in substitution for any other remedy available by law.

                        Notification. - A claimant agency is automatically enrolled in the Commission's debt set-off program if it is enrolled in the Department of Revenue debt set-off program. To provide for more efficient operations, the Department of Revenue shall provide
                        to the Commission on a periodic basis all updates to its debt set-off program as soon as practicable.

                        Setoff. - The Commission must match the information submitted by the claimant agency with persons who are entitled to a State lottery prize payment in an amount of six hundred dollars ($600.00) or more. If there is a match, the Commission must set off
                        the debt against the lottery winnings to which the debtor would otherwise be entitled. When there are multiple claims to be set off, the priority in claims to set off is the same as provided in G.S. 105A-12. The winnings that exceed
                        the amount of the debt, if any, must be paid to that person. The Commission must mail the debtor written notice that the setoff has occurred and must transfer the net proceeds collected to the claimant agency. If the claimant agency
                        is a State agency, that agency must credit the amount received to a nonreverting trust account and must follow the procedure set in G.S. 105A-8.

                        Collection Assistance Fee. - To recover the costs incurred by the Commission in collecting debts under this section, a collection assistance fee of five dollars ($5.00) may be imposed on each debt collected through setoff. The Commission must collect
                        this fee as part of the debt and retain it. To recover the costs incurred by local agencies in submitting debts for collection under this section, a collection assistance fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) may be imposed on each local
                        agency debt collected through setoff. The Commission must collect this fee as part of the debt and remit it to the clearinghouse that submitted the debt. The collection assistance fees do not apply to child support debts. If the
                        Commission is able to collect only part of a debt through setoff, the Commission's collection assistance fee has priority over the local collection assistance fee and over the remainder of the debt. The local collection assistance

                        State's lottery law was not a revenue bill and, thus, its provisions such as G.S. 18-164(a) allowing for net revenues to be transferred periodically to the Education Lottery Fund, were not enacted in violation of the requirements set forth in N.C. Const.,

   </span> 23. The law did not: (1) raise money on the credit of the State; (2) pledge the faith of the State directly or indirectly for the payment of any debt; or (3) impose any tax upon the people of the State, but, rather,
                        allowed citizens to participate in a voluntary activity that incidentally raised revenue. Heatherly v. State, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 213, 658 S.E.2d 11 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 115</cite>,

                        Privilege Tax on Cyber-Gambling Establishments Was Constitutional. - City's privilege license tax on cyber-gambling establishments was not invalid because it exempted state-endorsed lotteries from taxation, as the state-endorsed lotteries provided net
                        revenues to the State Education Lottery Fund and thus reasonably constituted a separate classification from unendorsed gambling. IMT, Inc. v. City of Lumberton, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite>                        36, 724 S.E.2d 588 (2012).
