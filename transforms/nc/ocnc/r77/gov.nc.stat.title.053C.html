                        Suit upon Refusal to Issue Charter. - Where plaintiffs applied for an industrial bank charter, and their application was not passed upon by the Secretary of State on the advice and recommendation of the Commissioner of Banks, acting in accordance with
                        G.S. 53-4, and plaintiffs sued to compel the issuance of a charter, alleging no capricious acts, bad faith or disregard of law by the State officers, the complaint did not state a cause of action and was not sufficient as a petition
                        for certiorari or as an application for mandamus. Pue v. Hood, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 310</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 896 (1942).

                        Scope of Duty and Discretion of Commissioner. - The duty imposed upon and the discretion vested in the Commissioner of Banks under this section bears only upon the question whether certain conditions exist justifying the creation of the proposed bank
                        under the terms and procedure laid down in the statute. His action and the certificate issued thereon merely constitute the prescribed procedure to determine whether the franchise applied for was grantable under the law. Pue v.

                        Basis for Refusal to Issue Certificate. - If the certificate of incorporation complies with statutory requirements in all other respects, the authority of the Commissioner of Banks to refuse to issue such certificate to the Secretary of State must be
                        based on a finding adverse to the proposed banking corporation in respect of one or more of the legislative standards defined in this section. Young v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 9</cite>, 112

                        Review by State Banking Commission. - Any decision made by the Commissioner of Banks in the exercise of the responsibility and authority conferred upon him by this section is subject to review by the State Banking Commission upon application by any adversely
                        affected interested person. Young v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 9</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 758 (1960).

                    <p>
                        Upon review of a decision of the Commissioner of Banks, the Commission has no authority to direct the Commissioner of Banks to refuse to issue a certificate of approval to a proposed banking corporation which is otherwise in compliance with statutory
                        requirements, except on a finding adverse to the proposed banking corporation in respect of one or more of the legislative standards defined in this section. Young v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 9</cite>,

                        Six-month limitation set out in the last sentence of this section applies only in the event the "said persons" have become "a body politic and corporate" and the certificate of incorporation has been recorded and issued. Young v. Roberts,

                        Only State May Take Advantage of Defect in Organization. - A defect in the organization of a bank because of failure to begin business within the specified time can be taken advantage of only by a direct proceeding by the State for that purpose. Boyd

                        Section Enters into and Forms Part of Bond. - The provision of this section requiring officers and employees of a bank to give bond in an amount required by the directors and upon such form as may be approved by the Commissioner of Banks, is the only
                        statutory provision which becomes a part of the bond. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Hood, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 706</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 198 (1946). See Hood v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 748</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Effect of Renewal of Bond. - When a bond, which guarantees the fidelity of a bank cashier and guarantees the bank against loss by reason of embezzlement, etc., of said cashier, is executed for an indefinite term and thereafter is kept in force by the
                        payment of annual premiums, for each year the officer was reelected, then each and every renewal thereof is a separate and distinct bond or independent contract. Hood v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 748</cite>,
                        175 S.E. 193 (1934).

                    <p>
                        Where a bond guaranteeing the payment of any loss sustained through the dishonesty of a bank official, while "in the continuous employment of a bank" after a specified date, is kept in force for a period of years by the payment of the stipulated annual
                        premium, recovery on the bond is limited to the maximum liability, therein stipulated for losses, occurring during the life of the bond, and the contention that the surety is liable for defalcations to the amount of the penal sum
                        of the bond for each of the years during which the bond is kept in force, is untenable. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Hood, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 706</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 198 (1946), distinguishing
                        Hood v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 748</cite>, 175 S.E. 193 (1934).

                        Fidelity bond interpretation. - Because, under an ambiguous termination clause couched in the present tense in a fidelity bond, as interpreted, coverage only terminated when the insured bank initially discovered, after the coverage period's commencement,
                        an employee's dishonest conduct, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the bank on its claim arising out of the embezzlement of over $1,000,000 from an account of a customer of the bank by an assistant vice president,
                        whom the bank knew had been previously convicted of embezzlement. Home Sav. Bank v. Colonial Am. Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 189, 598 S.E.2d 265 (2004), cert. dismissed,

                        Editor's Note. -

                        <span class="s3">

     The cases cited below were decided under former Article 8 (G.S. 53-92 et seq.) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.053.html" target="_blank">Chapter 53</a></cite> and prior law.
     <br />

</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Purpose. - The wisdom of this section and G.S. 53-48 [now repealed] is manifest; banks, whose business is conducted in strict compliance therewith seldom become insolvent. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 528</cite>,
                        130 S.E. 180 (1925).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Criminal Liability of Bank's Officers. - A bank must act through its officers, and where they have violated the provisions of this section and G.S. 53-48 [now repealed], as to lending the bank's money, the offense is committed by the officers under the
                        meaning of the statute, and they are individually indictable therefor. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 528</cite>, 130 S.E. 180 (1925).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Showing of Knowledge of Violation Is Sufficient for Conviction. - Where the official position of an officer of a bank is such as necessarily to acquaint him of the violation of the statute respecting the making of loans, and to fix him as a party thereto,
                        it is sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of the misdemeanor prescribed by G.S. 53-134 [now repealed]. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 528</cite>, 130 S.E. 180 (1925).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Intent Not Element of Offense. - An intent to defraud the bank or others is not required to be either alleged in the indictment or proved upon the trial of the issue raised by a plea of not guilty. Neither the bank nor any of its officers or directors
                        have any discretion as to the making of loans which are thus forbidden. Intent is, therefore, not an element of the crime. The willful doing of the unlawful act constitutes the crime declared by G.S. 53-134 [now repealed] to be
                        a misdemeanor. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 528</cite>, 130 S.E. 180 (1925).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consolidation of Indictments. - An indictment charging a bank officer of violating this section and also unlawfully making loans in violation of G.S. 53-48 [now repealed] alleges the commission of crimes of the same class. Where there are two indictments
                        thereof against the same person they may be consolidated and tried together by the court. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 528</cite>, 130 S.E. 180 (1925).

                    <p>
                        Purpose. - The wisdom of this section and G.S. 53-111 [now repealed] is manifest; banks whose business is conducted in strict compliance therewith seldom become insolvent. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 528</cite>,
                        130 S.E. 180 (1925).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section Not Retroactive. - The statutory limitation upon a bank making loans to any one person or class of common interest does not apply to loans, or extensions or renewals thereof, existing at the date of the ratification of this section. State v. Cooper,
                        <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 528</cite>, 130 S.E. 180 (1925).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Loss of Assets Must Be Shown in Action for Violation of Section. - In an action against the managing officials of a bank for wrongful depletion of assets in mismanagement of the affairs of the bank in making loans in excess of the limit set forth in this
                        section, the evidence is insufficient to be submitted to a jury, if it appears that no loss to the assets of the bank has been caused by the acts of the officials. Gordon v. Pendleton, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 241</cite>,
                        162 S.E. 546 (1932).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Liability of Bank's Officers. - A bank must act through its officers and directors, and where they have violated the provisions of this section as to lending the bank's money, the offense is committed by them under the meaning of the statute, and they
                        are individually indictable therefor. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 528</cite>, 130 S.E. 180 (1925); State v. Davidson, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 735</cite>, 172 S.E. 489 (1934).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Showing of Knowledge of Violation Is Sufficient for Conviction. - Where the official position of an officer of a bank is such as necessarily to acquaint him of the violation of the statute respecting the making of loans, and to fix him as a party thereto,
                        it is sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of the misdemeanor prescribed by G.S. 53-134 [now repealed]. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 528</cite>, 130 S.E. 180 (1925).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Intent to Defraud Not Element of Offense. - An intent to defraud the bank or others is not required to be either alleged in the indictment or proved upon the trial of the issue raised by a plea of not guilty. Neither the bank nor any of its officers or
                        directors have any discretion as to the making of loans which are thus forbidden. Intent is, therefore, not an element of the crime. The willful doing of the unlawful act constitutes the crime declared by G.S. 53-134 [now repealed]
                        to be a misdemeanor. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 528</cite>, 130 S.E. 180 (1925).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Consolidation of Indictments under This Section and G.S. 53-111 [now repealed]. - An indictment charging the officer of the bank of violating G.S. 53-111, and also unlawfully making loans for the bank to certain persons in excess of the maximum percentage
                        of the capital stock and permanent surplus, in violation of this section, alleges the commission of crimes of the same class. Where there are two indictments thereof against the same person they may be consolidated and tried together

                            an account the principal held jointly with the attorney-in-fact and then transferring the funds to the attorney-in-fact because (1) the transfer to the account the principal held jointly with the attorney-in-fact carried out

                        Attachment of Funds in Trust for Minor. - Funds deposited in a trust established under this section by a judgment debtor for the benefit of his minor son were subject to attachment by judgment creditors, since the trust was revocable and the debtor could
                        freely withdraw funds from it. Jimenez v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 818, 509 S.E.2d 241 (1998).

                        Order for Widow to Repay Funds Proper. - Since a transfer of funds from a decedent's payable on death account by his widow took place while the deceased was still alive, the widow had no ownership interest in the funds in the account at the time that
                        she transferred the funds, and partial summary judgment that the widow repay the money was proper. Estate of Redden v. Redden, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 632 S.E.2d 794 (2006).

                        Consolidated Bank Succeeds to Power as Trustee Under Deed of Trust. - A bank, created as a result of a consolidation of several State banks, may properly exercise the power of sale contained in a deed of trust in which one of its constituent banks was
                        named trustee, upon default by the trustor, since under this section the consolidated bank succeeds to such power. Braak v. Hobbs, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 379</cite>, 186 S.E. 500 (1936).

                        Successor by Merger. - Petitioner was the holder of a note as it had physical possession of the note at the hearing and submitted a copy of that note, and a Non-Home Loan Certificate that stated that petitioner was successor by merger to the mortgagee
                        was not challenged; because of the merger, petitioner had all the rights and powers the mortgagee had before the merger under G.S. 53-17 [now repealed]. As the mortgagee was the indorser of the note in blank, petitioner received
                        those rights in the merger. In re Yopp, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 720 S.E.2d 769 (2011).

                        Approval of Stockholders Not Necessary for Sale of Assets. - For a valid sale of assets to another bank the approval of the stockholders of the selling bank is not required by this section, and the section is not invalid for that reason. Planters' Sav.

                        "Insolvent" Defined. - The word "insolvent," in this section, means when the bank cannot meet its depository liabilities in due course, and does not require that the condition of the bank should at the time be such as to enable it at any given time to
                        pay all of its depositors in full at the time on demand. State v. Hightower, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 300</cite>, 121 S.E. 616 (1924).

                        "Knowledge" Defined. - The word "knowledge," as used in the statute, is to be taken in its ordinary sense and according to its usual significance or acceptation. It means an impression of the mind, the state of being aware; and this may be acquired in
                        numerous ways and from many sources. It is usually obtained from a variety of facts and circumstances. Generally speaking, when it is said a person has knowledge of a given condition, it is meant that his relation to it, his association
                        with it, his control over it, and his direction of it are such as to give him actual information concerning it. State v. Hightower, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 300</cite>, 121 S.E. 616 (1924).

                        Who May Bring Action for Civil Liability. - A violation of this section by an employee, or by officers and directors of a bank, resulting in damages to a depositor, is a wrong to the depositor; he and not the bank or its receiver is entitled to maintain
                        an action to recover the damages resulting from such wrong. See Townsend v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 330</cite>, 23 S.E. 461 (1895); Tate v. Bates, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 287</cite>,

                        A depositor in a bank, who has sustained damages, peculiar to himself, by the wrongful act of the officers and directors of the bank, has a right to recover damages in an action brought by him against the officers and directors. Douglass v. Dawson,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">190 N.C. 458</cite>, 130 S.E. 195 (1925); Bane v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 387</cite>, 135 S.E. 118 (1926).

                        Liability Not Bank Asset. - Sums for which bank officers and directors are liable for receiving or permitting receipt of deposit with knowledge of bank's insolvency, contrary to this section, are not assets of the bank. The wrong being only to the depositor,
                        he need not allege, to maintain an action, that bank's receiver refused to sue on demand. Bane v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 387</cite>, 135 S.E. 118 (1926).

                        Elements of Offense. - In order for a conviction under the provisions of this section, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the actual receipt of the deposits by defendant officer of the bank at the time when the bank was insolvent to his own
                        knowledge, or that such officer permitted an employee of the bank to receive the deposits with knowledge of these facts. State v. Hightower, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 300</cite>, 121 S.E. 616 (1924).

                    <p>
                        Necessary Allegations. - In order for a depositor to maintain an action against the individual officers of an insolvent bank for permitting the deposits to be received it is necessary, among other things, to allege and prove the insolvency of the bank
                        at the time the deposits were made, and the allegation that is was either insolvent then or the misconduct of the officials afterwards caused its insolvency, is insufficient, the alternative of the allegation being a wrong to the
                        bank itself which may be sued upon by its receiver afterwards. Wall v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 310</cite>, 139 S.E. 449 (1927).

                        Evidence of Value of Assets and Property. - For the purpose of ascertaining the solvency or insolvency of a bank, it is permissible to go into an investigation of its assets and property as of the date when the deposit was made, and, of course, their
                        value after that, or at the time of the trial, is competent as illustrating or bearing upon their worth at the time the deposit was charged to have been received. State v. Hightower, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 300</cite>,

                        testimony. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 187</cite>, 162 S.E. 363 (1932).

                        Certified Accountant as Witness. - Upon the trial of a bank official under the provisions of this section, testimony of a certified public accountant who had had experience in such matters and who had examined the books of the bank and had obtained from
                        the directors, collectively and individually, information as to the value of its assets including lands and collateral, that the bank was insolvent at the time in question is not objectionable. State v. Brewer,

                        basis of their opinions thereon, it may not be decided as a matter of law, upon conflicting evidence, that the defendant must have known of the insolvent condition testified to by the experts. State v. Hightower,

                        sufficient which merely charges such falsification without showing that the false entries were material or affected the interests of the bank or deceived its officers. State v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 592</cite>,

                        sufficient if it alleges that some of the defendants were officers or employees of the bank and that the other defendants conspired with them to do the unlawful act. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 13</cite>,

                        defective for failing to particularize that it was a bank, within the contemplation of the statute under which the indictment had been drawn. State v. Hedgecock, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 714</cite>,

                        Sufficiency of Indictment. - In a prosecution under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIIa32s14-254" target="_blank">G.S. 14-254</a></cite> it was not necessary to aver or to prove that
                        the money or funds had been committed by the bank to the custody of the defendant or that there had been any breach of trust or confidence except that which arose out of the relation between the bank and the defendant. Nor was
                        it necessary to charge in the very words that the defendant had converted the property to his own use. The words "did embezzle" sufficiently indicated the criminal act. The intent to defraud was sufficiently set out, under
                        <cite

                            to indicate the number of abstractions, if more than one. State v. Maslin, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 537</cite>, 143 S.E. 3 (1928), overruled on other grounds, State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 663</cite>,

                        Variance as to Some Items. - In a prosecution of an officer of a bank for publishing a false report of the bank's condition in violation of this section, a variance between the allegations and proof as to some of the items of the report will not be fatal
                        when there is no variance with respect to all the items, it being sufficient for conviction if the report as published was false in any particular as alleged in the indictment and was published with knowledge of such falsity and
                        with a wrongful or unlawful intent. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 47</cite>, 164 S.E. 732, cert. denied, 287 U.S. 645, 53 S. Ct. 91, 77 L. Ed. 558 (1932).

                        Expert Evidence as to Book Entries. - In a prosecution under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIIa32s14-254" target="_blank">G.S. 14-254</a></cite> expert parol evidence may be properly
                        admitted to trace book entries, without contradicting them, so as to show that the officer of the bank had embezzled the bank's funds held in trust, as charged in the bill of indictment. In such case there was no invasion of the
                        province of the jury by the expression of an opinion upon a fact in issue. State v. Maslin, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 537</cite>, 143 S.E. 3 (1928), overruled on other grounds, State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 663</cite>,

                        Instruction That Willfulness Must Be Shown Is Not Error. - In a prosecution under this section for willfully making false entries on the books of a bank, an instruction which was intended to stress and in effect did stress the necessity of proving that
                        the false entries were willfully and not inadvertently made, will not be held for error. State v. Lattimore, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 32</cite>, 158 S.E. 741 (1931).

                        Conviction of Depositor. - In order to convict a depositor of a bank who has abstracted funds from the bank in collusion with its cashier, it is not required that he himself was an officer of the bank or that he was present at the time the money was feloniously
                        "abstracted," under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIIa32s14-254" target="_blank">G.S. 14-254</a></cite>, and he may be convicted thereunder when the bill of
                        indictment substantially follows the language of the statute and the evidence is sufficient to sustain the charge therein. This is not applicable to the provisions of this section as passed in 1921. State v. Switzer, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 88</cite>,
                        121 S.E. 43 (1924).

                    <p>
                        Though the depositor was not present at the time the offense was committed, he may be convicted as a principal under the counts of the indictment so charging the offense. State v. Switzer, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 88</cite>,

                            Allowing Bank Officers to Continue Management Where Insolvency Imminent. - Among other powers conferred by statute, the Corporation Commission (now Commissioner of Banks) may, without taking possession of the business and property of a State bank, upon
                            its appearing to be in imminent danger of insolvency, direct upon what conditions its officers may continue in its management and control, and thus avoid losses to depositors, creditors, and stockholders, necessarily incident
                            to the closing of its doors. Taylor v. Everett, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 247</cite>, 124 S.E. 316 (1924), cited in People's Bank v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 4 F. Supp. 379 (M.D.N.C. 1933),

                        <p>
                            Commissioner as Chancery Receiver. - The functions of the Commissioner of Banks are not limited to the provisions of this section, and the courts of equity have inherent power to permit him to exercise the functions of a chancery receiver in matters which
                            are not inconsistent with his statutory duties. Blades v. Hood, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 56</cite>, 164 S.E. 828 (1932).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Commissioner acts as a receiver under the inherent power of the court only in matters which are not provided for by statute, and his powers and duties in the collection and distribution of the assets of an insolvent bank are derived from the statute.
                            Hoft v. Mohn, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 397</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 23 (1939).

                            Commissioner acts in a capacity equivalent to a receiver in taking over the assets of an insolvent bank, and in such capacity he represents the depositors and other creditors in the collection and distribution of the assets of the bank. Hood v. North
                            Carolina Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 367</cite>, 184 S.E. 51 (1936).

                        <p>
                            Commissioner as Representative of Bank. - Although the ultimate purpose of the collection of assets is for the benefit of the creditors and others entitled to final distribution, and in this sense the Commissioner undoubtedly represents them, yet, in
                            the collection of specific items of debt, in a more technical sense he must be held to represent the bank to whose rights and privileges he has succeeded and which he exercises. He can assert no greater right than that of the
                            bank against any debtor, nor can he avoid any defense which might not be made against the bank. In this respect, he is pro hac vice the bank. The payment by him of a judgment against the bank, out of its funds, has the same
                            effect as it would have had if paid by the bank, and an assignment to him has the force and effect of an assignment to the bank. Hoft v. Mohn, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 397</cite>, 2 S.E.2d
                            23 (1939).

                            Vesting of Title to Assets in Receiver. - Upon the appointment of a receiver under the statute, whether voluntary or by act of the Corporation Commission (now the Commissioner of Banks), the title to all the bank's assets vests in the receiver to be administered
                            for the benefit of its depositors, etc., alike. Douglass v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 458</cite>, 130 S.E. 195 (1925).

                            Purchaser of Bank Draft or Check Not Entitled to Preference. - The purchase of a bank draft, a cashier's check, or a certified check creates the relation of debtor and creditor between the bank and the purchaser, and the purchaser is not entitled to a

                            notice of the bank's insolvency, it was held that the drawer's claim was not entitled to a statutory preference under this section for the reason that the bank did not charge the draft to the account of the drawer; and if the
                            bank's failure to return the draft within 24 hours after its receipt by mail implied an acceptance under the provisions of former G.S. 25-143 and G.S. 25-144, such acceptance did not ipso facto create a preference. Lamb v.

                            Check Presented over Counter Not Within Proviso. - Where a depositor presented his check for payment over the counter of a bank, which charged his account with the amount thereof and gave him a draft drawn on another bank, which was returned unpaid, he
                            was not entitled to a preference in the assets of the bank drawing the draft, the transaction not coming within the proviso in subsection (m), as the check was not received by mail, express, or otherwise. Morecock v. Hood,
