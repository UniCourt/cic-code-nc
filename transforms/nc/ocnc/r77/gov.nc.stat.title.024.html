        Definition of "Interest."
       </b> - "Interest" is the compensation allowed by law, or fixed by the parties, for the use or forbearance of money, as damages for its detention. Brown v. Hiatts, 82 U.S. 177, 21 L. Ed. 128 (1872).

                        The distinction between the "legal rate" of interest, and the "lawful rate" of interest, which is maintained in some states, and which appears in some of the older cases of this State, has not been preserved. Legal rate of interest implied the maximum
                        rate at which interest could be charged upon an obligation in the absence of stipulation as to the rate; and a lawful rate of interest implied that rate of interest which could be lawfully stipulated without incurring the penalty
                        of law. The former was six per cent, the latter eight. See Burwell v. Burgwyn, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. 389</cite>, 6 S.E. 409 (1888).

                        section applied. Barrett Kays &amp; Assocs. v. Colonial Bldg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 525, 500 S.E.2d 108 (1998).

                        of this language is that the new rate of interest shall apply to all of the interest awarded in judgments entered on July 1, 1980, or thereafter, instead of just to that portion of the interest accruing after such date. EEOC v.

                        Unless Defendant Agreed to Rate Set Pay Court. - Where defendant agreed to let the trial court set the rate of interest, he could not on appeal argue that the trial court lacked authority to set the interest rate above the legal rate. Coston v. Coston,

                        Where interest rate on note was usurious and penalty of forfeiture was barred by the statute of limitation, interest allowed was not the maximum legal rate but the legal or judgment rate.

                        a 1980 judgment asking for 6%, court would presume that is what he intended. Speros Constr. Co. v. Musselwhite, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 405 S.E.2d 785 (1991).

                        Fraudulent Procurement of Money. - No implied contract resulted from a defendant's act of fraudulently obtaining the money from a plaintiff or from a court's order that the defendant pay restitution to the plaintiff, because there was no meeting of the
                        minds between the parties. The law in effect at the time of an agreement determines the rate of interest on an obligation only where an agreement has actually been reached. Otherwise, the law in effect at the time of judgment determines
                        the rate of interest. Speros Constr. Co. v. Musselwhite, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 405 S.E.2d 785 (1991).

                        amount of the funds wrongfully disbursed from the accounts. If he had not improperly expended and invested the funds, the minor would have had the benefit of those funds growing in the custodial account; further, the amount of
                        interest was appropriate. Belk v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 728 S.E.2d 356 (2012).

                        Interest Determined by Law in Effect at Time of Agreement. - Where interest rate in contract was void and the legal rate in effect at the time the note was executed was six percent (6%), and subsequently changed to eight percent (8%) by an amendment to
                        this section effective July 1, 1980, interest was determined by the law in effect at the time of the agreement, and changes in the legal rate were not applied retroactively.

                        can be renewed. As it was a separate and distinct action, the plaintiff could request, in his complaint, interest at the legal rate of 8%, and the trial court could award interest at that rate from the date the present action was
                        instituted until the judgment is satisfied. Speros Constr. Co. v. Musselwhite, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 405 S.E.2d 785 (1991).

                        Litigation Lending Agreement was Usurious. - Injured driver's loan agreement with a litigation lender was usurious under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-1.1" target="_self">G.S. 24-1.1</a></cite> since the driver's repayment
                        obligations were ultimately subject to whether the recovery on the personal injury claim was sufficient to satisfy all or part of her debt to the lender, the agreement demonstrated the parties' understanding that the principal
                        "shall be or may be" returned, the interest rate exceeded the permitted amount, and the lender intentionally entered into the contract to receive a greater amount of interest than that allowed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-1.1" target="_self">G.S. 24-1.1</a></cite>.

                        Payment Plan In Excess of Value of Services Held Usurious. - Reorganized check cashing companies' policy of extending an immediate cash rebate and Internet usage to its customers in exchange for a one-year commitment to make bi-weekly payments in an amount
                        equal to five times the amount of the rebate, violated <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-2.1" target="_self">G.S. 24-2.1</a></cite>, was usurious, and constituted an unfair and deceptive trade practice

                        Interest Rate in Violation of This Section Not Enforced. - Where interest due on the note was not subject to forfeiture, usurious twelve percent (12%) rate was not enforced; contract provisions in violation of a statute are contrary to public policy and

                        Forbearance Agreement Held Not Usurious. - A forbearance agreement secured by a second deed of trust and executed after the effective date of former subdivision (3) was not usurious in providing for interest of 9% per annum, notwithstanding the note to

                        Fraudulent Procurement of Money. - No implied contract resulted from a defendant's act of fraudulently obtaining the money from a plaintiff or from a court's order that the defendant pay restitution to the plaintiff, because there was no meeting of the
                        minds between the parties. The law in effect at the time of an agreement determines the rate of interest on an obligation only where an agreement has actually been reached. Otherwise, the law in effect at the time of judgment determines
                        the rate of interest. Speros Constr. Co. v. Musselwhite, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 405 S.E.2d 785 (1991).

                        an amendment to the pleadings so as to reduce the interest sought to that calculated at 12% per annum. Northwestern Bank v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 339 S.E.2d 452, cert. denied,

                    The taking, receiving, reserving or charging a greater rate of interest than permitted by this chapter or other applicable law, either before or after the interest may accrue, when knowingly done, shall be a forfeiture of the entire interest which the
                    note or other evidence of debt carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon. And in case a greater rate of interest has been paid, the person or his legal representatives or corporation by whom it has been paid, may
                    recover back twice the amount of interest paid in an action in the nature of action for debt. In any action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover upon any such note or other evidence of debt, it is lawful for the
                    party against whom the action is brought to plead as a counterclaim the penalty above provided for, to wit, twice the amount of interest paid as aforesaid, and also the forfeiture of the entire interest. If security has been given
                    for an usurious loan and the debtor or other person having an interest in the security seeks relief against the enforcement of the security or seeks any other affirmative relief, the debtor or other person having an interest in the
                    security shall not be required to pay or to offer to pay the principal plus legal interest as a condition to obtaining the relief sought but shall be entitled to the advantages provided in this section. Nothing contained in this section

                        <p>
                            Allowing Interest Is Matter of Legislative Discretion. - At common law the taking of any interest was an indictable offense; hence, interest is now purely statutory, being chargeable in such cases and to such extent only as is expressly allowed by statute.
                            The entire subject of the rate of interest and penalties for usury rests in legislative discretion, and the courts have no power other than to interpret and execute the legislative will. Smith v. Old Dominion Bldg. &amp; Loan
                            Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 249</cite>, 26 S.E. 41 (1896).

                            Provisions Forbidding Usury and Declaring Forfeiture Are Clear. - The provisions of the law forbidding usury are very clear and explicit. No one can possibly misunderstand them. If, moved by avarice, a party deliberately violates this law, he has no ground
                            to complain that his punishment has been in the very respect which caused him to sin, and that in grasping after illegitimate interest he has lost also the legitimate interest which the law would have given a law-abiding citizen.

                            This section was copied from the National Bank Act, and has gone into the laws of many states in exactly the same form. Pinnix v. Maryland Cas. Co., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 760</cite>, 200 S.E. 874 (1939).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The North Carolina penalties for usury were identical with those prescribed in the National Bank Act. Smith v. Old Dominion Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 249</cite>, 26 S.E. 41 (1896).

                        <p>
                            Purpose of Statute. - Both the former and the present statutes were enacted in restraint of excessive interest for the same general policy, and especially on the idea of protecting the borrower against the oppression of the lender, the chief difference
                            being that a violation under the old statute invalidated the contract, working a forfeiture of the sum lent as well as of the interest, whereas the present law leaves the contract valid for the principal, but makes the interest
                            forfeitable. Moore v. Woodward, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 531</cite> (1880).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Statutes prohibiting charging usury or an illegal rate of interest are enacted for the benefit of the borrower. Ector v. Osborne, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 667</cite>, 103 S.E. 388 (1920).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The statute against usury is striking at, and forbidding, the extraction or reception of more than a specified legal rate for the hire of money, and not for anything else. Michigan Nat'l Bank v. Hanner, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 668</cite>,
                            151 S.E.2d 579 (1966); State Whsle. Supply, Inc. v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 227 S.E.2d 120 (1976).

                            Duty of Courts to Carry Out Legislative Intent. - The forfeiture of the entire unpaid interest and recovery back of twice the interest paid is in the nature of a penalty intended to induce an observance of the statute, and it is the duty of the courts
                            so to expound and apply the law as to carry out the legislative intent. Moore v. Woodward, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 531</cite> (1880).

                            Enforceability of Unlawful Interest in Absence of Penalty. - Even in the absence of a penalty on charging usurious interest, such as contained in this section, a rate of interest above the one prescribed by law would not be enforceable. Hughes v. Boones,
                            <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 137</cite>, 9 S.E. 286 (1889).

                        <p>
                            Effect of Usury Formerly and Now. - By the former law, the taint of usury made the contract void both as to principal and interest into whose hands it might come, and so likewise any appearance, shift or device whereupon or whereby an illegal rate of
                            interest was received or taken was declared to be void. By <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-1" target="_self">G.S. 24-1</a></cite> six percent (now eight percent) is fixed as the legal rate
                            of interest, and in case more than the rate allowed is taken, received, reserved, or charged, the contract is not invalidated as to the principal, but the entire interest carried by the note or other evidence of debt, or otherwise
                            agreed to be paid thereon, is, under this section, forfeited; and in case such greater rate has been paid, a remedy is given to the party paying the same to recover by action of debt twice the amount of the interest paid. Moore
                            v. Woodward, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 531</cite> (1880).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The forfeiture provided by this section will be enforced against the usurer, when he seeks to recover upon the usurious contract or transaction. His debt will be stripped of all its interest-bearing quality, and he will be permitted to recover only the
                            principal sum loaned. If a sum in excess of interest at the legal rate has not only been charged by the lender, but has also been paid by the borrower for the use of money, then the person, or his legal representative, or the
                            corporation by whom the same has been paid, may recover twice the amount paid in an action in the nature of action for debt. Waters v. Garris, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 305</cite>, 124 S.E.
                            334 (1924); Sloan v. Piedmont Fire Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 690</cite>, 128 S.E. 2 (1925); Ripple v. Mortgage &amp; Acceptance Corp., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 422</cite>, 137 S.E. 156 (1927).

                            Under this section, usury does not invalidate a contract. It simply works a forfeiture of the entire interest, and subjects the lender to liability to the borrower for twice the amount of interest paid. Wilkins v. Commercial Fin. Co.,

                            A note otherwise valid is not rendered void either as to principal or interest by the taint of usury, but is subject only to the penalties and forfeitures of this section, one of which is the forfeiture of all interest when usury is properly pleaded and

                            A note executed and delivered as evidence of the promise of the maker to pay to the payee or his order a sum of money which has been loaned by the payee to the maker is not void, although the payee has knowingly taken, received, reserved, or charged interest
                            on the note at a greater rate than six percent (now eight percent) per annum, which is the legal rate in this State; only the promise to pay interest is void in such case. Federal Reserve Bank v. Jones,

                            Four Requisites of Usurious Transaction. - In order to constitute a usurious transaction, four requisites must appear: (1) There must be a loan, express or implied; (2) There must be an understanding between the parties that the money lent shall be returned;
                            (3) For such loan a greater rate of interest than is allowed by law shall be paid or agreed to be paid, as the case may be; and (4) There must exist a corrupt intent to take more than the legal rate for the use of the money
                            loaned. A profit greater than the lawful rate of interest, intentionally exacted as a bonus for the loan of money, imposed upon the necessities of the borrower in a transaction where the treaty is for a loan and the money is
                            to be returned at all events is a violation of the usury laws, it matters not what form or disguise it may assume. Doster v. English, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 339</cite>, 67 S.E. 754 (1910),

                            To maintain an action for the usury penalty the claimant must show: (1) That there was a loan, express or implied, or a forbearance of money; (2) That there was an understanding between the parties that the money lent would be returned; (3) That for such
                            loan or forbearance a greater rate of interest than is allowed by law was paid; and (4) That there was a corrupt intent to take more than the legal rate for the use of the money. Carolina Indus. Bank v. Merrimon,

                            Forbearance of Debt or Loan of Money Is Essential. - It is universally held that in order that a transaction shall fall within the prohibition of the statutes against usury it is essential that there should be a contract for the forbearance of an existing
                            indebtedness or a loan of money. There is no exception to this universal rule, that there must be an extension of credit and an illegal compensation for it, knowingly taken, in order to constitute usury. This is recognized
                            in the earliest cases on the subject up to the present time. Smithwick v. Whitley, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 366</cite>, 67 S.E. 914 (1910); Western Auto Supply Co. v. Vick, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 30</cite>,

                            Forbearance Defined. - For the purpose of applying the law of usury to a given transaction in order to determine its applicability, the term "forbearance" means the contractual obligation of a lender or creditor to refrain for a given period of time from
                            requiring the borrower or debtor to repay the loan or debt which is then due and payable. Western Auto Supply Co. v. Vick, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 30</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 360, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 191</cite>,

                            Corrupt Intent Is Also Essential. - To constitute a usurious transaction, corrupt intent to take more than the legal rate of interest is an essential element. Bailey v. Inman, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 571</cite>, 31 S.E.2d
                            769 (1944).

                        <p>
                            The statutory penalty for charging usurious interest is imposed only when a corrupt intent exists to take more than the legal rate. Perry v. Doub, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 322</cite>, 106 S.E.2d 582 (1959).

                            That Is, Intentional Charging of More Than Lawful Rate. - The "corrupt intent" required to constitute usury is simply the intentional charging of more for money lent than the law allows. Associated Stores, Inc. v. Industrial Loan &amp; Inv. Co., 202 F.
                            Supp. 251 (E.D.N.C. 1962), appeal dismissed, 313 F.2d 134 (4th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 830, 85 S. Ct. 60, 13 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1964), aff'd, 326 F.2d 756 (4th Cir. 1964); Western Auto Supply Co. v. Vick,

                        <p>
                            The statutory penalty for charging usury is the forfeiture of all interest on the loan. The charging of usurious interest as provided for by a partnership agreement is sufficient to cause a forfeiture of all the interest charged. The charging of such
                            usurious interest strips the debt of all interest. It becomes simply a loan which in law bears no interest. Any payments of interest which have been made at a legal rate are by law applied to the only legal indebtedness - the
                            principal sum. Kessing v. National Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823 (1971); Argo Air, Inc. v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 197 S.E.2d
                            256 (1973).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Should the court determine that the transaction was usurious, the court will (1) eliminate the indebtedness of all interest charged, (2) determine the amount of interest paid, and (3) give plaintiff credit on the indebtedness for twice the amount of interest
                            paid. Argo Air, Inc. v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 197 S.E.2d 256 (1973).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The corrupt intent required to constitute usury is simply the intentional charging of more for money lent than the law allows. Where the lender intentionally charges the borrower a greater rate of interest than the law allows and his purpose is clearly
                            revealed on the face of the instrument, a corrupt intent to violate the usury law on the part of the lender is shown. And where there is no dispute as to the facts, the court may declare a transaction usurious as a matter of
                            law. Swindell v. Overton, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 342 S.E.2d 391 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The corrupt intention which is required is not that the offender intended to violate the usury laws. The intent which is required is merely the intention to take the interest which is called for in the loan or forbearance agreement. In the event that
                            the interest agreed upon exceeds that allowed by law under the particular circumstances of the case, the requisite usurious intention exists. Swindell v. Overton, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                            504, 342 S.E.2d 391 (1986).

                            Applicability To Check Cashing Business That Charged Usurious Interest Rates. - Where evidence against a check cashing business established that it executed contracts for usurious loans, it used its alternative business purpose of providing Internet access
                            to consumers as a guise to cover this illegal activity, and no evidentiary basis existed upon which a reasonable fact-finder could reach a contrary conclusion, the State's claims of usury and violations of the Consumer Finance
                            Act were established as a matter of law; moreover, the contracts which customers had with the business were cancelled pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.075.html#t75a01s75-15.1" target="_blank">G.S. 75-15.1</a></cite>,
                            requiring all funds collected by the business pursuant to such contracts to be refunded to the customers. State ex rel. Cooper v. NCCS Loans, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 624 S.E.2d 371 (2005).

                            Evidence of a lender's good intentions is not relevant to the issue of "corrupt intent." Rather, corrupt intent is present where the interest agreed upon exceeds that allowed by law. Swindell v. Overton, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C.

                            Even Where Plaintiff Is in Pari Delicto. - A borrower who has paid usurious interest may under this section recover of the lender twice the amount of usurious interest so paid, notwithstanding that he is in pari delicto in the transaction. Hollowell v.
                            Southern Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 286</cite>, 26 S.E. 781 (1897).

                            But Payment Is Necessary for Recovery. - Before the plaintiff can maintain the action he must pay the usury in money or money's worth. It is well settled that the penalty is not incurred by the charging of usurious interest; it is by taking the usury
                            that the party incurs the penalty, and no action lies therefor until it is paid. Stedman v. Bland, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. 296</cite> (1844); Godfrey v.

                            To be entitled to recover this penalty for usury, plaintiff must have been charged usurious interest and must have actually paid the usurious interest. Adams v. Beard Dev. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 105,

                            Double Recovery Not Allowed If Actual Interest Paid Was Not Usurious. - Where a greater rate of interest than allowed by law was charged by means of a partnership agreement required, but no profit inured to the defendant under this agreement, and the
                            only interest actually paid by plaintiff company was the 8% provided for in the note, this in itself was a legal rate so no usurious interest had been paid, and plaintiff company was not entitled to recover double the amount
                            of the interest. Kessing v. National Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Only where a usurious rate of interest has been paid by the borrower, rather than merely charged by the lender, may the borrower recover double the interest. If a usurious interest rate has been charged but not actually paid, the penalty is forfeiture
                            of the entire interest paid; the borrower is not allowed to recover double the interest. Swindell v. Overton, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 504, 342 S.E.2d 391 (1986).

                            Recovery Cannot Be Had on Allegation of Overpayment by Mistake. - In an action to recover for overpayment of interest, made by mistake, recovery cannot be had for the forfeiture of double the interest as a penalty for usury, since, upon the allegation
                            of such overpayment by mistake, no legal implications arise that the plaintiff is suing for the forfeiture. Gillam v. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 369</cite>, 28 S.E. 470 (1897).

                            Intentional Charging Forfeits Entire Interest. - This section makes the "taking, receiving, reserving or charging usury," when knowingly done, i.e., intentionally done, and not by a mere error of calculation, a forfeiture (not merely forfeitable) of the
                            entire interest which the note carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon. Ward v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 489</cite>, 18 S.E. 717 (1893).

                        <p>

                            But Mere Entry Does Not Constitute Charging. - The mere entry on account and subsequent presentation of a usurious claim is not a "charging" within the meaning of this section. Grant v. Morris &amp; Sons, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. 150</cite>                            (1879).

                        <p>
                            The charging which constitutes a forfeiture is the contract, promise or agreement to a usurious rate of interest as opposed to the actual payment of that interest. Haanebrink v. Meyer, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite>                            646, 267 S.E.2d 598 (1980); Northwestern Bank v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C.

                            Junior Lienor Has Same Rights as Mortgagor as to Senior Debt. - A junior mortgagee enjoining the sale under a senior lien is entitled to have the senior debt stripped of usury and the amount of the debt ascertained at the amount advanced plus interest
                            thereon at the legal rate of six percent (now eight percent), this being the relief to which the mortgagor would be entitled, and equity requiring that the same rule should be applicable to the junior lienor. Pinnix v. Maryland

                            Creditor May Not Evade Statute by Assigning His Debt. - Where defendants had a right to plead usurious payments as a setoff or defense to any action brought by the original creditor, the creditor could not evade the express language of this section by
                            assigning his debt to a third person. Overton v. Tarkington, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 340</cite>, 106 S.E.2d 717 (1959).

                            Insurance Companies Are Subject to Penalties. - An insurance company which charges, retains, or receives interest on a loan made by it in this State, to a policyholder or other person, at a rate in excess of six per centum (now eight percent) per annum
                            is subject to the penalties prescribed by this section notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 58-32 as to the premiums paid on policies. Cowan v. Security Life &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 18</cite>,

                            Two remedies are provided for the enforcement of the penalties authorized by this section: First. Where a greater rate of interest than six per centum (now eight percent) per annum has been paid, the person or his legal representatives or the corporation
                            by whom it has been paid, may recover back twice the amount of interest paid, in an action at law in the nature of an action for debt. Second. In any action brought by the creditor to recover upon any usurious note or other
                            evidence of debt affected with usury, it is lawful for the party against whom the action is brought to plead as a counterclaim or setoff, the penalties provided by the statute, to-wit, twice the amount of interest paid, and
                            also the forfeiture of the entire interest charged. Waters v. Garris, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 305</cite>, 124 S.E. 334 (1924); Overton v. Tarkington, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 340</cite>,

                            By consent judgment entered in an action upon a note, wherein usury is set up by the defendant, and the parties have agreed upon a compromise in a certain sum, signed and entered by the court, the defendant waives his right under the usury law, and may
                            not thereafter maintain the defense that a note he had given the plaintiff, in the amount of the judgment, was tainted with the usury of the first transaction. Ector v. Osborne, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 667</cite>,

                            Recoupment and Revival of Claims. - With respect to interest paid on the note to date, debtors asked the court to extend additional, affirmative relief in the form of a recovery of "twice the amount of interest paid,"
                            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-2" target="_self">G.S. 24-2</a></cite>. Because such demand was affirmative in character, recoupment did not revive monetary damages on claims of interest paid beyond the two year statute
                            of limitations period. however, any interest payments made on the usurious loan on or after November 29, 2008, were within the limitations period and did not require recoupment to revive such claims for relief. McClendon v.

                            New Note Must Be in the Nature of a Compromise in Order to Constitute a Waiver of Right to Plead Usury. - A usurious contract is not purged of the usury by the execution of renewals or by a change in the form of the contract, or by the giving of a separate
                            note for the usurious charge, and in order for an agreement as to the total debt and the execution of a new note therefor to constitute a waiver of the right to plead usury, the new amount arrived at must be agreed to by the
                            debtor as just and due the creditor, taking into consideration his claim of usury, and be in the nature of a compromise and settlement and be a novation rather than a renewal. Hill v. Lindsay,
                            <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 694</cite>, 188 S.E. 406 (1936).

                        <p>
                            Thus, where it was found that the parties agreed upon the total amount of the debt after an accounting involving the credit of sums obtained from the sale of collateral given for the debt, but not involving the question of usury, and that the debtor executed
                            a new note for the balance thus arrived at, it was held insufficient to support the court's conclusion of law that the debtor waived the right to claim usury, the transaction being a renewal rather than a novation. Hill v.
                            Lindsay, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 694</cite>, 188 S.E. 406 (1936).

                            A renewal of the original obligations does not constitute a settlement of the plaintiff's right to invoke the statutory remedy for usury so as to purge the renewal contract of the taint. Henderson v. Security Mfg. &amp; Fin. Co.,

                            Usurious Interest on Other Bonds Is Defense to Suit on Chattel Mortgage Securing Such Interest. - In an action of claim and delivery for certain property conveyed by a chattel mortgage, the defendant can set up the defense of usury upon the allegation
                            that the sole consideration of the bond secured by the mortgage was usurious interest, which had accrued upon certain other bonds executed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Moore v. Woodward,

                            for negotiating a usurious loan. Hansen v. Jonas W. Kessing Co., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 190 S.E.2d 407, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 151</cite>, 191 S.E.2d

                            Defendant cannot avoid payment for brokerage services simply because the defendant and the lender chose to enter into an agreement which was in violation of the North Carolina usury statutes. There is nothing in this record to show that the plaintiff
                            did more than bring the borrower and the lender together. He did not make the loan or negotiate its terms. Hansen v. Jonas W. Kessing Co., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 190 S.E.2d

                            This Section Applicable to Enforce Violations of G.S. 24-10.1. - The statutory penalty for usury requires a defendant which has charged late payments in excess of the legal maximum rate permitted by former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-10ol1e" target="_self">G.S. 24-10(e)</a></cite>                            (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-10.1" target="_self">G.S. 24-10.1</a></cite>) to forfeit all late payment charges to which it might otherwise have been entitled under the terms of the loan, but defendant is
                            not required to forfeit the interest due on the loan itself. Swindell v. Federal Nat'l Mtg. Assoc., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 153</cite>, 409 S.E.2d 892 (1991).

                            Applicable Remedy Was Appropriate. - Debtors' Note was indeed usurious in its contracted rate of interest and was, therefore, an illegal contract as written. The applicable remedy as outlined in statute and case law was appropriate with respect to a forfeiture
                            of the entire interest which the Note carried with it, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-2" target="_self">G.S. 24-2</a></cite>; because debtors' posture with respect to the contract as written
                            was defensive in nature, recoupment permitted such remedy despite a tolling of the statute of limitations. McClendon v. Walter Home Mortg. (In re McClendon), 488 B.R. 876 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2013).

                            Form of Transaction Cannot Conceal Its Usurious Nature. - An express or implied loan, upon the understanding that the money shall be returned at a greater interest rate than the statute allows, whatever the form of the transaction, and with corrupt intent
                            on the part of the lender, is usury under this section, the corrupt intent consisting in "taking, receiving, reserving, or charging" a greater rate than that allowed by law. Swamp Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Yokley,
                            <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 573</cite>, 94 S.E. 102 (1917).

                        <p>
                            Where a transaction is in reality a loan of money, whatever may be its form, and the lender charges for the use of his money a sum in excess of interest at the legal rate, by whatever name the charge may be called, the transaction will be held to be usurious.
                            The law considers the substance and not the mere form or outward appearance of the transaction in order to determine what it in reality is. If this were not so, the usury laws of the State would easily be evaded by lenders
                            of money who would exact from borrowers with impunity compensation for money loaned in excess of interest at the legal rate. Ripple v. Mortgage &amp; Acceptance Corp., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 422</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Where there is negotiation for a loan of money, and the borrower agrees to return the amount advanced at all events, it is a contract of lending; and however the transaction may be shaped or disguised, if a profit or return beyond the legal rate of interest
                            is intended to be made out of the necessities or improvidence of the borrower, or otherwise, the contract is usurious. MacRackan v. Bank of Columbus, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 24</cite>, 80
                            S.E. 184 (1913); Swamp Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Yokley, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 573</cite>, 94 S.E. 102 (1917).

                        <p>
                            The nature and terms of the contract determine its character and purpose, and if usurious in itself it must be so understood to have been intended by the parties, and they cannot be heard to the contrary. So the parties to a contract usurious upon its
                            face, understandingly entered into, must be deemed to have intended to provide for the payment of a rate of interest in excess of that allowed by law, and that is itself a usurious contract. Burwell v. Burgwyn,
                            <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. 389</cite>, 6 S.E. 409 (1888).

                            The courts do not hesitate to look beneath the forms of transactions alleged to be usurious in order to determine whether or not such transactions are in truth and in realty usurious. Ripple v. Mortgage &amp; Acceptance Corp.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 422</cite>, 137 S.E. 156 (1927); Western Auto Supply Co. v. Vick, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 268 S.E.2d 842, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 30</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 360,

                            The vitality of the usury statutes would not be maintained by allowing creditors to charge unlawful interest rates merely by disguising the form of their transactions; the court must be concerned with substance and not form. Western Auto Supply Co. v.
                            Vick, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 268 S.E.2d 842, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 30</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 360, aff'd on rehearing, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 191</cite>,

                        <p>
                            In construing a transaction with regard to the usury statutes the court will look to its substance and not to its form. Pratt v. American Bond &amp; Mtg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 294</cite>, 145 S.E. 396 (1928).

                            And if transaction is a subterfuge it will be treated accordingly. - If in fact the transaction is a bona fide sale and not a loan of money, it is not usurious. But if the form of the transaction is a subterfuge to conceal an exaction of more than the
                            legal rate of interest on what is in fact a loan and not a sale, the transaction will be regarded according to its true character and will be held usurious. Michigan Nat'l Bank v. Hanner, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 668</cite>,

                            A bona fide credit sale upon an installment payment basis does not involve a loan of money or a forbearance of a debt within the meaning and application of the usury laws. Carolina Indus. Bank v. Merrimon, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 335</cite>,

                            Usury cannot be predicated upon the fact that property is sold on credit at an advance over what would be charged in case of a cash sale so long as it appears that the price charged is in fact fixed for the purchase of goods on credit with no intention
                            or purpose of defeating the usury laws, even though the difference between the cash price and the credit price, if considered as interest, amounts to more than the legal rate. Michigan Nat'l Bank v. Hanner,

                            A vendor may fix on his property one price for cash and another for credit, and the mere fact that the credit price exceeds the cash price by a greater percentage than is permitted by the usury laws is a matter of concern to the parties and not to the
                            courts, barring evidence of bad faith. Michigan Nat'l Bank v. Hanner, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 668</cite>, 151 S.E.2d 579 (1966); State Whsle. Supply, Inc. v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite>                            272, 227 S.E.2d 120 (1976).

                            The sale of merchandise is not usurious when the sale is made for one price if cash is paid and for a higher price if payment is deferred or made in future installments, so long as the transaction is not a subterfuge to conceal a usurious loan. State

                            If there is a bona fide purchase of property as opposed to a subterfuge to conceal a loan at a usurious rate, then the usury laws have no application whatsoever, even though the sale is made at an exorbitant price. The reason for the recognition of the
                            time-price doctrine is manifest: The usury laws are directed at the extraction of more than the legal rate of interest for the use of money, and a purchaser can refrain from paying the price asked by the seller if he so chooses.

                            a usurious one coming within the inhibition of the usury statute and the penalty it imposed, though the contract was couched in the language of bargain and sale in order to evade the usury law. Ripple v. Mortgage &amp; Acceptance

                            requires the endorsement of the seller as a guaranty of payment, the transaction, as between the immediate parties thereto, is in effect a loan, and will be so considered, within the meaning and purport of the laws against

                            History. - Prior to the 1959 amendment to this section, it was held that in equity, while a usurious lender could have no relief whatever, neither could a borrower have relief against such a lender, such as enjoining the enforcement of a mortgage, without
                            repaying the principal
                            <i>
    plus
   </i> lawful interest. The basis of this principle was the equitable maxim, "He who seeks equity must do equity." See McBrayer v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. 75</cite> (1831); Cook v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. 127</cite>,

                            it was held that such principle did not apply to a proceeding by a debtor at law for the statutory penalty. See Cheek v. Iron Belt Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 121</cite>, 37 S.E. 150 (1900); Currituck

See Currituck Grain, Inc. v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite>                            563, 222 S.E.2d 1 (1976).

                            Where the payee withholds from the borrower a part of the face amount of the note, the same being a device to evade the usury laws, the borrower is entitled in equity to have the note credited with the amount so withheld upon the maturity of the note

                            Holder in Due Course Occupies No Better Position than Lender. - As to usurious contracts, the law regards the maker, not as in pari delicto, but as acting "in chains," and to permit his contract, which is deemed exacted under duress, to come under the
                            general rule in favor of innocent holders for value of commercial paper, would be to nullify the protecting statute. The recourse of the holder is against the payee and indorser, who is more likely by far to be able to respond
                            than the maker. Ward v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 489</cite>, 18 S.E. 717 (1893).

                            Prior to this section, a usurious contract worked a forfeiture of both the interest and the debt, and it was stated in Coor v. Spicer, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 401</cite> (1871), that under the operation of such a statute,
                            innocent and meritorious holders were obliged to suffer. Faison v.

                            A note tainted with usury retains the taint in the hands of a subsequent holder. The forfeiture of interest is the decree of the law. Faison v. Grandy &amp; Sons, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 827</cite>, 36 S.E. 276 (1900),

                            Notes vitiated by an usurious or gaming consideration cannot be enforced in the most innocent hands, but are always and under all circumstances void. Glenn v. Farmer's Bank, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. 191</cite> (1874);
                            Ward v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 489</cite>, 18 S.E. 717 (1893).

                            Contrary Rule Would Render Usury Statute Nugatory. - If, by passing the note off before maturity and for value, the indorsee may recover on it, the statute is useless, as the protection intended and the penalty and prohibition are alike rendered nugatory.
                            The victim would have no recourse but to suffer in silence. The usury would be collected in spite of the law which had declared the "entire interest forfeited" ab initio, by the fact of "charging or reserving" it. On the other
                            hand, the innocent indorsee has his recourse against the payee who has indorsed the note to him, a recourse which would more surely protect him, being against the party who has money to loan, not to borrow. Ward v. Sugg,

                            Rule Applies to Obligations Secured by Mortgages. - The only case that seems to mitigate against the otherwise uniform tenor of the decisions on this subject is Coor v. Spicer, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 401</cite> (1871),
                            which holds that a mortgage given to secure a usurious bond might be enforced in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value. The case recognizes the general rule, but takes mortgages out of it upon the supposed wording of
                            former G.S. 39-20. Aside from the fact that this is held expressly otherwise in the later case of Moore v. Woodward, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 531</cite> (1880), an examination of former G.S. 39-20 will show that Coor v.
                            Spicer was a palpable inadvertence. That statute in fact does not purport to protect the innocent holder of a mortgage note which is tainted with usury but the "purchaser of the estate or property" at sale under the mortgage,
                            who buys without notice of the usurious taint in the debt secured. It would be a fraud for the mortgagor to stand by and let him purchase without giving him notice, but the make can give no notice usually to the assignee of
                            the note. Ward v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 489</cite>, 18 S.E. 717 (1893).

                            "Shall Be a Forfeiture" Construed. - The Supreme Court has expressly held that the words "shall be a forfeiture" in this section makes void the agreement as to interest. Ward v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 489</cite>,
                            18 S.E. 717 (1893).

                            Corporations Are Embraced Within Usury Laws. - In the absence of special legislation, corporations are embraced in the usury laws just as natural persons are. Commissioners of Craven v. Atlantic &amp; N.C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. 289</cite>                            (1877).

                            Conflict of Laws. - A statute of another state forbidding corporations to plead usury as a defense cannot govern a corporation of this State sued in this State, although the bonds in question were delivered in the other state and made payable there. Commissioners
                            of Craven v. Atlantic &amp; N.C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. 289</cite> (1877).

                        <p>
                            Where such bonds express a rate of interest illegal in this State, and also in the other state, and were issued in payment of a precedent debt and secured by a mortgage on the corporation's property, they could legally bear no greater rate of interest
                            than that allowed in this State. Commissioners of Craven v. Atlantic &amp; N.C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. 289</cite> (1877).

                        <p>
                            Sale of Bonds at Discount. - Under this section as it then read, a corporation could not legally sell its bonds, bearing the highest legal rate of interest, at a discount for the purpose of borrowing money. Such a sale was in effect a loan, and was usurious.
                            Commissioners of Craven v. Atlantic &amp; N.C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. 289</cite> (1877).

                            Provisions of Corporate Charter Construed. - The language in alleged act of incorporation, "May discount notes and other evidences of debt, and lend money upon such terms and rates of interest as may be agreed upon," did not confer the right to exact
                            a rate of interest greater than the legal rate. The statute nowhere confers an express power to exceed the legal rate of interest and the operative words, "any rate of interest that may be agreed on," meant any rate of interest
                            not greater than the legal rate. Simonton v. Lanier, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 498</cite> (1874).

                            Usury must be pleaded. Dixon v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 480</cite>, 168 S.E. 683 (1933).

                        <p>
                            And Proved. - Where there is no evidence that any holder of the note executed by plaintiffs has charged or received interest thereon in excess of six percent (now eight percent), in an action on the note plaintiffs may not invoke the forfeiture of interest
                            for usury. Smith v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 213</cite>, 183 S.E. 276 (1936).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By Whom Pleaded. - The plea of usury is open to the parties and their privies, and may be made when, by the transaction, the debtor's estate is wrongfully depleted, and ordinarily by one having the legal right to protect the estate, as a receiver of an
                            insolvent corporation against which a usurious contract is sought to be enforced. Riley v. Sears, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. 509</cite>, 70 S.E. 997 (1911).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Class Actions Allowed. - When the General Assembly has wished to prevent class actions to enforce statutory claims for relief, where the relief sought was personal and penal in nature, it has said so expressly and unequivocally. The failure of the General
                            Assembly to expressly prohibit class actions to enforce this statute convinces the Supreme Court that it intended to allow them for such purposes. Crow v. Citicorp Acceptance Co., <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 274</cite>,
                            354 S.E.2d 459 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Rights of Trustee in Bankruptcy. - A right of action to recover the penalty for a usury charge is in the nature of an action for debt, and is a wrongful detention of, or injury to, the estate of the bankrupt which passes to his trustee in bankruptcy.
                            Ripple v. Mortgage &amp; Acceptance Corp., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 422</cite>, 137 S.E. 156 (1927).

                        <p>
                            When Tender Is Required. - A claim of forfeiture of all interest for usury may be properly set up as a defense in the creditor's action on the debt without a tender of the debt with legal interest. Tender is required only when the debtor seeks affirmative
                            equitable relief such as enjoining the collection of the debt or the foreclosure of the security therefor. Virginia Trust Co. v. Lambeth Realty Corp., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 526</cite>, 2
                            S.E.2d 544 (1939).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Counterclaim Is Available. - While a counterclaim for usury may be set up in an action on a note under this section, such counterclaim may not be set up in an action in ejectment based on title to the property under foreclosure of the deed of trust
                            securing the note. North Carolina Mtg. Corp. v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 493</cite>, 171 S.E. 783 (1933).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The purpose and intent of the counterclaim provision was not to restrict the right of recovery by way of counterclaim, but rather to make it clear that the right granted by the statute to recover the penalty for usurious interest paid "in the action in
                            the nature of action for debt," could be pleaded as a counterclaim in an action between the parties. Commercial Credit Corp. v. Robeson Motors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 326</cite>, 90
                            S.E.2d 886 (1956).

                        <p>
                            While this section provides that a counterclaim for usury may be set up in an action to recover upon the note or other evidence of debt, on which the alleged usurious interest has been charged, such a counterclaim may not be pleaded in an action based
                            on other cause of action. Commercial Fin. Co. v. Holder, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 96</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 794 (1952).

                        <p>
                            There was no conflict between this section and subsection (2) of former G.S. 1-137 in reference to pleading of counterclaim for usury. Commercial Credit Corp. v. Robeson Motors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 326</cite>,
                            90 S.E.2d 886 (1956).

                        <p>
                            Construing this section and former G.S. 1-137 (2) in pari materia, where a lender brings an action to recover on a note or other evidence of debt, the borrower, by counterclaim in such action, can recover the penalty for usurious interest paid by the
                            borrower to the lender in connection with separate and independent transactions between them. Commercial Credit Corp v. Robeson Motors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 326</cite>, 90 S.E.2d
                            886 (1956).

                        <p>
                            Definiteness of Allegations. - In an action brought to recover money alleged to be due on a contract entered into between the parties, wherein the plea of usury is set up in the answer and a recovery is sought under this section for double the amount
                            of the interest paid, the recovery sought is in the nature of a penalty; when the facts are known or readily obtainable the law requires a definite statement in the pleading as to the time and amount, before allegations in
                            such action are held to be sufficient, and when such statement is not made no amendment to the pleadings should be allowed. Riley v. Sears, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. 509</cite>, 70 S.E. 997
                            (1911).

                        <p>
                            Burden of Proof on Plaintiff. - Upon the trial of an action to recover for usury, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff throughout the trial to establish his cause of action. Hodge v. First Atl. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            632, 179 S.E.2d 855, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 701</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 602 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where plaintiff failed to show that defendant did not in fact render services for the one percent "service charge" or "construction loan fee," defendant was entitled to directed verdict that such "charge" or "fee" was not a part of the interest charged
                            on the loan. Hodge v. First Atl. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 632, 179 S.E.2d 855, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 701</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 602 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Amendment of Complaint. - Where plaintiff in its complaint sought interest in excess of the 12% allowed under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-1.1" target="_self">G.S. 24-1.1</a></cite>, but presented evidence as to the
                            amount of interest when calculated at 12%, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting an amendment to the pleadings so as to reduce the interest sought to that calculated at 12% per annum. Northwestern Bank v.
                            Barber, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 339 S.E.2d 452, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 733</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 391 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Statute of Limitations. - An action to recover the penalty for usury, under this section, is barred after the lapse of two years from the accrual of the cause of action in the absence of disability or nonresidence affecting the running of the statute.
                            Smith v. Finance Co. of Am., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 367</cite>, 177 S.E. 183 (1934).

                        <p>
                            Where plaintiff filed his complaint seeking forfeiture of all interest more than two years after the execution of promissory note, the two-year statute of limitations barred plaintiff's claim for forfeiture of interest pursuant to this section. Adams
                            v. Beard Dev. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 105, 446 S.E.2d 862 (1994).

                        <p>
                            Same - Nonresident Creditor. - An action for the statutory penalty for charging usury, brought against a nonresident creditor who has no agent here upon whom process may be served, is not barred by the statute of limitations, nor does the fact in such
                            case that one of the plaintiffs is a nonresident and the other has changed his residence affect the matter. Cuthberton v. Peoples Bank, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 531</cite>, 87 S.E. 333 (1915).

                        <p>
                            Setting Aside Fraudulent Conveyance. - In a creditor's action to establish its debt and to have a subsequent conveyance by the debtor set aside as fraudulent as to creditors, the fact that plaintiff's debt is tainted with usury entitles defendant debtor
                            to invoke the forfeiture of interest, but does not defeat plaintiff's action, or estop plaintiff from asserting the equitable remedy of setting aside the fraudulent conveyance under the doctrine that he who seeks equity must
                            come into court with clean hands. Virginia Trust Co. v. Lambeth Realty Corp., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 526</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 544 (1939).

                            Restraining Foreclosure. - The holder of a second mortgage, able and willing to pay the amount of the debt secured by the first mortgage, but alleging usury under this section, is entitled to have a restraining order against foreclosure continued until
                            determination of the issue of usury. Wilson v. Union Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 788</cite>, 158 S.E. 479 (1931).

                            Usury as Question of Law When Facts Not in Dispute. - What constitutes usury is a question of law to be determined by the court when the facts are not in dispute. Grant v. Morris &amp; Sons, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. 150</cite>                            (1879).

                            When Usury Is Question for Jury. - Where, in an action upon a note, the defendant pleads the usury statute, and the evidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict that the excess of interest was a proper charge made for negotiating the loan, the question
                            should be submitted to the jury. Swamp Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Yokley, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 573</cite>, 94 S.E. 102 (1917).

                            Where the plea of the usury under this section is made by the plaintiff in the action to enjoin the defendant from the sale of land securing a mortgage note, and there is a dispute as to whether the charge made was usurious, and as to the amount due under
                            the mortgage, it is reversible error for the trial judge to assume the correctness of the plaintiff's contentions as a fact, and take the case from the jury accordingly. Miller v. Dunn, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 379</cite>,

                            The fact that a sum borrowed was made payable to the borrowers and an attorney with allegations and evidence that the attorney under instructions from the lender deducted a certain sum therefrom before the borrowers could obtain the money, together with
                            the "item of expense" set out in the deed of trust securing the loan, is held sufficient to have been submitted to the jury on the question of usury. Jonas v. Home Mtg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 89</cite>,

                            Where the plaintiff alleged usury and the defendant contended that the transaction was within the "commission for the sale of bonds" exception to the usury law, it was held that as the evidence was conflicting it was properly submitted to the jury, and
                            was sufficient to support its verdict in plaintiff's favor. Sherrill v. Hood, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 472</cite>, 181 S.E. 330 (1935).

                    Guardians shall have power to lend any portion of the estate of their wards upon bond with sufficient security, to be repaid with interest annually, and all the bonds, notes or other obligations which he shall take as guardian shall bear compound interest,

                    than the maximum lawful rate. This section shall in no way limit or affect the powers of guardians to make other investments which are now or may hereafter be authorized or permitted by the laws, statutory or otherwise, of the State

                        Security in Addition to That of Borrower Must Be Taken. - The policy of this section is to require an investment by a guardian to be secured by the bond or note of some person in addition to the borrower. Watson v. Holton,

                        Or Guardian Is Liable for Any Loss. - Where guardian loaned the money of his ward to a trading firm composed of two partners, who both became insolvent at the same time, and from the same causes, no security having been taken besides the names of the
                        two partners, it was held that the guardian was accountable for the money thus loaned, notwithstanding at the time of this loan the partners were considered as entirely solvent and their failure was sudden and unexpected. Boyett
                        v. Hurst, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. 166</cite> (1854).

                    <p>
                        A guardian will be held liable for any loss resulting from a loan made without taking any security, however solvent the debtor may have been when the loan was made. Collins v. Gooch, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 186</cite>, 1

                        A guardian's primary duty is to invest the trust fund, and he will be chargeable with interest in the absence of proof that it remained in his hands unemployed without his fault.

                        Calculation of Compound Interest. - The rule for compounding interest on notes due guardians is "to make annual rests," making the aggregate of principal and interest due at the end of a particular year a new principal, bearing interest thenceforward
                        for another year. Ford v. Vandyke, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. 227</cite> (1850); Little v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 190</cite> (1874).

                        then interest on an award in a contract action shall be at the contract rate after judgment; otherwise it shall be at the legal rate. On awards in actions on contracts pursuant to which credit was extended for personal, family,

                            The legislature could reasonably have concluded that the classification scheme established by this section would best serve to further important and legitimate public purposes, including compensation of a plaintiff for the loss-of-use value of a damage
                            award, the prevention of unjust enrichment to liability insurers who are required by law to maintain claim reserves on which interest is earned, and the promotion of settlement by these insurers, who, unlike self-insurers,
                            have as their primary business the insuring, investigation, defense and settlement of claims. The Legislature could have reasonably concluded that the distinction between defendants with liability insurance and those without
                            was a valid one, and that the public welfare would be best served by such a classification. Therefore, this section does not create a special emolument or privilege within the meaning of N.C. Const., Art. I,

                            Section Changes Common Law. - At common law a judgment did not carry interest when an execution of sci. fa. was issued upon it. In an action upon the judgment the plaintiff could recover interest by way of damages for the detention of the money. The statute
                            was passed for the purpose of amending the law in this respect. Collais v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. 221</cite> (1848). The intent was that the principal should bear interest because
                            it was just and right that it should, and that the technical rule of the common law should no longer stand in the way. McNeill v. Durham &amp; C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 1</cite>, 50 S.E. 458 (1905).

                            This section is not exclusive in prescribing instances in which interest is recoverable, and in proper instances interest may be recovered upon transactions not coming within the statute. Anderson Cotton Mills v. Royal Mfg. Co.,

                            Application of Section. - This section is obviously referring to claims which are defended by the liability insurer, because there is no logical reason to distinguish between claims against an uninsured defendant and an insured defendant defending a claim
                            which falls short of the deductible amount of the insurance policy. R-Anell Homes, Inc. v. Alexander &amp; Alexander, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 303 S.E.2d 573 (1983).

                            Purpose of 1981 Amendment. - The legislature's purpose in amending this section in 1981 to provide for prejudgment interest in tort actions when the claim is covered by liability insurance was to provide an incentive to insurance companies to expeditiously
                            litigate actions they are involved in. Harwood v. Harrelson Ford, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 445, 337 S.E.2d 158 (1985).

                            Applicability of 1981 Amendment. - The Legislature's intent was to make Session Laws 1981, c. 327, G.S. 1, which amended this section, inapplicable to pending litigation. Harwood v. Harrelson Ford, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite>                            445, 337 S.E.2d 158 (1985).

                            Purpose of 1985 Amendment. - When the legislature amended subsection (a) in 1985 to provide that the amount awarded on contract bears interest from date of breach it obviated the need for the rule that when the amount of damages in a breach of contract
                            action is ascertained from contract itself, relevant evidence, or both, interest should be allowed from the date of breach. Metromont Materials Corp. v. R.B.R. &amp; S.T., <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite>                            616, 463 S.E.2d 305 (1995).

                        <p>
                            Applicability of 1985 Amendment. - The important date for determining whether the 1985 amendment to this section applies to any action is the date the action is commenced and not the date the contract was entered; therefore, the amendment, effective Oct.
                            1, 1985, and applicable to all claims except claims pending on that date, clearly applied to action for breach of contract instituted Aug. 21, 1986. Pickard Roofing Co. v. Barbour, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite>                            688, 381 S.E.2d 341 (1989).

                            Judgment Bears Interest Though Nothing Is Said. - By virtue of this section a judgment bears interest from the time of its rendition until paid, though nothing is said therein about interest. McNeill v. Durham &amp; C.R.R.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 1</cite>, 50 S.E. 458 (1905).

                        <p>
                            This section was held directory so far as it provided that the judgment must itself state that it shall bear interest from the date of rendition until it is paid. It is perfectly clear that such a statement in the judgment is not essential to effectuate
                            the intent of the Legislature, which is to allow interest on judgments. McNeill v. Durham &amp; C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 1</cite>, 50 S.E. 458 (1905).

                        <p>
                            If Judgment Enables Officer to Compute Interest. - It is best always that the court in its judgment should state fully the amount to be raised by the execution, both principal and interest; but the plaintiff will not forfeit his right to interest by the
                            failure to do this, when enough appears on the face of the judgment to enable the officer to compute the amount justly due. All he is required to know is the amount of the principal, and then the statute makes that amount bear
                            interest to the time of payment. McNeill v. Durham &amp; C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 1</cite>, 50 S.E. 458 (1905).

                            Interest on Contracts and Torts Distinguished. - Where a verdict is given in an action on contract in plaintiff's favor for moneys due by the defendant to plaintiff's intestate, interest is also given plaintiff on the amount of the recovery as a matter
                            of law, when not incorporated in the verdict. When in tort the matter of interest is awarded or not according as the jury may find. Thomas v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 630</cite>, 137

                            was delayed by reason of the fact that the trust agreement under which the policy was assigned was changed without notice to insurer by adding an individual trustee and that the corporate trustee became insolvent before payment

                            between the principal and interest was intended to provide for those cases in which the whole sum is assessed in damages, so as to enable the clerk or the sheriff to compute the interest on the principal sum. But where the
                            principal and interest are discriminated on the record, or it can be collected from an inspection of it what the principal sum was, it is equally within the spirit of the act that interest should be calculated on that. Deloach

                            This section does not require that the issue be submitted to the jury before interest can be allowed in contract cases. The requirement is merely that the jury "distinguish the principal from the sum allowed as interest," which obviously pertains only
                            to those rare situations where evidence as to both principal and interest is submitted to the jury for their consideration. Dailey v. Integon Gen. Ins.

                            In a case involving the amount due under an insurance policy, computing the interest due was a mere clerical matter, and it would have been an absurd, pointless waste of time to ask the jury to "distinguish" between principal and interest. Dailey v. Integon

                            In Tort Actions Judgment for Damages Bears Interest. - Although the allowance of interest in an action for damages for conversion of property is discretionary with the jury, yet, after the verdict, the judgment for the damages assessed bears interest
                            by virtue of this section, and this is so, even though the verdict is for a certain sum "without interest." Stephens v. Koonce, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. 266</cite>, 9 S.E. 315 (1889).

                            It Is Discretionary with Jury to Include Interest in Verdict. - In an action for damages for conversion, the verdict being for the value of the property at the time of the conversion, interest can only begin from the time of the judgment. However, the
                            jury may allow interest on the amount of the damages from time of the conversion. Lance v. Butler, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 419</cite>, 47 S.E. 488 (1904).

                        <p>
                            The rule in this State is that interest, as interest, is allowed only when expressly given by statute, or by the express or implied agreement of the parties. Devereux v. Burgwin, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. 490</cite> (1850);
                            Lewis v. Rountree, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. 122</cite> (1878). The only statute upon the subject is that contained in this section, which provides that all sums of money due by contract of any kind whatsoever, excepting
                            such as may be due on penal bonds, shall bear interest, etc., but there is no provision made for actions of trover or trespass de bonis asportatis. In such cases, in order to compel the wrongdoer to make full compensation to
                            the injured party, the jury may, in their discretion, and as damages, allow interest upon the value of the property from the time of its conversion or seizure, and it has been usual for them to do so. But there is no rule which
                            gives it as a matter of law and right. Patapsco v. Magee, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 350</cite> (1882).

                            No Interest on Awards Under State Tort Claims Act Absent Express Statutory Authority. - Because the State Tort Claims Act (G.S. 143-291 et seq.) is in derogation of sovereign immunity, and should, therefore, be strictly construed as written, there must
                            be a specific statutory provision authorizing the accrual of interest on damage awards under the act. And although this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-7" target="_self">G.S. 24-7</a></cite>                            refer to post-judgment interest, the General Assembly nevertheless recently enacted <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.097.html#t97a01s97-86.2" target="_blank">G.S. 97-86.2</a></cite> allowing interest on workers'

                            with assets insufficient to pay depositors in full, the State agency may not hold the surety liable for interest from the time action on the bond is instituted, since in such circumstances the bank is not liable for interest,
                            but the surety is liable for interest only from the date of judgment against it on the bond on the amount for which the bank is liable to the State agency as of that date. State v. United States Guarantee Co.,

                            Applicability of Subsection (b). - In determining the question of prejudgment interest, where there is no question of liability and no judgment entered as to this issue, subsection (b) of this section does not apply. Barnes v. Hardy,

                            No award of prejudgment interest, because subsection (b) is inapplicable, since a final judgment, including a judgment as to liability, had not been entered. Collins v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 128,

                            In a data company's action against a competitor that hired its former employee, prejudgment interest was warranted because the federal court was required to apply the law of the forum, which mandated prejudgment interest. Legacy Data Access, LLC v. Mediquant,

                            Recovery of Interest Under Subsection (b). - Subsection (b) of this section provides for the recovery of interest in instances where there has been both a judgment as to liability and a determination of appropriate compensatory damages. Barnes v. Hardy,

                            In a wrongful death action based on the medical specialist's malpractice, the trial court did not err in requiring the specialist to pay all pre-judgment interest and costs; even if the claim of error had been preserved for appeal, there was no error
                            because the trial court properly determined costs and interest before entitling the specialist to set-off for the settlement amount involving the other treating doctor, as <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-5ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 24-5(b)</a></cite>                            required that the pre-judgment interest be awarded before the set-off was given for the settlement amount.

                            Failure to include interest mandated by the statute constitutes a clerical mistake; the trial court was correct to look to the statute when deciding the attorney's motion for interest, and the fact that the attorney mistakenly requested relief pursuant
                            to another subsection of the statute was not determinative, as the trial court had the authority to correct its oversight regardless of the arguments the attorney made. Robertson v. Steris Corp.,

                            Trial court properly ruled that interest on the attorney's quasi-contract claim for quantum meruit was controlled by the second subsection of the statute, and although the trial court did not expressly designate the award in quantum meruit as compensatory
                            damages, that designation was clearly inferred in the order, and the interest awarded was affirmed. Robertson v. Steris Corp., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 263, 765 S.E.2d 825 (2014).

                            Prejudgment Interest Held Not a Cost Within Meaning of Policy. - Where insurance policy provided that, in addition to the policy limits, insurance company would pay all defense costs they incurred, prejudgment interest was not a defense cost within the
                            meaning of the policy. Sproles v. Greene, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 603</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 497 (1991).

         Liability of Insurer for Prejudgment Interest.
        </b> - Since insurer's insurance contract with the insured provided it would pay "all costs taxed to the insured in a suit we defend" it was liable for prejudgment interest under its contract of insurance. However,
                            prejudgment interest could not be awarded on the amount of the judgment in excess of the insurer's liability limits; thus, insured's liability was limited to interest on the amount of the judgment which represented its insurance

                            A liability carrier's obligation to pay prejudgment interest in addition to its stated limits is governed solely by the language of the policy. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mabe, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 193,
                            444 S.E.2d 664 (1994), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 482</cite>, 467 S.E.2d 34 (1996).

                        <p>
                            Insurance company was obligated to pay prejudgment interest as part of the total of any damages up to its liability limit; therefore, where the total judgments exceeded the policy's limit of liability, the individual claimants were not entitled to any
                            prejudgment interest. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mabe, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 444 S.E.2d 664 (1994), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 482</cite>, 467 S.E.2d 34 (1996).

                        <p>
                            There is no statutory provision mandating that insurance carriers pay prejudgment interest that exceeds the stated limit of liability under the terms of the insurance contract, and since this section is not part of the Financial Responsibility Act, it
                            is not written into every insurance policy. Watlington v. North Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 446 S.E.2d 614 (1994).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whether the insurance policy expressly provided that prejudgment interest was calculable as a part of damages and was therefore included under the liability limits of the policy, defendant insurance company was not obligated to pay prejudgment interest
                            above the policy limit of liability. Watlington v. North Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 446 S.E.2d 614 (1994).

                        <p>
                            The language of a liability carrier's policy controls the liability carrier's obligation to pay prejudgment interest in addition to its stated limits. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mabe, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 482</cite>,

                            Nothing prevents a liability insurer from defining "damages" to include prejudgment interest and then capping the amount of damages that can be paid. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mabe, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 482</cite>,

                            Rule 3 provides that a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court, prejudgment interest is allowed to accrue from the date of filing with the court; thus, the court did not err in allowing prejudgment interest
                            for the period prior to the time defendants were served with a valid complaint. Harris v. Scotland Neck Rescue Squad, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 444, 331 S.E.2d 695, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 329</cite>,

                            In a damage action arising out of an automobile collision, the defendants' admission in their answer of the existence of liability insurance was binding upon the parties and the trial judge. Therefore, the court's assessment of interest from the date

                            Where neither the arbitration agreement nor the arbitration award provided for prejudgment interest, the trial court was obligated to confirm the award as written and, accordingly, even if the arbitrator's failure to include prejudgment interest was a

                            only insured for less than half that amount. To do so would run counter to the policy reasons surrounding the enactment of subsection (b). Petty v. Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                            559, 369 S.E.2d 612 (1988).

                            The trial court properly ordered that prejudgment interest attach to the amount recovered under an insurance policy, even though the damages were unliquidated and undetermined until the verdict was rendered. Nothing in this section supports the proposition
                            that a party obligated by contract to pay money to another can use the other party's money at no cost merely because the exact amount due has not already been established. Dailey v. Integon Gen. Ins. Corp.,

                            Action on Uninsured Motorist Coverage. - Although plaintiff's uninsured motorist coverage was provided by insurance contract, the right to recover thereon was grounded in tort. Therefore, plaintiff insured's action to recover under the policy met the
                            first requirement for an award of prejudgment interest under this section, i.e., it was an action "other than contract." Further, the uninsured motorist coverage under which the insured sought damages was liability insurance.
                            Thus, by the uninsured motorist coverage contained in the motor vehicle liability insurance policy, the insurer assumed, up to its policy limits, the liability of the uninsured motorist for damages which the insured was legally
                            entitled to recover from the uninsured motorist. Therefore, the insured was entitled to an award of interest from the date the action was instituted. Ensley v.

                            Proof of Insurance Coverage. - The court did not err by allowing prejudgment interest where plaintiff presented no evidence that defendant carried liability insurance covering claim, since this section does not require plaintiff to present such evidence.
                            Indeed, the law prohibits plaintiff from introducing such evidence at trial.

                            Calculation of Prejudgment Interest. - The correct method of reducing a claim against a non-settling tortfeasor when prejudgment interest applies is to convert the settlement amount to judgment-time dollars, using the same legal rate of interest that
                            is used in calculating prejudgment interest on the compensatory damages verdict, then subtracting the adjusted settlement figure from the adjusted compensatory damages figure. Brown v. Flowe,

                        No Interest on Awards Under State Tort Claims Act Absent Express Statutory Authority. - Because the State Tort Claims Act (G.S. 143-291 et seq.) is in derogation of sovereign immunity, and should, therefore, be strictly construed as written, there must
                        be a specific statutory provision authorizing the accrual of interest on damage awards under the act. And although <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24a01s24-5" target="_self">G.S. 24-5</a></cite> and this section

                        North Carolina courts do not hesitate to look beneath the forms of transactions alleged to be usurious in order to determine whether or not such transactions are in truth and reality usurious. Kessing v. National Mtg. Corp.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823 (1971).

                        Where a transaction is in reality a loan of money, whatever may be its form, and the lender charges for the use of his money a sum in excess of interest at the legal rate, by whatever name the charge may be called, the transaction will be held to be usurious.
                        The law considers the substance and not the mere form or outward appearance of the transaction in order to determine what it in reality is. If this were not so, the usury laws of the State would easily be evaded by lenders of money
                        who would exact from borrowers with impunity compensation for money loaned in excess of interest at the legal rate. Kessing v. National Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823

                        What Plaintiff Must Show in Action for Usury. - In an action for usury plaintiff must show (1) that there was a loan, (2) that there was an understanding that the money lent would be returned, (3) that for the loan a greater rate of interest than allowed
                        by law was paid, and (4) that there was corrupt intent to take more than the legal rate for the use of the money. Kessing v. National Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823

                        The corrupt intent required to constitute usury is simply the intentional charging of more for money lent than the law allows. Kessing v. National Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823 (1971); Appalachian

                        Where the lender intentionally charges the borrower a greater rate of interest than the law allows and his purpose is clearly revealed on the face of the instrument, a corrupt intent to violate the usury law on the part of the lender is shown. Kessing
                        v. National Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823 (1971); Appalachian S., Inc. v. Construction Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 182 S.E.2d 15, cert.

                    <p>
                        The limitation imposed by this section concerns a thing of value other than that which is pledged as security or collateral to secure the repayment of the full principal of the loan, together with fees and interest. Thus, where defendant's endorsement
                        and guaranty agreements served as security for loan, and no additional sum or thing of value was involved other than securing for plaintiff that the loan would be repaid in full, this section was not violated. Northwestern Bank
                        v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 339 S.E.2d 452, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 733</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 391 (1986).

                    <p>
                        A 25% interest in a partnership (which owned the realty conveyed to it by plaintiff) was a "thing of value." Kessing v. National Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823 (1971).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        And this made the partnership agreement unlawful. Kessing v. National Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823 (1971).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Hence, the loan was usurious under this section. Kessing v. National Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Transaction Violating Statute Unenforceable. - Where the defendant's counterclaims relate to the limited partnership and the trial court correctly adjudged that the loan transaction considered as a whole violated this section, it followed, therefore,
                        that the limited partnership agreement and the conveyances made to the partnership contrary to this section were void and the courts will not lend their aid to the enforcement of a contract which is unlawful and violates its positive
                        legislation. Kessing v. National Mtg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 523</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 823 (1971).

                        by this section. Bagri v. Desai, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 349 S.E.2d 309 (1986), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 102</cite>, 353 S.E.2d 103 (1987).

                        for personal, family, or household purposes, and (iii) the loan is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust upon real estate upon which there is located or there is to be located a structure or structures designed principally for
