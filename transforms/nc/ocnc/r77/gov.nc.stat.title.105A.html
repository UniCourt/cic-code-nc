       § 105A-1. Purposes.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of this Chapter is to establish as policy that all claimant agencies and the Department of Revenue shall cooperate in identifying debtors who owe money to the State or to a local government through their various agencies and who qualify for refunds from the Department of Revenue. It is also the intent of this Chapter that procedures be established for setting off against any refund the sum of any debt owed to the State or to a local government. Furthermore, it is the legislative intent that this Chapter be liberally construed so as to effectuate these purposes as far as legally and practically possible.

      - Session Laws 1987, c. 856, which deleted a reference to the Lenox Baker Children's Hospital near the end of subdivision (1)j, provided in s. 20 that ss. 1 through 19 of the act would be effective only upon agreement by Duke University to the terms of ss. 21 through 26 of the act and certification of that fact by the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources to the Governor, and that ss. 12 to 17 would then be effective on the date of the transfer. Section 20 further provided that any disputes arising out of the transfer would be resolved by the Director of the Budget. Sections 21 through 26 of the act provided terms for the transfer of the Lenox Baker Hospital to Duke University. The letter of certification from the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources was dated October 5, 1988, but it appears that this was a typographical error and that October 5, 1987, was the correct date.

      <li id="t105Aa01s105A-3ol1b">
       Mandatory State Usage. - A State agency must submit a debt owed to it for collection under this Chapter unless the State Controller has waived this requirement or the State agency has determined that the validity of the debt is legitimately in dispute, an alternative means of collection is pending and believed to be adequate, or such a collection attempt would result in a loss of federal funds. The State Controller may waive the requirement for a State agency, other than the Department of Health and Human Services or a county acting on behalf of that Department, to submit a debt owed to it for collection under this Chapter if the State Controller finds that collection by this means would not be practical or cost effective. A waiver may apply to all debts owed a State agency or a type of debt owed a State agency.

       Optional Local Usage. - A local agency may submit a debt owed to it for collection under this Chapter. A local agency that decides to submit a debt owed to it for collection under this Chapter must establish the debt by following the procedure set in G.S. 105A-5 and must submit the debt through one of the following:

      </li>
      <li id="t105Aa01s105A-3ol1d">
       Registration and Reports. - A State agency must register with the Department and with the State Controller.

       Tax Refunds.
   
   - Section (b) dictates that the North Carolina Department of Human Resources must first obtain an opinion from the Attorney General resending the propriety of collecting a child support arrearage by the interception of a state tax refund before doing so. Davis v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 208</cite>, 505 S.E.2d 77 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before a state agency could intercept the state-income tax refund of a father, the agency had the affirmative duty to seek and obtain the Attorney General's advice or opinion that the child support repayment plan established by the district court was an adequate way of collecting an arrearage, where the father was current with his court-ordered child support obligation, and the arrearage was a public assistance debt that was incurred before the father's paternity adjudication.

      </li>
      <li id="t105Aa01s105A-5ol1b">
       Notice. - A local agency must send written notice to a debtor that the agency intends to submit the debt owed by the debtor for collection by setoff. The notice must explain the basis for the agency's claim to the debt, that the agency intends to apply the debtor's refund against the debt, and that a collection assistance fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) will be added to the debt if it is submitted for setoff. The notice must also inform the debtor that the debtor has the right to contest the matter by filing a request for a hearing with the local agency, must state the time limits and procedure for requesting the hearing, and must state that failure to request a hearing within the required time will result in setoff of the debt.

Similarly, if a local agency submits a debt for collection under this Chapter after sending the required notice but before final determination of the debt and a decision finds that the local agency is not entitled to any part of the amount set off, the agency must send the taxpayer the entire amount set off plus the collection assistance fees provided in G.S. 105A-13.

A request for a hearing on a contested claim of any State agency must be filed within 30 days after the State agency mails the debtor notice of the proposed setoff. A request for a hearing is considered to be filed when it is delivered for mailing with postage prepaid and properly addressed. In a hearing under this section, an issue that has previously been litigated in a court proceeding cannot be considered.

      If a debtor owes a debt to a State agency and the net proceeds credited to the State agency for the debt exceed the amount of the debt, the State agency must send the balance to the debtor. No part of the collection assistance fee retained by the Department may be returned when a debt is owed but it is less than the amount set off.
