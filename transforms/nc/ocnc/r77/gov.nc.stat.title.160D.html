                <p>
                    Session Laws 2019-111, s. 2.10, provides: "If Part II of this act becomes law in 2019, it is the intent of the General Assembly that legislation contained in Part I of this act or in other acts enacted in the 2019 Regular Session of the 2019 General Assembly,
                    or that affects statutes repealed and replaced by similar provisions in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 160D</a></cite> of the General Statutes, as enacted by Part
                    II of this act, also be incorporated into <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 160D</a></cite> of the General Statutes. It is the further intent of the General Assembly that legislation contained
                    in the telecommunications provisions of Part II of this act makes no substantive policy changes from the statutes repealed. The North Carolina General Statutes Commission shall study the need for legislation to accomplish this intent
                    and shall report its findings and recommendations, including any legislative proposals, to the 2020 Regular Session of the 2019 General Assembly."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2019-111, s. 2.1(a)-(f), provides: "(a) The General Assembly finds that a coherent organization of the statutes that authorize local government planning and development regulation is needed to make the statutes simpler to find, easier to
                    follow, and more uniform for all local governments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) The General Assembly finds that the parallel system of separate city and county statutes regarding planning and development regulation has led to redundancy and unintended differences in the wording of planning and development regulation statutes
                    on the same subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(c) The General Assembly finds that numerous specialized statutes affecting local planning and development regulation have been added in disparate Chapters of the General Statutes over past decades, and that antiquated and confusing language exists in
                    the planning and development regulation statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(d) The General Assembly finds that, other than collecting some of these statutes into Article 19 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 160A</a></cite> of the General Statutes in 1971
                    and Article 18 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 153A</a></cite> of the General Statutes in 1973, no comprehensive reorganization of North Carolina's planning and development regulation
                    statutes has been undertaken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(e) The intent of the General Assembly by enactment of Part II of this act is to collect and organize existing statutes regarding local planning and development into a single Chapter of the General Statutes and to consolidate the statutes affecting cities
                    and counties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(f) The intent of the General Assembly by enactment of Part II of this act is to neither eliminate, diminish, enlarge, nor expand the authority of local governments to exact land, construction, or money as part of the development approval process or
                    otherwise materially alter the scope of local authority to regulate development and any modifications from earlier versions of Part II of this bill should not be interpreted to affect the scope of local government authority."

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2019-111, s. 2.9(a)-(c), provides: "(a) Any otherwise valid permit or development approval made prior to January 1, 2021, shall not be invalid based on inconsistency with the provisions of this act. The validity of any plan adopted prior
                    to January 1, 2021, is not affected by a failure to comply with the procedural requirements of G.S. 160D-5-1(b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) Any special use district or conditional use district zoning district that is valid and in effect as of January 1, 2021, shall be deemed a conditional zoning district consistent with the terms of this act, and the special or conditional use permits
                    issued concurrently with establishment of those districts shall be valid as specified in Section 2.9.(a) of this act. Any valid 'conditional use permit' issued prior to January 1, 2021, shall be deemed a 'special use permit' consistent
                    with the provisions of this act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(c) Any local government that has adopted zoning regulations but that has not adopted a comprehensive plan shall adopt such plan no later than July 1, 2022, in order to retain the authority to adopt and apply zoning regulations."

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2019-111, s. 3.2 provided for the delayed enactment of this Chapter, effective January 1, 2021, and applicable to local government development regulation decisions made on or after that date, and further provided that "Part II of this act
                    clarifies and restates the intent of existing law and applies to ordinances adopted before, on, and after the effective date." Session Laws 2020-3, s. 4.33(a), extended the delayed enactment date of this Article, making it effective
                    August 1, 2021, and applicable to local government development regulation decisions made on or after that date. Session Laws 2020-25, s. 51(a), (d), repealed Session Laws 2019-111, s. 3.2, and Session Laws 2020-3, s. 4.33, effective

                    A local government may elect to combine any of the regulations authorized by this Chapter into a unified ordinance. Unless expressly provided otherwise, a local government may apply any of the definitions and procedures authorized by law to any or all
                    aspects of the unified ordinance and may employ any organizational structure, board, commission, or staffing arrangement authorized by law to any or all aspects of the ordinance. Inclusion of a regulation authorized by this Chapter
                    or local act in a unified development ordinance does not expand, diminish, or alter the scope of authority for those regulations.

                        Findings. - The General Assembly recognizes that local government approval of development typically follows significant investment in site evaluation, planning, development costs, consultant fees, and related expenses. The General Assembly finds that
                        it is necessary and desirable to provide for the establishment of certain vested rights in order to ensure reasonable certainty, stability, and fairness in the development regulation process, to secure the reasonable expectations
                        of landowners, and to foster cooperation between the public and private sectors in land-use planning and development regulation. The provisions of this section and G.S. 160D-108.1 strike an appropriate balance between private expectations
                        and the public interest.

                        been challenged and found to be wrongfully denied or illegal, G.S. 143-755 applies.

                    The establishment of a vested right under any subdivision of this subsection does not preclude vesting under one or more other subdivisions of this subsection or vesting by application of common law principles. A vested right, once established as provided
                    for in this section or by common law, precludes any action by a local government that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property allowed by the applicable land development
                    regulation or regulations, except where a change in State or federal law mandating local government enforcement occurs after the development application is submitted that has a fundamental and retroactive effect on the development

                <p>
                    Except where a longer vesting period is provided by statute or land development regulation, the statutory vesting granted by this section, once established, expires for an uncompleted development project if development work is intentionally and voluntarily
                    discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months, and the statutory vesting period granted by this section for a nonconforming use of property expires if the use is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period
                    of not less than 24 consecutive months. The 24-month discontinuance period is automatically tolled during the pendency of any board of adjustment proceeding or civil action in a State or federal trial or appellate court regarding the
                    validity of a development permit, the use of the property, or the existence of the statutory vesting period granted by this section. The 24-month discontinuance period is also tolled during the pendency of any litigation involving
                    the development project or property that is the subject of the vesting.

                        Site-Specific Vesting Plan. - A site-specific vesting plan consists of a plan submitted to a local government in which the applicant requests vesting pursuant to this section, describing with reasonable certainty on the plan the type and intensity of
                        use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. The plan may be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans or approvals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a preliminary or general development
                        plan, a special use permit, a conditional district zoning plan, or any other land-use approval designation as may be utilized by a local government. Unless otherwise expressly provided by the local government, the plan shall include
                        the approximate boundaries of the site; significant topographical and other natural features affecting development of the site; the approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures, and other improvements;
                        the approximate dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways.
                        What constitutes a site-specific vesting plan under this section that would trigger a vested right shall be finally determined by the local government pursuant to a development regulation, and the document that triggers the vesting
                        shall be so identified at the time of its approval. A variance does not constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained does not confer a vested
                        right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it may not constitute
                        a site-specific vesting plan.

                    the terms and conditions of the approval will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. A local government shall not require a landowner to waive the landowner's vested rights as a condition of developmental approval. A site-specific
                    vesting plan is deemed approved upon the effective date of the local government's decision approving the plan or another date determined by the governing board upon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions
                    may be amended with the approval of the owner and the local government as follows: any substantial modification must be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the original approval; minor modifications may be approved by staff,
                    if such are defined and authorized by local regulation.

                            Procedures of Article 18 Did Not Apply to County Sign Ordinance - The enactment of the Sign Control Ordinance of Transylvania County, North Carolina, was a valid exercise of the general police power of Transylvania County, North Carolina, under

                            The obvious purpose of the statutory mandate in subsection (b) requiring that boundaries be defined in terms of geographical features identifiable on the ground is that boundaries be defined, to the extent feasible, so that owners of property outside
                            the city can easily and accurately ascertain whether their property is within the area over which the city exercises its extraterritorial zoning authority. Sellers v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite>                            544, 236 S.E.2d 283 (1977).

                        <p>
                            Interpretation. - Appellate court erred in affirming the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of a town in its action against a county to adopt a resolution authorizing its extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) expansion because there was no
                            irreconcilable conflict between the subsections of the subject statute, and while the statute, as amended in 1999, allowed the town to extend its ETJ up to two miles beyond its corporate limits, the town was prohibited from
                            doing so into the subject area since the county had adopted and was enforcing a zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, was enforcing the State Building Code, and did not approve the requested resolution. Town of Pinebluff

                            Standing to Contest Annexation Scheme of Neighboring Town. - Section 160A-31 describes a voluntary annexation undertaken at the request of land owners and does not authorize suit by neighboring municipalities; only if another town owned property in the
                            annexed area, or if both towns were simultaneously attempting to annex controverted property, could there be a justiciable controversy, giving one town standing to contest the annexation by the other, and, even then, this section
                            provides a way to resolve such a conflict. Town of Ayden v. Town of Winterville, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 544 S.E.2d 821 (2001).

                            Standing to Contest City's Attempt to Exercise Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. - Trial court properly dismissed the claims brought by a county and the county commissioners in their official capacities challenging a city's attempt to exercise extraterritorial
                            jurisdiction because the county had stated no legal or factual basis for its claim that its tax base and planning jurisdiction would be affected by the city exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction, and the commissioners acknowledged
                            that they were not the real parties in interest; thus, neither the county nor the commissioners were the real parties in interest. Macon County v. Town of Highlands, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite>                            752, 654 S.E.2d 17 (2007).

                            County Lacked Discretion to Disapprove Requests Regarding Exercise of Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. - G.S 160A-360(f), as modified by 1999 N.C. Sess. Laws 35, is clear: Moore County does not retain the discretion to disapprove of Pinebluff's requests
                            to exercise its extraterritorial jurisdiction within the two-mile limit authorized by the alteration to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa19s160A-360ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-360(a)</a></cite>;

                        <p>
                            Town Not Exempt from Description Requirements. - By enacting Session Laws 1973, c. 131, which provided that Town of Lake Waccamaw "may exercise the powers set forth" in this section, et seq. within one mile of the town limits and within 2,000 feet of
                            Lake Waccamaw's high water mark, the legislature did not exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction on behalf of Lake Waccamaw, but merely permitted it to be done. Therefore, the Town of Lake Waccamaw was not exempted thereby from
                            the description requirements of subsection (b) of this section. Town of Lake Waccamaw v. Savage, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 211, 356 S.E.2d 810, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 797</cite>,

                        <p>
                            County Zoning Ordinance Did Not Preclude Town's Extension. - Town was not precluded from extending its extraterritorial jurisdiction pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa19s160A-360ol1e" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-360(e)</a></cite>                            because an earlier county ordinance did not extend zoning into the proposed area under G.S. 153A-344(a), and a subsequent county zoning ordinance was enacted arbitrarily and capriciously under G.S. 153A-340(a) and G.S. 153A-341.

                            Definition of Boundaries Held Not to Comply with Subsection (b). - Extraterritorial jurisdiction ordinance exacted by town, which defined extraterritorial boundaries by reference to a map showing the boundaries drawn in sweeping curves around town limits
                            and lake, did not comply with the description requirements of subsection (b) of this section. Town of Lake Waccamaw v. Savage, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 211, 356 S.E.2d 810, cert.

                            Definiteness in Boundary Descriptions Not Met. - The boundaries of a city's proposed extraterritorial zone failed to meet the degree of definiteness mandated by subsection (b) where the only description merely referred to "the territory beyond the corporate
                            limits for a distance of one mile in all directions" and the map showed the "mile boundary" drawn in sweeping curves. Sellers v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 544,

                        <p>
                            Failure to Record Descriptions Not Fatal. - The city substantially complied with this section although it failed to timely record the map or written description of the ordinance in which it exercised extraterritorial jurisdiction; therefore, the plaintiff-store
                            owner was barred from attacking the validity of the ordinance based on procedural grounds by the statute of limitations provided in G.S. 160A-364.1. Potter v. City of Hamlet, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite>                            714, 541 S.E.2d 233, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 379</cite>, 547 S.E.2d 814 (2001).

                        <p>
                            Adult Business Ordinance Held Vague. - Because a county's adult business ordinance was ambiguous as to whether it applied to businesses outside a city's business limits or only to businesses outside the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, it was interpreted
                            as applying only to the latter. State v. Baggett, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 47, 514 S.E.2d 536 (1999).

                        <p>
                            Zoning Ordinance Held Void. - Plaintiff town did not satisfy requirements of this section and G.S. 160A-364 where its notice of a public hearing failed to apprise defendants, or any other property owners within the affected area, of the nature and character
                            of proposed actions to exert extra-territorial jurisdiction, failed to describe in any way the area in question, and failed to comport with the clear requirements of G.S. 160A-364 in that it was not published in two successive
                            calendar weeks, and where, furthermore, plaintiff's ordinance was adopted in a proceeding held over eight months subsequent to its initial hearing, and without either further public hearing or notice, and plaintiff never recorded
                            a boundary description as required by subsection (b) of this section; therefore, the court correctly ruled plaintiff's extraterritorial zoning ordinance void and ineffective as against defendants. Town of Swansboro v. Odum,

                        may exercise these powers over an area extending not more than two miles beyond its limits and a city of 25,000 or more population may exercise these powers over an area extending not more than three miles beyond its limits. In
                        determining the population of a city for the purposes of this Chapter, the city council and the board of county commissioners may use the most recent annual estimate of population as certified by the Secretary of the North Carolina

                        Amendment to county zoning ordinance constituted a valid legislative prerogative to change the sanitary landfill use from a "special use permit" category to a "use by right under prescribed conditions" category and that section of the county zoning ordinance,

                        Building Permits. - Plaintiffs had a valid building permit because their appeal of the order that prevented them from building tolled the statutory time period in which plaintiffs could resume construction under their office building permit; however,
                        the building permit only authorized the construction of an office building it did not establish a statutory vested right to mine the property. Sandy Mush Props. v.

                        Spot Zoning. - Because it zones a small area differently than a much larger area surrounding it, spot zoning, by definition, conflicts with the whole purpose of planned zoning. Therefore, unless there is a clear showing of a reasonable basis, spot zoning
                        is beyond the authority of the county or municipality. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 211, 354 S.E.2d 309 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>,

                        Clear Showing of Reasonable Basis for Spot Zoning. - While the rezoning of two tracts from A-1 to CU-M-2, so as to allow the storage and sale of agricultural chemicals, constituted a form of spot zoning, this activity was legal and not illegal spot zoning.
                        Because of the substantial benefits created for the surrounding community by the rezoning and because of the close relationship between the likely uses of the rezoned property and the uses already present in the surrounding tracts,
                        there was a clear showing of a reasonable basis for the spot zoning. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Rezoning. - It is not necessary that property rezoned to a conditional use district be available for all of the uses allowed under the corresponding general use district. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>,
                        370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Rezoning lacks a permissible basis where it is done on consideration of assurances that a particular tract or parcel will be developed in accordance with restricted approval plans. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite>                        211, 354 S.E.2d 309 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Rezoning Held Valid Conditional Use Zoning. - The rezoning of two tracts of land from A-1 to CU-M-2 so as to allow the storage and sale of agricultural chemicals was valid conditional use zoning and not illegal contract zoning. Chrismon v. Guilford County,
                        <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                    <p>
                        As the board of commissioners' enactment of a rezoning ordinance was a legislative act reviewable under the "whole record" test, the trial court erred in considering evidence outside the record of the rezoning process. Kerik v. Davidson County,
                        <cite

                        Changes in Zoning Classifications Held Invalid. - Changes in zoning classification were never considered by the Planning Board but were instead handled by the planning staff, which meant that the approved 404 changes in zoning violated G.S. 153A-344;
                        this violation, among other violations, provided a basis for declaring the Buncombe County, N.C. Amended Zoning Ordinance invalid. The language of G.S. 153A-344 was mandatory, not discretionary. Thrash Ltd. P'ship v. County of

                            Zoning Administrator's Duties Regarding Appeals. - Zoning administrator was bound to transmit petitioner's appeal to the county board of adjustment and whether petitioner had standing fell within the province of the board, and thus mandamus relief was
                            proper; the statute does not establish any exception or other circumstances in which the officer may decline to transmit the appropriate materials, and thus it was mandatory that the administrator immediately transmit the appeal
                            to the board, as the statute was not intended to permit zoning officers to block appeals from their own zoning determinations. Morningstar Marinas/Eaton Ferry, LLC v. Warren Cnty., <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 360</cite>,

                            Appellate Jurisdiction of Board. - Subsection (b) of this section clearly confers on the board only appellate jurisdiction, as distinguished from original jurisdiction, to decide whether a particular use is permitted under the zoning ordinance. Tate v.

                            Absent any indication that city zoning enforcement officials had made a decision whether petitioners' use of pool on their property in conjunction with child care center was permitted or not, the board of adjustment lacked jurisdiction to decide such
                            question. Tate v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 512, 350 S.E.2d 873 (1986).

                            In reviewing the determination of an administrative enforcement officer that a sawmill on residential property violated a city ordinance, city's board of adjustment only had the authority to reverse, affirm, or modify the officer's determination that
                            the owner's use of the sawmill violated the zoning ordinance, and the board did not have the authority to rule on the owner's constitutional challenges to the validity of the zoning ordinance itself. Dobo v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment,

                            Amelioration of General Zoning Regulations Intended. - The plain intent and purpose of former G.S. 160-178 was to permit, through the board of adjustment, the amelioration of the rigors of necessarily general zoning regulations by eliminating the necessity
                            for a slavish adherence to the precise letter of the regulations where, in a given case, little or no good on the one side and undue hardship on the other would result from a literal enforcement. Lee v. Board of Adjustment,

                            The board is not a law-making body and has no power to amend a zoning ordinance either to permit the construction of a building prohibited by ordinance or to prohibit the construction of one permitted by ordinance. In re Rea Constr. Co.,

                            No legislative authority in board of adjustment. - Former G.S. 160-172 and 160-178 did not grant board of adjustment legislative authority, and therefore, board was without power to amend an ordinance under which it functioned. Lee v. Board of Adjustment,
                            <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 107</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 128 (1946).

                            The legislative body may not delegate to the municipal board of adjustment the power to zone. Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 17</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 616 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It would constitute an unlawful delegation of the legislative power vested by the General Assembly in a board of aldermen to allow the board of adjustment to deny a special permit on the ground that the board of adjustment did not consider a use specified
                            in the ordinance as a conditional permissible use to be in accord with the "purpose and intent" of the ordinance. Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 17</cite>,
                            178 S.E.2d 616 (1971).

                        <p>
                            In exercising discretion, board of adjustment must abide by the rules provided by the local ordinance enacted in accord with and by permission of the State zoning law. Jackson v. Guilford County Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite>                            408, 163 S.E.2d 265 (1968), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 155</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 78 (1969).

                            Rule which demands that a board of adjustment consistently follow its procedural rules is equally applicable to a case involving a variance; therefore, where the board of adjustment rules then applicable stated that an application for rehearing "shall
                            be denied by the board if in its judgment there has been no substantial change in the facts, evidence or conditions in the case," the board violated its own procedural rules when it agreed to rehear application for a variance,
                            since it was clear that there had been no change in the "facts, evidence or conditions in the case." Kirby v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 182, 381 S.E.2d 889, cert.

                            Reduction of Terms. - If a board of adjustment is created, then it must consist of at least five appointees, each with three-year terms. Such terms may not be reduced by the city council as long as the board of adjustment is in existence. However, the
                            prohibition against the reduction of the length of the terms of the members of an existing board of adjustment does not diminish the authority of the city council to abolish the board. Board of Adjustment v. Town of Swansboro,

                            The board of adjustment is clothed, if not with judicial, at least with quasi-judicial power; it being its duty to investigate facts and from its investigation to draw conclusions as a basis of official action, and to exercise discretion of a judicial
                            nature. Harden v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 395</cite>, 135 S.E. 151 (1926); In re Markham, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 566</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 329, cert. denied, 375 U.S.

                            The principal function of a board of adjustment is to issue variance permits so as to prevent injustice by a strict application of the ordinance. In re Rea Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 715</cite>, 158 S.E.2d

                            Board of adjustment cannot permit type of business or building prohibited by zoning ordinance, for to do so would be an amendment of law and not a variance of its regulations. Lee v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 107</cite>,

                            Board of Adjustment Can Merely "Vary" Regulations. - The board of adjustment cannot disregard the provisions of the enabling act or regulations enacted in accordance with zoning law, but can merely "vary" them to prevent injustice when the strict letter
                            of the provisions would work "unnecessary hardship." Lee v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 107</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 128 (1946); In re Markham, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 566</cite>,

                            Issuance of Special Permit on Making of Specified Findings Not Unlawful Exercise of Power. - Where a municipal ordinance required the board of adjustment to issue a special use permit when it made certain affirmative findings specified in the ordinance,
                            the board's determination of whether to issue a special use permit was not an unlawful exercise of legislative power. Kenan v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 688,

                            Standing to Challenge Zoning Ordinance. - A corporation which did not have any legal interest in property affected by a zoning ordinance did not have standing to challenge that zoning ordinance when only twelve of its 114 members the members/shareholders
                            had standing as individuals to challenge the zoning ordinance. Northeast Concerned Citizens, Inc. v. City of Hickory, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 545 S.E.2d 768 (2001).

                            Where an owner was granted a special use permit to operate a paintball playing field on the owner's property, the adjoining neighbors lacked standing to appeal the grant of the permit, as their mere averment that they owned land in the immediate vicinity
                            of the subject property, absent an allegation of special damages distinct from the rest of the community, was insufficient to confer standing upon them. Sarda v. City/ Durham Bd. of Adjustment,

                            as by certiorari or mandamus, or by pursuit of a statutory remedy. Michael v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 515</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 106 (1967) (decided under former G.S. 153A-345).

                            Nonconforming building or use that conflicts with general purpose or spirit of zoning ordinance can only be authorized by the board of aldermen acting in their legislative capacity to rezone, not under the guise of a variance permit. Sherrill v. Town

                            No Authority to Permit Duplexes by Variance in R-1 Area. - As the purpose of an R-1 designation is to limit density, while the purpose and effect of a duplex is to increase density, variance requested by petitioners, who sought to build duplexes in R-1
                            areas, was directly contrary to the zoning ordinance; in these circumstances the board of adjustment had no legal authority under subsection (d) of this section to grant the requested variance, and thus there was no need for
                            it to make findings on the merits of the request. Sherrill v. Town of Wrightsville Beach, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 646, 334 S.E.2d 103 (1985).

                            Safeguards against arbitrary action by zoning boards in granting or denying special use permits are not only to be found in specific guidelines for their action. Equally important are the requirements that in each instance the board (1) follow the procedures
                            specified in the ordinance; (2) conduct its hearings in accordance with fair-trial standards; (3) base its findings of fact only upon competent, material, and substantial evidence; and (4) in allowing or denying the application,
                            state the basic facts on which it relied with sufficient specificity to inform the parties, as well as the court, what induced its decision. Humble Oil &amp; Ref. Co. v. Board of Aldermen,

                            Where one asserts a legal right to a nonconforming use, whether he has such legal right depends upon factual findings, and in the determination of such factual findings unsworn statements may not be considered either competent or substantial. Jarrell

                            work as a bar when the claimant knew of the existence of the grounds for the claim. There was no showing that petitioner knew of grounds for appeal before letter of August 10, 1989. Allen v. City of Burlington Bd. of Adjustment,

                            burial facilities relates to the process by which the nonconforming activity is conducted and does not amount to a change in the nature and kind of use to which the property was devoted. Stegall v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment,

                            Right to a special exception permit cannot be made to hinge upon whether the board considers proposed structure beneficial or harmful to the community. Such power would subject the board to the pressures of individuals or groups who, for an infinite variety
                            of reasons, might oppose the permit, and enable it to make a different rule of law in every case. Statute empowering the commissioners to authorize the board of adjustment to permit special exceptions in the classes of cases
                            or situations and in accordance with the principles, conditions, safeguards, and procedures specified in the ordinance does not purport to confer such unbridled discretion upon it. In re Ellis,

                            a sign ordinance constituted an error of law as the term "work" had a broader meaning than mere visible evidence of construction. The company took multiple steps to lawfully relocate its sign within the six month period prescribed
                            in its sign permit as the company, during the six month period following the issuance of the sign permit, communicated with a state agency about removing the sign, started renegotiating a lease, and secured a building permit.

                            Superior court, pursuant to G.S. 153A-345(e) (now repealed), properly affirmed a county board of adjustment's approval of a special use permit to allow a park owner to build and operate a go-cart track because (1) the board properly placed the burden
                            of proof on the park owner to prove that the health and safety requirements of the county's special use permit ordinance were met; and (2) the findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by competent, material, and
                            substantial evidence in the record as a whole, based on the testimony of a civil engineer as to sound levels and the sound test results from an engineering firm. Harding v. Bd. of Adjustment,

                            Board's Action Vacated. - Superior court properly vacated a special use permit issued by a county zoning board of adjustment because the county and the abutting landowners were denied due process by the board's failure to comply with hearing procedures
                            as set forth in a county zoning ordinance. Cook v. Union County Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 649 S.E.2d 458 (2007) (decided under former G.S. 153A-345).

                            County Zoning Board Exceeded Its Delegated Authority. - County zoning board exceeded its authority when it voided a mine operator's special use exception permit after finding violations, then treated the mine operator's current permit application as one
                            for a new permit and applied the standard under a new ordinance; instead of voiding the original permit, which was issued in 1997, the board should have considered the application in light of the standards in effect prior to
                            October of 2000, the date of the new ordinance, and had the board done so, it should have found that the mine operator met the burden when the mine operator produced a current permit from the Department of Environment, Health,
                            and Natural Resources, Division of Land Resources for the activities contemplated and the 1997 ordinance had no other, more stringent conditions specified. Hewett v.

                            Constitutional Sufficiency of Review. - City tax collector's zoning decision to deny a business privilege license application was immediately appealable to the city zoning board of adjustment, and the board's decision could be reviewed in superior court
                            upon the filing of a petition for certiorari; the judicial relief provided in G.S. 160A-388 was constitutionally sufficient because the license applicant was afforded the possibility of sufficiently prompt judicial review.

                            landowners, filed 322 days after the officer issued the certificate of zoning compliance, was not taken within a reasonable time. See Teen Challenge Training Center, Inc. v. Board of Adjustment,

                            Quasi-judicial functions, when exercised, not arbitrarily, but in subordination to a uniform rule prescribed by statute, ordinarily are not subject to judicial control. It is only in extreme cases, those which are arbitrary, oppressive, or attended with

                            Exhaustion of Remedies. - In a case concerning restrictive covenants, because a side setback requirement was an issue directly related to the issuance of a zoning permit, an appeal should have first been filed with a board of adjustment in order to exhaust
                            administrative remedies. Having failed to exhaust administrative remedies, a trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction to rule on a request for a writ of mandamus. Sanford v. Williams,

                            Superior court erred in affirming a county board of adjustment's order because the board improperly concluded that a property owner was in violation of an ordinance; the board improperly concluded that under the amended ordinance, a change in ownership
                            constituted a change in use and that the owner was required to amend its zoning permit to legally continue the same use of the property because the change of ownership had no impact on the use of the property. Starlites Tech

                            Deficient Record on Appeal. - Property owner's appeal of a trial court's judgment upholding the decision of a board of adjustment finding that a limitation on a prior agreement allowing access to a developer's adjacent parcel across the owner's land was
                            void for lack of board approval was dismissed because it could not be determined from the record on appeal if a zoning ordinance in effect when the development plan in issue was approved was superseded by a subsequent zoning
                            ordinance, so the record was deficient, under N.C. R. App. P. 9(a)(2)(e), as the record did not contain all items properly before the trial court that were necessary to decide the errors assigned. CRLP Durham, LP v. Durham

                            Record Was Adequate. - Record a city provided to the trial court did not deprive homeowners of their right to due process because the record adequately conveyed the substance of the homeowners' missing audio testimony; the record included a copy of the
                            homeowners' appeal, which appeal included inter an affidavit from one of them, and the homeowners did not specifically identify any other competent or substantial evidence that could be missing and that would have prevented
                            the trial court from reviewing their claim. Fehrenbacher v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 768 S.E.2d 186 (2015).

                            Scope of Judicial Review. - The task of a court reviewing a decision made by a town board sitting as a quasi-judicial body on an application for a conditional use permit includes: (1) reviewing the record for errors in law; (2) insuring that procedures
                            specified by law in both statute and ordinance are followed; (3) insuring that appropriate due process rights of a petitioner are protected, including the right to offer evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to inspect
                            documents; (4) insuring that the decision of the town board is supported by competent, material and substantial evidence in the whole record; and (5) insuring that the decision is not arbitrary and capricious. Both the superior

                            In reviewing zoning decisions, the superior court is not the trier of fact; it sits in the posture of an appellate court. There is no necessity for, or entitlement to, a jury trial. Mize v. County of Mecklenburg, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                            279, 341 S.E.2d 767 (1986) (decided under former G.S. 153A-345).

                            On review of zoning board decision, it was incumbent on the trial court to insure that the board's decision was not contrary to State law and was authorized by local ordinance; and if the ABC Commission had rendered a statutorily authorized decision contrary
                            to the board's decision to deny petitioner's special exception permit request, then it was necessary for the trial court to consider the question of whether the board's decision was contrary to State law. Melkonian v. Board

                            Improper Standard of Review Applied. - Board's determination that a company's facility did not constitute a vocational school was proper given that the facility did not teach a skill or trade, but instead provided training to existing members of a profession
                            to refine their skills, and because the zoning ordinance failed to specifically prohibit the use of land as a firing range, it was allowed as a use by right pursuant to the ordinance; the trial court improperly applied de novo
                            review and erred by reversing the board's conclusion that the facility did not fall within the classification of a vocational school. Fort v. County of Cumberland, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. App.</cite>                            541, 761 S.E.2d 744 (2014).

                            Power to review. - The superior court, pursuant to a writ of certiorari under subsection (e), only has the power to review the issue of whether a permit was properly granted or denied.

                            In reviewing the city board of adjustment's affirmance of an administrative enforcement officer decision that a sawmill on residential property violated a city ordinance, the superior court had the statutory power to review only the issue of whether the
                            officer's determination was properly affirmed, and did not have the statutory authority to address the owner's constitutional challenges to the validity of the zoning ordinance. Dobo v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment,

                            Because petitioners did not appeal the decision of a board of adjustment to deny the appeal of the revocation of a sign permit, the board's determination that the permit was issued in error and properly revoked was the law of the case, and the parties
                            were bound by the decision; because petitioners did not appeal the board's decision, they were bound by the decision and could not assert that the town was barred by estoppel or laches from revoking the permit. Premier Plastic

                            The inquiry on review upon writ of certiorari under this section is whether the board committed an error of law or whether an order of the board is arbitrary, oppressive or attended with manifest abuse of authority. Teen Challenge Training Center, Inc.

                            Superior Court Not the Trier of Fact. - On review of the sufficiency and competency of the evidence at the appellate level, the question is not whether the evidence before the superior court supported that court's order, but whether the evidence before
                            the town board was supportive of its action. In proceedings of this nature, the superior court is not the trier of fact. Such is the function of the town board. Coastal Ready-Mix Concrete Co. v. Board of Comm'rs,

                            Findings of Fact Necessary. - Findings of fact are an important safeguard against arbitrary and capricious action by the board of adjustment because they establish a sufficient record upon which the appellate court can review the board's decision. Crist

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred in concluding that a board of adjustment made sufficient findings of facts to support its denial of petitioners' application for a variance because the board's findings of fact lacked the specificity necessary for the court of appeals
                            to determine whether the board had acted arbitrarily or had committed errors of law; the board's findings presented no reasoning, were conclusory statements, and were not supported by any evidence in the record but were mere
                            conjecture. Premier Plastic Surgery Ctr., PLLC v. Bd. of Adjustment for Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 713 S.E.2d 511 (2011).

                            Whole Record Test. - Because the trial court was reviewing whether the board's decision that the facility's impacts were most similar to recreation/amusement, the court should have applied the whole record test. Fort v. County of Cumberland,

                            Review of Questions of Fact. - The writ of certiorari is a writ to bring the matter before the court, upon the evidence presented by the record itself, for review of alleged errors of law. It does not lie to review questions of fact to be determined by
                            evidence outside the record. In re Pine Hill Cemeteries, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 735</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 1 (1941). See Lee v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 107</cite>,

                            an unlawful expansion of a non-conforming use pursuant to the requirements of this section, and who instead filed a rezoning petition requesting that his property be rezoned from I-2 to B-3, failed to avail himself of the only
                            judicial review authorized by statute and could not collaterally attack the determination of the zoning officer by appeal to the court. Potter v.

                            should have allowed owner to attack ordinance directly; owner stated direct attack on ordinance so long as she could show that attack was timely under G.S. 153A-348. White v. Union County,

                            Review Limited to Whether Variance Properly Denied Absent Challenge to Validity of Ordinance. - Upon denial of a variance by the board of aldermen, sitting in their quasi-judicial capacity as the board of adjustment, the superior court, and hence the
                            Court of Appeals through its derivative appellate jurisdiction, had the statutory power to review only the issue of whether the variance was properly denied. The constitutionality of the zoning ordinance was a separate issue
                            not properly a part of these proceedings, since the denial of the variance request never addressed the validity of the zoning ordinance, and since the superior court sat in the posture of an appellate court, so that it was
                            not in a position to address constitutional issues that were not before the board. Sherrill v. Town of Wrightsville Beach, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 646, 334 S.E.2d 103 (1985).

                            In order to seek review of board of adjustment decisions made under zoning ordinances, petitioners must be aggrieved persons within the meaning of this section. This means only that the appealing party must have some interest in the property affected.

                            vicinity of the subject property, absent an allegation of special damages distinct from the rest of the community, was insufficient to confer standing upon them. Sarda v. City/ Durham Bd. of Adjustment,

                            an appeal was permitted; moreover, the abutting landowners to the subject property, upon which a retailer intended to build a large store, had standing because they suffered special damages to their properties that were unique

                            future operating costs because the testimony indicated that the new equipment would significantly decrease operating costs and enable the plant to operate more efficiently, and that testimony was sufficient to support a finding
                            that the new equipment would enlarge the plant's commercial viability; Board did not err by considering the plant's commercial viability in concluding that the proposed modifications would expand or enlarge the non-conforming

                            Expansion of Non-Conforming Use. - Superior court did not err in affirming the finding of a Board of Adjustment that an applicant's proposed modifications to its asphalt plant would expand or enlarge the non-conforming use pursuant to City of Salisbury,
                            N.C. Land Development Ordinance,

                            Because a Board of Adjustment did not err by concluding that an applicant's proposed modifications to its asphalt plant constituted an expansion or enlargement of the applicant's non-conforming use, the proposed modifications would be impermissible. APAC-Atlantic,

                            Grant of Variance Affirmed. - Town of Surf City board of adjustment's decision to grant a variance of approximately 7.2 inches to property owners was based upon competent evidence and was not arbitrary or capricious because: (1) there was sufficient evidence
                            to support the board's finding that literal enforcement of the Surf City, N.C. Zoning Ordinance would result in an unnecessary hardship for the owners; (2) the variance would allow the owners to continue their construction
                            project that was started only after obtaining a legitimate construction permit; (3) there was no indication that granting the variance would harm neighboring properties or structures, and would not give any special privileges
                            to the owners; (4) the board followed the procedures for granting a variance as outlined in the ordinance; and (5) the owners followed the necessary procedures to obtain a building permit before they began construction on their
                            property and the hardship that they faced was not one of their own making. Turik v. Town of Surf City, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 642 S.E.2d 251 (2007).

                            Review of Denial of Subdivision Application. - Denial of a property owner's subdivision application was properly reversed because the property owner complied with the general and technical requirements of the town's subdivision ordinance since substantial
                            evidence did not support findings regarding overcrowding of schools, increased traffic, and incompatibility with the existing neighborhood; also, remand for clarification of subjective criteria in the ordinance was reasonable.

                            Appeal rights do not resurface simply because a use which has been found to be permissible on the property is being expanded. Any challenge to this expansion would have to be based on factors other than use. Allen v. City of Burlington Bd. of Adjustment,

                            Proper Review at Appellate Level Considers Whether Evidence Before Town Board Was Supportive of Its Action. - In reviewing sufficiency and competency of the evidence at the appellate level, the question is not whether the evidence before the superior
                            court supported that court's order, but whether the evidence before, the town board was supportive of its action. Coulter v. City of Newton, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 397 S.E.2d

                            of the case; rather, the request was made (1) orally, (2) to counsel who had represented the village in the hearing, and (3) on the day after the hearing concluded. McCrann v. Vill. of Pinehurst,

                            Insufficient Pleadings. - In action to contest decision of town board of adjustment issuing special exception permit for expansion of present nonconforming building, allegation that landowner was the "owner of adjoining property" did not satisfy the pleading
                            requirement, in that there was no allegation relating to whether and in what respect landowner's land would be adversely affected by the board's issuance of the special exception permit. Kentallen, Inc. v. Town of Hillsborough,

                            Time for Appeal. - The fact that the town planner failed to inform the landowner of its right to appeal a zoning decision did not preclude enforcement of the town's 30-day limitation period for filing an appeal, where the planner's letter was silent,
                            but the landowner was presumed to know the law governing such appeals. Water Tower Office Assocs. v. Town of Cary Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 696, 507 S.E.2d 589

                            Trial court did not err in denying residents' petition for review of a village's decision to issue a corporation a special use zoning permit because the petition was not timely filed under G.S. 160A-388(e2); the residents did not file their petition until
                            31 days after the order granting the permit was filed, and they did not file a written request for such copy with the secretary or chairman of the board of adjustment at the time of its hearing of the case, which would have
                            tolled the start of the 30-day filing period until their receipt of a copy of the order. McCrann v. Vill. of Pinehurst, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 716 S.E.2d 667 (2011).

                            Village and a corporation were not estopped from asserting G.S. 160A-388(e2) as a bar to residents' petition for judicial review of the village's decision to issue the corporation a special use permit because resident's failed to assert the essential
                            elements of estoppel; the residents did not argue that the cooperative interactions of the village and the corporation with the residents concealed or misrepresented the requirements of G.S. 160A-388(e2) or were undertaken
                            in order to dupe the residents into filing their petition outside the permitted time period. McCrann v. Vill. of Pinehurst, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 716 S.E.2d 667 (2011).

                        <p>
                            Superior court properly dismissed a land owner's amended petition for judicial review under writ of certiorari because the town, and not the town's board of adjustment, was statutorily required to be named as the respondent in the owner's petition for
                            judicial review, the owner's initial petition failed to name the town, while his amended petition named the town, it was filed long after the 30-day statute of limitations for appealing such decisions, and the owner's amended
                            petition did not relate back to his initial petition inasmuch as the town did not waived his failure to name it as the respondent in his initial petition by participating in the hearing on the board of adjustment's motion to
                            dismiss. Azar v. Town of Indian Trail Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 809 S.E.2d 17 (2017).

                        <p>
                            Appeal Held Timely. - The trial court erred by affirming the Board of Adjustment's determination that petitioner was time-barred from bringing appeal, relying on local ordinance and laches. Burlington Zoning Ordinance G.S. 32.15(H) provided that appeals
                            were to be taken within a "reasonable time." Reasonable was not defined. In making a determination of what is reasonable, the time begins to run when a party has actual or constructive notice of the zoning decision. There is
                            no evidence that petitioner had actual notice of the building inspector's decision until letter of August 10, 1989. Petitioner appealed this decision on September 8, 1989, within a reasonable period. Allen v. City of Burlington

                            Remand, Not Granting Variance, Was Proper. - Although denial of an owner's request for a variance was improper, the proper course was for the trial court to remand the case to the board, not to grant the variance. Stealth Props., LLC v. Town of Pinebluff

                            "Aggrieved Party" Defined. - An aggrieved party is one who can either show an interest in the property affected, or if the party is a nearby property owner, some special damage, distinct from the rest of the community, amounting to a reduction in the
                            value of his property. Allen v. City of Burlington Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 615, 397 S.E.2d 657 (1990).

                            An aggrieved party is one who either shows a legal interest in the property affected or, in the case of a nearby property owner, shows some special damage, distinct from the rest of the community, amounting to a reduction in value of the owner's property.

                            Petitioner Held to Be "Aggrieved Party". - Board of Adjustment's determination that petitioner was not an aggrieved person was not supported by evidence in the record where: the record revealed competent evidence of such special damages through petitioner's
                            own testimony; respondents' expert testified in general terms about the neighborhood and his opinion as to the appropriateness of the proposed uses in the area; and nothing in his testimony could reasonably be concluded to
                            negative petitioner's testimony about his property. Allen v. City of Burlington Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 615, 397 S.E.2d 657 (1990).

                            Trial court did not err in allowing neighboring property owners to intervene in a developer's appeal from a determination that property sought to be developed was in a Conservation Overlay District, because the intervenors alleged that development of
                            the property without the performance controls required of property associated with a Conservation Overlay District would significantly increase traffic, light pollution, noise and other related pollution that will all lead

                            Superior court properly exercised its scope of review in affirming a decision by a city zoning board of adjustment to affirm the denial of a business privilege license by a city tax collector for a sexually oriented business that sought to operate in

                            Appealable Controversy. - Pursuant to G.S. 160A-388(b), the controversy surrounding a town historic preservation commission's denial of a developer's design application remained after the application was denied because the issuance of a certificate of
                            appropriateness by the commission was not dependent upon the issuance of a zoning certificate. Meares v. Town of Beaufort, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 667 S.E.2d 239 (2008).

                            Upon de novo review, the appellate court found that the superior court erred when it dismissed the appeal of town residents, the country club residents, the architects, and the development team members under G.S. 160A-381(c) and G.S. 160A-388 pursuant

                        Appointment. - Membership of joint municipal-county planning agencies or boards of adjustment may be appointed as agreed by counties and cities. The extraterritorial representatives on a city advisory board authorized by this Article shall be appointed
                        by the board of county commissioners with jurisdiction over the area. The county shall make the appointments within 90 days following the receipt of a request from the city that the appointments be made. Once a city provides proportional
                        representation, no power available to a city under this Chapter is ineffective in its extraterritorial area solely because county appointments have not yet been made. If there is an insufficient number of qualified residents of
                        the extraterritorial area to meet membership requirements, the board of county commissioners may appoint as many other residents of the county as necessary to make up the requisite number. When the extraterritorial area extends
                        into two or more counties, each board of county commissioners concerned shall appoint representatives from its portion of the area, as specified in the ordinance. If a board of county commissioners fails to make these appointments
                        within 90 days after receiving a resolution from the city council requesting that they be made, the city council may make them.

                            Hearing and Opportunity to Present Views Intended. - The manifest intention of the General Assembly was that a public hearing be conducted at which those who opposed and those who favored adoption of the ordinance would have a fair opportunity to present
                            their respective views. Freeland v. Orange County, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 452</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 282 (1968); Orange County v. Heath, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 688</cite>, 180 S.E.2d

                            Standing. - Owner had standing to challenge the Buncombe County, N.C. Multi-Family Dwelling Ordinance (Ordinance) because the owner's attack on the Ordinance was not an "as-applied" challenge, but rather was an attack on the county's failure to comply
                            with G.S. 153A-323 in enacting the ordinance; thus, the owner's challenge was an attack on the Ordinance's procedural enactment, the owner's use of its land was limited by the zoning regulations, and the owner had standing.

                            after the county was enjoined from enforcing a moratorium on the issuance of building permits in the same area, (2) the moratorium was covered by N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 153A, art. 18 as it dealt with the issuance of building permits,
                            (3) the county could not avoid the notice requirements G.S. 153A-323, by stating that the moratorium was enacted pursuant to the police powers under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html#t153Aa06s153A-121" target="_blank">G.S. 153A-121</a></cite>,
                            and (4) although the county complied with the notice requirements before enacting the ordinance, the county had already been ordered to issue the building permit.

                            a zoning ordinance, and the county was not permitted to evade the legislative notice requirements imposed by G.S. 153A-323 by labeling the Ordinance an exercise of police power. Thrash Ltd. P'ship v. County of Buncombe,

                            Failure to Comply with Notice Requirements. - Where there was no notice to the public or advertised public hearing prior to adoption of the ordinance as required by this section; the trial court's conclusion that the ordinance passed by the board imposing
                            a moratorium on building permits pending zoning was invalid. Vulcan Materials Co. v. Iredell County, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 779, 407 S.E.2d 283 (1991).

                            A county ordinance that imposed a moratorium on the issuance of building permits dealing with the construction of heavy industry was invalid, because notice was not given once a week for two successive weeks before the public hearing on the ordinance
                            was held as was required under G.S. 153A-323, and instead notice was only published once. Sandy Mush Props., Inc. v. Rutherford County, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 586 S.E.2d

         G.S. 160A-364 plainly states that it is the "city council" that shall hold a public hearing and that it is notice of that public hearing which must be given;

                            were not in compliance with this section, since they failed adequately to alert owners of property outside the city that their rights might be affected. Sellers v.

                            Amendment to a town's development ordinance, which would have prohibited convenience stores in certain zoning districts, was invalid under G.S. 160A-364 and under the development ordinance itself because the pre-adoption notice did not satisfy requirements

                            of a public hearing failed to apprise defendants, or any other property owners within the affected area, of the nature and character of proposed actions to exert extraterritorial jurisdiction, failed to describe in any way
                            the area in question, and failed to comport with the clear requirements of this section in that it was not published in two successive calendar weeks, and where, furthermore, plaintiff's ordinance was adopted in a proceeding
                            held over eight months subsequent to its initial hearing, and without either further public hearing or notice, and plaintiff never recorded a boundary description as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa19s160A-360ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-360(b)</a></cite>;

                            The enactment of a zoning ordinance is not a contract with the property owners of the city and confers upon them no vested right to have the ordinance remain forever in force or to demand that the boundaries of each zone or the uses to be made of property
                            in each zone remain as declared in the original ordinance. Such legislation by the city may be repealed in its entirety, or amended as the city's legislative body determines from time to time to be in the best interests of
                            the public, subject only to the limitations of the enabling statute and the limitations of the Constitution. Zopfi v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 430</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 325

                            A comprehensive zoning ordinance does not constitute a contract between a municipality and the property owners which precludes the municipality from changing the boundaries if at a later date it deems a change to be desirable, nor does it vest in any
                            property owner the right that the restrictions imposed by it upon his property or the property of others should remain unaltered. Allgood v. Town of Tarboro, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 430</cite>,

                            A city may, from time to time, amend its zoning ordinance so as to transfer an area from one use district into another, since the enactment of a zoning ordinance is not a contract by the city with property owners to maintain the zoning pattern thereby
                            established. Blades v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 531</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 35 (1972).

                            A city's legislative body has authority to rezone property when it is reasonably necessary to do so in the interests of the public health, the public safety, the public morals or the public welfare. Ordinarily, the only limitation upon this legislative
                            authority is that it may not be exercised arbitrarily or capriciously. Allred v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 432 (1971).

                            Subject to Enabling Act and Constitutional Limitations. - Zoning regulations may be amended or changed when the action is authorized by the enabling statute and does not contravene constitutional limitations on the zoning power. Allgood v. Town of Tarboro,

                            A municipality's authority to enact and amend zoning ordinances is subject to the limitations imposed by the enabling statute and by the Constitution. These limitations forbid arbitrary and unduly discriminating interference with property rights in the
                            exercise of such power. Thus, a zoning ordinance or an amendment thereto which is not adopted in accordance with the enabling statute is invalid and ineffective. Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment,

                            Vested Rights Under Building Permit. - Issuance of a building permit creates no vested right to build contrary to the provisions of a subsequently enacted zoning ordinance, unless the permittee, acting in good faith, has made substantial expenditures
                            in reliance upon the permit at a time when they did not violate declared public policy. Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 715</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 175 (1972).

                        <p>
                            When, at the time a builder obtains a permit, he has knowledge of a pending ordinance which would make the authorized construction a nonconforming use and thereafter hurriedly makes expenditures in an attempt to acquire a vested right before the law can
                            be changed, he does not act in good faith and acquires no rights under the permit. Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 715</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 175 (1972).

                            in reliance on site plan approval and the issuance of building permit by town, and plaintiffs' efforts following the site plan approval were undertaken in good faith and under reasonable reliance on the validity of the approvals

                            City Legislative Body May Not Disregard Fundamental Concepts of Zoning. - Notwithstanding that the motivation of the members of a city legislative body may be laudable, any action of that body that disregards the fundamental concepts of zoning as set
                            forth in the enabling legislation may be arbitrary and capricious. Allred v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 432 (1971).

                            sufficient that the legislative body of the city had reasonable ground upon which to conclude that one or more of those purposes would be accomplished or aided by the amending ordinance. Zopfi v. City of Wilmington,

                            Tract Must Be Suitable for All Uses Permitted Under New Classification. - The zoning of a tract of land may be changed from a residential classification to a less restrictive residential classification only if and when its location and the surrounding
                            circumstances are such that the property should be made available for all uses permitted in the less restrictive district. Allred v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>, 178

                            Rezoning on consideration of assurances that a particular tract or parcel will be developed in accordance with restricted approved plans is not a permissible ground for placing the property in a zone where restrictions of the nature prescribed are not

                            The rezoning of residential property to a business use on condition that the land rezoned shall be devoted exclusively to the business use for which application to rezone was made, or otherwise remain residential, constitutes zoning without regard to
                            the public health, safety and welfare, concern for which is basic to that comprehensiveness contemplated in the enabling act. Allred v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>,

                            Determining Validity of Amending Ordinance. - The basic rule to determine the validity of an amending ordinance is the same rule used to determine the validity of the original ordinance. The legislative body must act in good faith. It cannot act arbitrarily
                            or capriciously. If the conditions existing at the time of the proposed change are such as would have originally justified the proposed action, the legislative body has the power to act. Allred v. City of Raleigh,

                            Inquiry Is Whether Amendment Is Beyond Legislative Power of City. - The relevant inquiry is always whether the amending ordinance is beyond the legislative power of the city. If it is not, the area rezoned becomes a legitimate part of the original comprehensive
                            zoning plan of the city. Allred v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 173 S.E.2d 533 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>, 178 S.E.2d

                            Effect of Unlawful Amending Ordinance. - If the amending ordinance is beyond the legislative power of the city, whether for the reason that it constitutes spot zoning or on some other ground, its adoption does not remove the designated area from the effect
                            of the comprehensive zoning ordinance previously enacted. In that event, the proposed use remains unlawful, and the right of owners of adjoining property to enjoin such use is not affected by the amending ordinance. Zopfi v.

                            Invalid Permit Does Not Qualify for Statutory Rights. - Superior court did not err in affirming the decision of a city zoning board of adjustment requiring a lessee to remove its billboard because the lessee's sign permit had expired before the lessee
                            renewed its building permit, and the lessee could not rely upon a mistakenly issued permit to establish vested rights in its nonconforming use of the property; an invalid permit does not qualify for statutory rights according
                            to the express language of G.S. 160A-385(b)(i). Morris Communs. Corp. v. City of Bessemer City Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 631, 689 S.E.2d 880 (2010), review

                            Permit May Not Be Denied Under Invalid Amendment. - An applicant's right to a permit, denied under an existing valid ordinance which entitled him to it, may not be defeated by a purported amendment which was void ab initio because it was not adopted as

                        Plan Consistency. - When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map amendment, the governing board shall approve a brief statement describing whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive plan. The requirement for a
                        plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear indication in the minutes of the governing board that at the time of action on the amendment the governing board was aware of and considered the planning board's recommendations
                        and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive plan. If a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending any future
                        land-use map in the approved plan, and no additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required. A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered concurrently. The plan consistency statement is not subject
                        to judicial review. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a "large-scale rezoning" under G.S. 160D-602(b), the governing board statement describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis
                        and policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the action taken.

                        may consider, among other factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned, (ii) the benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding community, (iii)

                    Zoning regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and shall be designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. To that end, the regulations may address, among other things, the following public purposes: to provide
                    adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and dangers; to facilitate the efficient and adequate
                    provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements; and to promote the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community. The regulations shall be made with reasonable consideration,
                    among other things, as to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the local government's
                    planning and development regulation jurisdiction. The regulations may not include, as a basis for denying a zoning or rezoning request from a school, the level of service of a road facility or facilities abutting the school or proximately
                    located to the school.

                            Standing to Challenge Rezoning. - City lacked standing to challenge a county's rezoning because the city sought to prevent use of land as sprayfields, but subject property and sprayfields were separate tracts located several miles apart and the sprayfields
                            were not rezoned; the disposal of treated wastewater would still have been allowed on the sprayfields despite a reversal of the second rezoning. Alleged injury was "conjectural or hypothetical" and insufficient to establish
                            standing. Morgan v. Nash County, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. App.</cite> 481, 731 S.E.2d 228 (2012).

                            City lacked standing to challenge a county's rezoning of certain property because 1) the land use the city sought to prevent was not made possible by the zoning amendment at issue; 2) the alleged injury was conjectural or hypothetical; and 3) the city's
                            property was three and a half miles from the rezoned property and thus was too remote to support a claim of standing. Morgan v. Nash County, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 60, 735 S.E.2d

                            County Zoning Ordinance Enacted Arbitrarily and Capriciously. - County zoning ordinance was enacted arbitrarily and capriciously under G.S. 153A-340(a) and G.S. 153A-341; no mention of the county's comprehensive plan was made in the minutes of the meeting
                            at which the county adopted the ordinance, and some of the permitted uses in the area were not consistent with a rural community character. Town of Green Level v. Alamance County, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite>                            665, 646 S.E.2d 851, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 704</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 402 (2007).

                            A county's legislative body has authority to rezone when reasonably necessary to do so in the interests of the public health, safety, morals or general welfare; ordinarily the only limitation upon this authority is that it may not be exercised arbitrarily
                            or capriciously. Willis v. Union County, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 335 S.E.2d 76 (1985); Nelson v. City of Burlington, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 285, 341 S.E.2d

                            Use of City-Owned Sewage Treatment Plant Without Prior Approval of County. - Since county had no authority to restrict or regulate city's provision of sewer service to its residents, the city could use city-owned sewage treatment plant located outside
                            the city but within the county, which was upgraded pursuant to the county's special use permit, with a condition attached to the permit requiring the county's prior approval of service to county citizens, to meet its statutory
                            mandate to provide sewer service to residents in newly annexed areas without seeking the county's prior approval, even though the facility was located in the county. Davidson County v. City of High Point,

                            Spot Zoning. - Because it zones a small area differently than a much larger area surrounding it, spot zoning, by definition, conflicts with the whole purpose of planned zoning. Therefore, unless there is a clear showing of a reasonable basis, spot zoning
                            is beyond the authority of the county or municipality. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 211, 354 S.E.2d 309 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>,

                            When adopting a rezoning amendment, a board of county commissioners (board) did not engage in improper spot zoning because: (1) the board did not change the property's zoning classification or reclassify any other tract in the zoning district but merely
                            approved relocating an existing chemical vat to another location, and (2) any spot zoning challenge to the property's classification was not timely. McDowell v. Randolph Cty., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite>                            708, 808 S.E.2d 513 (2017).

                            In determining whether rezoning was invalid as spot zoning, the courts have also considered the classification and development of nearby land. Alderman v. Chatham County, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 366 S.E.2d

                            Contract Zoning. - To avoid contract zoning, all the areas in each class must be subject to the same restrictions; if the rezoning is done in consideration of an assurance that a particular tract or parcel will be developed in accordance with a restricted
                            plan, this is contract zoning and is illegal. Willis v. Union County, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 335 S.E.2d 76 (1985).

                            That a board of county commissioners approved a rezoning application with the knowledge of a poultry processing company's interest in the subject property was not sufficient to establish that the board engaged in illegal contract zoning, as there was
                            no evidence that the board obligated itself to, or entered into a reciprocal agreement with, the landowners or processing company in exchange for approval of the rezoning application. Morgan v. Nash County,

                            All Permissible Uses Considered. - Board of county commissioners considered all of the permissible uses of the subject property before approving a zoning amendment, as the evidence established that: 1) each board member was provided with a list of all
                            permitted uses for the district; 2) the county planning director read aloud all permitted uses before the amendment was adopted; 3) the staff report to the board also included a complete list of the permitted uses; and 4) each
                            board member signed an affidavit averring that he or she considered all uses allowed in the zoning district being considered before casting his or her vote. Morgan v. Nash County, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite>                            60, 735 S.E.2d 615 (2012).

                            The concept of zoning implies a restriction upon the owner's right to use a specific tract for a use profitable to him but detrimental to the value of other properties in the area, thus promoting the most appropriate use of land throughout the municipality,
                            considered as a whole. Blades v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 531</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 35 (1972); Graham Court Assocs. v. Town Council, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite>                            543, 281 S.E.2d 418 (1981).

                            City Legislative Body May Not Disregard Fundamental Concepts of Zoning. - Notwithstanding that the motivation of the members of a city legislative body may be laudable, any action of that body that disregards the fundamental concepts of zoning as set
                            forth in the enabling legislation may be arbitrary and capricious. Allred v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 432 (1971).

                            Zoning ordinance deals basically with use, not ownership, of property. Graham Court Assocs. v. Town Council, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 281 S.E.2d 418 (1981).

                        <p>
                            Zoning is the regulation by a municipality of the use of land within that municipality, and of the buildings and structures thereon, and is not regulation of the ownership of the land or structures. Graham Court Assocs. v. Town Council,

                            Compliance with G.S. 160A-383 requires more than a general declaration that the action comports with relevant law. G.S. 160A-383 explains that to meet the statutory requirements, an approved statement must describe whether the zoning amendment is consistent
                            with any controlling land use plan and explain why it is reasonable and in the public interest. Wally v. City of Kannapolis, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 449</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 481 (2012).

                            the statutory language and could not reasonably be said to include an "explanation" as to why a proposed zoning amendment was reasonable and in the public interest under the plain meaning of that term. Atkinson v. City of Charlotte,

                            When adopting a rezoning amendment, a board of county commissioners (board) did not fail to adopt a valid statement of consistency with a growth management plan because the board, based on information from a public hearing, found the rezoning consistent
                            with the plan and reasonable and in the public interest. McDowell v. Randolph Cty., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 808 S.E.2d 513 (2017).

                            A "comprehensive plan" is simply a plan which zones an entire town or city, as opposed to a limited portion thereof arbitrarily selected for zoning, in a manner which is calculated to achieve the purposes set forth by statute. Allred v. City of Raleigh,

                            Validity of Zoning Amendment. - City's zoning amendment was invalid because the city council had not approved a statement of reasonableness as required by G.S. 160A-383 when adopting the amendment. Wally v. City of Kannapolis,

                            where the zoning ordinances were adopted in accordance with a small area plan, with goals that included: creating a greater mixture of land uses; planning for future mass transit service; developing pedestrian improvements;

                            Delegation of Power to Adopt Zoning Ordinances as Exception to Rule of Nondelegation of Legislative Powers. - The authority of the General Assembly to delegate to municipal corporations power to legislate concerning local problems, such as zoning, is
                            an exception, established by custom in most, if not all, of the states, to the general rule that legislative powers vested in the General Assembly may not be delegated by it. This exception to the doctrine of nondelegation
                            is not limited to a delegation of such legislative authority to incorporated cities and towns, but extends, as to other types of local matters, to a like delegation to counties and other units established by the General Assembly

                            It is the duty of municipal authorities, in their sound discretion, to determine what ordinances or regulations are reasonably necessary for the protection of the public or the better government of the town. When such ordinance is adopted, it is presumed
                            to be valid, and the courts will not declare it invalid unless it is clearly shown to be so. No law or ordinance will be declared unconstitutional unless it clearly is, and every reasonable intendment will be made to sustain

                            When Enactment or Amendment of Ordinance Is Invalid. - The legislative act of enacting or amending a zoning ordinance is invalid if it is unreasonable, arbitrary, or an unequal exercise of legislative power. Chrismon v. Guilford County,

                            County zoning ordinance was enacted arbitrarily and capriciously under G.S. 153A-340(a) and G.S. 153A-341; no mention of the county's comprehensive plan was made in the minutes of the meeting at which the county adopted the ordinance, and some of the
                            permitted uses in the area were not consistent with a rural community character. Town of Green Level v. Alamance County, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 665, 646 S.E.2d 851, review denied,

                            Burden of Showing Invalidity Is on Person Asserting It. - The burden to show that a zoning ordinance as a whole is not a proper exercise of the police power rests upon the property owner who asserts its invalidity. County of Durham v. Addison,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">262 N.C. 280</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 600 (1964).

                            Mere fact that a zoning ordinance seriously depreciates the value of complainant's property is not enough, standing alone, to establish its invalidity. County of Durham v. Addison, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 280</cite>,

                            The practice of conditional use zoning is an approved practice in North Carolina, so long as the action of the local zoning authority in accomplishing the zoning is reasonable, neither arbitrary nor unduly discriminatory, and in the public interest. Chrismon

                            Rezoning Held Valid Conditional Use Zoning. - The rezoning of two tracts of land from A-1 to CU-M-2 so as to allow the storage and sale of agricultural chemicals was valid conditional use zoning and not illegal contract zoning. Chrismon v. Guilford County,
                            <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                            Additional Reasonable Conditions. - Trial court ruling was upheld when it simply ruled that a Zoning Board of Adjustment could not impose conditions on a conditional use permit that were in derogation of either the express conditions of a county Uniform
                            Development Ordinance, or the reasonable conditions permitted in addition to those expressly provided pursuant to G.S. 153A-340(c); the trial court did not rule that the board could not impose conditions upon a property owner's
                            conditional use permit. Overton v. Camden County, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 100, 574 S.E.2d 150 (2002).

                            While the county board of adjustment could not attach conditions to the replacement mobile home if it continued as a nonconforming use, when issuing a conditional use permit, the board could attach reasonable conditions under G.S. 153A-340(c). The conditions
                            imposed by the board, including that the replacement mobile home was to satisfy inspection and that one individual inhabit the replacement mobile home at all times, were not unreasonable or inappropriate. Overton v. Camden

                            A county's zoning authority is limited: it can be applied only to buildings within the county's borders which are outside city limits, and it is confined to the purposes of promoting health, safety, morals, or the general welfare. Davidson County v. City

                            Use of City-Owned Sewage Treatment Plant Without Prior Approval of County. - Since county had no authority to restrict or regulate city's provision of sewer service to its residents, the city could use city-owned sewage treatment plant located outside
                            the city but within the county, which was upgraded pursuant to the county's special use permit, with a condition attached to the permit requiring the county's prior approval of service to county citizens, to meet its statutory
                            mandate to provide sewer service to residents in newly annexed areas without seeking the county's prior approval, even though the facility was located in the county. Davidson County v. City of High Point,

                            Clear Showing of Reasonable Basis for Spot Zoning. - While the rezoning of two tracts from A-1 to CU-M-2, so as to allow the storage and sale of agricultural chemicals, constituted a form of spot zoning, this activity was legal and not illegal spot zoning.
                            Because of the substantial benefits created for the surrounding community by the rezoning and because of the close relationship between the likely uses of the rezoned property and the uses already present in the surrounding
                            tracts, there was a clear showing of a reasonable basis for the spot zoning. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                            The principal differences between valid conditional use zoning and illegal contract zoning are related and are essentially two in number: First, valid conditional use zoning features merely a unilateral promise from the landowner to the local zoning authority
                            as to the landowner's intended use of the land in question, while illegal contract zoning anticipates a bilateral contract in which the landowner and the zoning authority make reciprocal promises. Second, in the context of
                            conditional use zoning, the local zoning authority maintains its independent decision-making authority, while in the contract zoning scenario, it abandons that authority by binding itself contractually with the landowner seeking
                            a zoning amendment. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                            Power of County Commissioners to Grant Special Exceptions. - Statute authorizing the board of county commissioners by regulation to provide that the board of adjustment or the board of county commissioners may issue special use permits or conditional
                            permits in the classes of cases or situations and in accordance with the principles, conditions, safeguards, and procedures specified in the zoning ordinance did not purport to confer more power upon the commissioners to grant
                            special exceptions than the commissioners could delegate to the board of adjustment. In re Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 419</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 77 (1970).

                        <p>
                            Like the board of adjustment, the commissioners cannot deny applicants a permit in their unguided discretion or, stated differently, refuse it solely because, in their view, a mobile-home park would adversely affect the public interest. The commissioners
                            must also proceed under standards, rules and regulations uniformly applicable to all who apply for permits. In re Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 419</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 77 (1970).

                            Trial court reviewing a board of adjustment's denial of a developer's request for a special use permit did not meet the court's duty to ensure that the board followed quasi-judicial procedures ensuring the developer a fair trial because, (1) at a hearing
                            held before the board, when an appellate court remanded the matter for the board to make reviewable findings, the board let opponents of the request present new evidence without granting the developer a similar opportunity,
                            and (2) the court did not address these violations of procedure and the developer's due process rights. Templeton Props., L.P. v. Town of Boone, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 266, 724

                            a zoning ordinance, and the county was not permitted to evade the legislative notice requirements imposed by G.S. 153A-323 by labeling the Ordinance an exercise of police power. Thrash Ltd. P'ship v. County of Buncombe,

                            Applying the principle of noscitur a sociis to G.S. 153A-340(b)(2a), shooting activities that require the construction and use of artificial structures and the alteration of natural land, such as clearing farm property to operate gun ranges, share little
                            resemblance to the listed rural agritourism activity examples or the same spirit of preservation or traditionalism. Applying that same principle to subdivision (2a)'s examples of agritourism events yields the same interpretation.

                            used have been generally upheld by the courts as an exercise of the police power of the State. Vance S. Harrington &amp; Co. v. Renner, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 321</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 838 (1952);

                            Zoning Authority Delegated by the General Assembly. - The General Assembly has delegated to the legislative body of cities and incorporated towns the power to adopt zoning regulations and, from time to time, to amend or repeal such regulations. In re

                            The General Assembly has delegated to the legislative body of a municipality the power to adopt zoning regulations for the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals or the general welfare of the community. Allgood v. Town of Tarboro,

                            A municipal corporation has no inherent power to zone its territory and restrict to specified purposes the use of private property in each such zone. Such power has, however, been delegated to the cities and incorporated towns of this State by the General
                            Assembly. Zopfi v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 430</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 325 (1968); Decker v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 169 S.E.2d 487 (1969).

                            A municipality has no inherent power to zone its territory and possesses only such power to zone as is delegated to it by the enabling statutes. Heaton v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 506</cite>, 178 S.E.2d

                            Delegation of Zoning Power as Exception to General Rule. - The authority of the General Assembly to delegate to municipal corporations power to legislate concerning local problems, such as zoning, is an exception to the general rule that legislative powers,
                            vested in the General Assembly by N.C. Const., Art. II,
                            <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 1, may not be delegated by it. This exception to the doctrine of nondelegation is not limited to a delegation of such legislative authority to incorporated cities and towns, but extends, as to other types of local
                            matters, to a like delegation to counties and other units established by the General Assembly for local government. Jackson v. Guilford County Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 155</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 78 (1969).

                            Delegation of Zoning Power Cannot Exceed Power of General Assembly. - The General Assembly cannot delegate to a municipal corporation more extensive power to regulate the use of private property than the General Assembly itself possesses. Zopfi v. City
                            of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 430</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 325 (1968).

                        <p>
                            Zoning Power Cannot Be Further Delegated to Board of Adjustment. - The privilege of erecting a nonconforming building or a building for a nonconforming use may not be granted by the board of adjustment under the guise of a variance permit, as the board
                            of adjustment has no power to amend the ordinance under which it functions. Lee v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 107</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 128 (1946).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The power to zone is conferred upon the governing body of the municipality and cannot be delegated to the board of adjustment. Hence, a board of adjustment has no power to permit a type of business or building prohibited by an ordinance, for to do so
                            would be an amendment of the law and not a variance of its regulations. James v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 515</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 300 (1948); In re O'Neal, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 714</cite>,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The legislative body of the municipal corporation may not delegate to the municipal board of adjustment the power to zone; that is, the power originally vested in the General Assembly to legislate with reference to the use which may be made of land and
                            the structures which may be erected or located thereon. It follows that a county zoning ordinance may not delegate such legislative powers to the county board of adjustment. Jackson v. Guilford County Bd. of Adjustment,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">275 N.C. 155</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 78 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The legislative body of the municipal corporation may not delegate to the municipal board of adjustment the power to zone. Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 17</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 616
                            (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It would constitute an unlawful delegation and exercise of the legislative power vested by the General Assembly in the board of aldermen of Winston-Salem to allow the board of adjustment to deny a special permit on the ground that the board of adjustment
                            did not consider a use specified in the ordinance as a conditional permissible use to be in accord with the "purpose and intent" of the ordinance. Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment,
                            <cite

                            Power to Zone Need Not Be Exercised. - The grant of the power to zone to a municipal corporation imposes no duty upon the city or town to exercise it, and the courts may not require the city or town to enact zoning legislation. This is a matter within
                            the discretion of the legislative body of the city or town. Zopfi v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 430</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 325 (1968).

                            Zoning Authority Is Not Exhausted by Adoption of a Zoning Ordinance. - The adoption of a zoning ordinance in exercise of the police power, delegated to a municipal corporation, does not exhaust that power. Zopfi v. City of Wilmington,

                        <p>
                            In enacting and enforcing zoning regulations, a municipality acts as a governmental agency and exercises the police power of the State. Armstrong v. McInnis, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 616</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 670 (1965);
                            Taylor v. Bowen, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 726</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 837 (1968).

                        <p>
                            Zoning laws, when valid, are an exercise of the police power of the sovereign to reasonably regulate or restrict the use of private property to promote the public health, the public safety, the public morals or the public welfare. Zopfi v. City of Wilmington,
                            <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 430</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 325 (1968).

                            Power to Zone Is Subject to Limitations of Enabling Act. - The power to zone, conferred upon the legislative body of a municipality, is subject to the limitations of the enabling act. Schloss v. Jamison, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 108</cite>,
                            136 S.E.2d 691 (1964); Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 17</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 616 (1971).

                        <p>
                            The power to zone, conferred upon the legislative body of a municipality, is subject to the limitations of the enabling act. Within the limits of the powers so delegated, the municipality exercises the police power of the State. Allred v. City of Raleigh,

                            A zoning ordinance or an amendment thereto which is not adopted in accordance with the enabling statutes is invalid and ineffective. Heaton v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 506</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 352 (1971);

                            Limitations Imposed by the Constitution. - The authority of a city or town to enact zoning ordinances is subject both to the limitations imposed by the Constitution and to the limitations of the enabling statute. Zopfi v. City of Wilmington,

                            Exercise by a city of delegated power to zone is subject both to limitations imposed by the Constitution upon the legislative power of the State itself, forbidding arbitrary and unduly discriminatory interference with the rights of property owners, and
                            also to the limitations in the statutes by which the power was delegated. Decker v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 169 S.E.2d 487 (1969).

                            The authority to zone property and to restrict to specified purposes the uses of private property within each zone is limited by the provisions of the enabling statute and also by constitutional provisions which forbid arbitrary and unduly discriminatory
                            interference with the rights of property owners. Allred v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 173 S.E.2d 533 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>,

                            The authority to enact zoning ordinances is subject to the limitations imposed by the enabling statute and by the Constitution. These limitations forbid arbitrary and unduly discriminatory interference with property rights in the exercise of such power.

                            Unlawful Contract Zoning. - Illegal contract zoning connotes a transaction wherein both the landowner who is seeking a certain zoning action and the zoning authority itself undertake reciprocal obligations in the context of a bilateral contract. This
                            depends upon a finding of a transaction in which both the landowner seeking a rezoning and the zoning authority undertake reciprocal obligations; in short, a "meeting of the minds" must occur; mutual assurances must be exchanged.

                            Who May Challenge Rezoning Ordinance. - In order to challenge a rezoning ordinance, one must have a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter affected by the ordinance and must be directly and adversely affected by the ordinance. Davis
                            v. City of Archdale, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 344 S.E.2d 369 (1986).

                            Alleged diminution in the value of the property of adjacent or nearby landowners due to increased traffic on roads which already carried traffic volumes in excess of capacity and due to increased demands upon already overburdened public utilities are
                            not special damages distinct from those of the rest of the community, and plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge rezoning ordinances on such grounds. Davis v.

                            Criteria for Validity of Zoning Ordinance. - An ordinance passed under an enabling statute, following its provisions and carrying it into effect in the city passing it, prescribing uniform regulations for each zone or district and giving an inspector
                            certain judicial functions with respect to the kind or class of buildings under a board of adjustment and review, and providing for certiorari, is a valid exercise of power and not repugnant to the organic law prohibiting discriminations.
                            Harden v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 395</cite>, 135 S.E. 151 (1926).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A zoning ordinance covering all land within the municipality and separating commercial and industrial districts of the city from those set apart for residences, schools, parks, libraries, churches, etc., which is uniform and operates alike on all territory
                            within the respective zones, bears a reasonable relation to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the entire community, and is a valid and constitutional exercise of the delegated police power of the municipality.
                            Kinney v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 404</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 306 (1949).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a general rule a zoning ordinance of a municipality is valid and enforceable if it emanates from ample grant of power by the legislature to the city or town, if it has a reasonable tendency to promote the public safety, health, morals, comfort, welfare
                            and prosperity and if its provisions are not arbitrary, unreasonable or confiscatory. Helms v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 647</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 817 (1961).

                        <p>
                            Substantial Relation to Public Welfare Essential. - Zoning ordinances are upheld when, but only when, they bear a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Schloss v. Jamison, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 108</cite>,
                            136 S.E.2d 691 (1964).

                        <p>
                            Depreciation of Property Not Enough to Invalidate Ordinance. - The mere fact that a zoning ordinance seriously depreciates the value of complainant's property is not enough, standing alone, to establish its invalidity. Helms v. City of Charlotte,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">255 N.C. 647</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 817 (1961); County of Durham v. Addison, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 280</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 600 (1964).

                        <p>
                            If the police power is properly exercised in the zoning of a municipality, a resultant pecuniary loss to a property owner is a misfortune which he must suffer as a member of society. Schloss v. Jamison, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 108</cite>,
                            136 S.E.2d 691 (1964).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unless Property Is Rendered Valueless by Impossibility of Permitted Use. - A municipal zoning ordinance is confiscatory and invalid in its application to a particular lot if it is practically impossible to use such lot for the purpose permitted by the
                            ordinance so that the ordinance renders such property valueless for practical purposes. Helms v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 647</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 817 (1961).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fact that a lot would be more valuable if devoted to a nonconforming use does not deprive owner of property without due process of law when the zoning regulations are uniform in their application to all within the respective districts, and the differentiation
                            of the uses of property within the respective districts is in accordance with a comprehensive plan in the interest of the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the entire community. Kinney v. Sutton,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">230 N.C. 404</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 306 (1949).

                        <p>
                            Two of the essentials of a comprehensive zoning ordinance are: (1) It applies to all territory subject to the zoning jurisdiction of a city council, including the area beyond and surrounding the corporate limits of the city for a distance of one mile
                            in all directions, and (2) with reference to property within a particular district or zone, all uses permissible in the zone are available as of right to the owner. Allred v. City of Raleigh,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 432 (1971).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The test of whether the means of the regulation of land use are reasonable is two pronged: 1) whether the ordinance as applied is reasonably necessary to promote the public good and, 2) whether the interference with the owner's right to use the property
                            is reasonable in degree. Messer v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 479 S.E.2d 221 (1996).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            As to validity of comprehensive zoning ordinances, see Allred v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 432 (1971). See also, Schloss v. Jamison, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 108</cite>, 136

                            Mere laxity of enforcement will not invalidate zoning restrictions. Sherrill v. Town of Wrightsville Beach, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 344 S.E.2d 357, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 417</cite>,

                        <p>
                            As to the showing necessary to invalidate zoning ordinance on constitutional grounds, see Sherrill v. Town of Wrightsville Beach, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 344 S.E.2d 357, cert. denied and appeal dismissed,
                            <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 417</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 600 (1986).

                            Zoning and Property Lines Need Not Coincide. - It is not a prerequisite to the validity of a zoning ordinance that the zoning district lines should coincide with property lines. Helms v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 647</cite>,
                            122 S.E.2d 817 (1961).

                            City May Limit Use of Property in Residential District. - Former G.S. 160-172 authorized municipalities to enact zoning ordinances prohibiting the use of property within a residential district for business or commercial purposes. Kinney v. Sutton,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">230 N.C. 404</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 306 (1949).

                            Conversion of Apartments to Condominiums Not a Change in Use Subject to Zoning Regulation. - Contemplated change in ownership to condominiums does not constitute a change in use which a town may regulate by its zoning ordinance. Graham Court Assocs. v.
                            Town Council, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 281 S.E.2d 418 (1981).

                        <p>
                            Where petitioner's apartment complex property did not comply with zoning ordinance requirements for multi-family housing, but its continued use as multi-family housing was permitted as a prior nonconforming use under the zoning ordinance of respondent
                            town, contemplated change in ownership to condominiums did not constitute a change in use which respondent town could regulate by a zoning ordinance, and respondent lacked the right or legal authority to require petitioner
                            to apply for or receive a special use permit as a prerequisite to its right to sell the apartments as condominiums. Graham Court Assocs. v. Town Council, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite>                            543, 281 S.E.2d 418 (1981).

                        <p>
                            In enacting a zoning ordinance a municipality is engaged in legislating, not in contracting. Allred v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 432 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In enacting a zoning ordinance, a municipality is engaged in legislating and not in contracting. As a consequence, a zoning ordinance fixing the boundaries of zones does not result in a contract between the municipality and property owners precluding
                            the municipality from afterwards changing the boundaries if it deems a change to be desirable. Moreover, a zoning ordinance does not vest in a property owner the right that the restrictions imposed by it upon his property or
                            the property of others shall remain unaltered. Marren v. Gamble, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 680</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 880 (1953).

                        <p>
                            Zoning regulations may be amended or changed when such action is authorized by the enabling statute and does not contravene constitutional limitations on the zoning power. Marren v. Gamble, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 680</cite>,
                            75 S.E.2d 880 (1953).

                            Entire Ordinance to Be Considered on Review. - In examining the reasonableness of a zoning ordinance, due process dictates that the court look at the entire ordinance and not only at the provision as it applies to a particular inhabitant of the municipality.

                            declare a statute to be so meaningless and unintelligible as to be inoperative. Heaton v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 506</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 352 (1971).

                            that can be said against an ordinance adopted in the proper exercise of the police power is that whether it was an unreasonable, arbitrary or unequal exercise of power is fairly debatable, the courts will not interfere. Schloss

                            Ordinance Permitting Commercial Activities by Family Members in Residential District. - Provisions of a zoning ordinance which permit commercial and industrial activities within a residential district, provided such activities are carried on by members
                            of the immediate family and not more than two persons are employed therein, does not render the ordinance void as being discriminatory, since the commercial activities permitted thereunder in a residential district are so intrinsically

                            Zoning ordinance which prohibited operation of a building material salvage yard in certain districts, and which permitted a three-year period after it was adopted for the removal of such business, was not so arbitrary, unreasonable or unrelated to the
                            general welfare of the community as to be unconstitutional by its terms; to the contrary, it represented a conscious effort on the part of the legislative body of the city to regulate the use of land throughout the city and

                            the municipality, at least for purpose of sustaining a finding to that effect upon the hearing of an order to show cause why a temporary order restraining the violation of the ordinance should not be continued to the hearing.

                            Zoning Based on Race Invalid. - A zoning ordinance limiting the uses of property solely on the basis of race is beyond the scope of police power, since the reserved police power of the State must stop when it encroaches on the protection afforded the

                            a parking lot was not a building or the use of a building as that term was provided for in the 2003 version of G.S. 160A-392 applicable to the matter; therefore, the Board of Adjustment had no zoning power and no special use

                            Safeguards against arbitrary action by zoning boards in granting or denying special use permits are not only to be found in specific guidelines for their action. Equally important are requirements that in each instance the board (1) follow the procedures
                            specified in the ordinance; (2) conduct its hearings in accordance with fair-trial standards; (3) base its findings of fact only upon competent, material, and substantial evidence; and (4) in allowing or denying the application,
                            state the basic facts on which it relied with sufficient specificity to inform the parties, as well as the court, what induced its decision. Humble Oil &amp; Ref. Co. v. Board of Aldermen,

                            In passing upon an application for a special permit, a town council may not violate at will the regulations it has established for its own procedure; it must comply with the provisions of the applicable ordinance. This requirement is necessary in order
                            to accord due process and equal protection to applicants and to refute charges that any denial is an arbitrary discrimination against the property owner. Piney Mt. Neighborhood Ass'n v. Town of Chapel Hill,

                            When a town council conducts a quasi-judicial hearing to determine facts prerequisite to issuance of a permit, it can dispense with no essential element of a fair trial. The applicant must have the opportunity to give evidence, cross-examine witnesses,
                            and inspect documents; and unsworn statements may not be used to support findings absent waiver or stipulation. In allowing or denying the application, the council must state the basic facts on which it relied with sufficient
                            specificity to inform the parties, as well as the court, what induced its decision. Piney Mt. Neighborhood Ass'n v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 244, 304 S.E.2d

                            Erroneous Denial of Conditional Use Permit. - County commissioners erred in denying a conditional use permit (CUP) to build a solar farm because (1) applicants showed prima facie entitlement to a CUP, as a solar farm was a public utility facility permitted
                            in the zone at issue, and they produced a site plan and competent testimony complying with all CUP requirements and competent, material, and substantial evidence showing compliance with more general zoning requirements, and
                            (2) CUP opponents did not meet their burden with speculative and general lay opinions and bare or vague assertions on a matter requiring scientific, technical or other specialized or personal knowledge outside the experience
                            of an ordinary person. Innovative 55, LLC v. Robeson Cty., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 714, 801 S.E.2d 671 (2017).

                            It was error to deny a special use permit because (1) a county made a legislative decision to permit the use with a special use permit, (2) the applicant made a prima facie showing of entitlement to the permit, and (3) rebuttal evidence of generalized
                            fears and speculation of lay witnesses did not rebut that prima facie showing and the legislative decision. Little River, LLC v. Lee Cty., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 809 S.E.2d

                            Trial court erred in affirming the decision of the county board of adjustment to uphold the denial of a limited liability company's application for a High Impact Land Use (HILU) permit on the ground that its proposed asphalt plant site was located within
                            1,500 feet of an education center because the center did not qualify as an "educational facility" under the county's HILU ordinance. Appalachian Materials, LLC v.

                            Standing to Challenge Conditional Use Permit. - Upon de novo review, the appellate court found that the superior court erred when it dismissed the town residents, the country club residents, the architects, and the development team members' appeal under
                            G.S. 160A-381(c) and G.S. 160A-388 pursuant to a writ of certiorari for lack of standing because the proposed development would have been unlawful without an amendment to the town's zoning ordinances and the issuance of a conditional
                            use permit. Furthermore, in conjunction with the allegations of proximity contained in the petition, the testimony was sufficient to establish the town residents, the country club residents, the architects, and the development
                            team members' standing with special damages resulting from water runoff, septic tank pollution, increased noise, increased traffic on narrow roadways, and the danger to the town residents and neighborhood children on the roadways.

                        <p>
                            Dismissal based on sovereign immunity was proper because conditional use permitting requires the exercise of substantial discretion on the part of local officials in deciding important community-wide land use policies, and therefore, is legislative and
                            discretionary in nature. Stephenson v. Town of Garner, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 444, 524 S.E.2d 608 (2000).

                            Practice of conditional use zoning is an approved practice in North Carolina, so long as the action of the local zoning authority in accomplishing the zoning is reasonable, neither arbitrary nor unduly discriminatory, and in the public interest. Chrismon
                            v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Cities are not obliged to use a two-step legislative/ quasi-judicial proceeding in ruling on requests for re-zoning; conditional use zoning is proper as long as the zoning is reasonable, neither arbitrary nor unduly discriminatory, and in the public interest.

                            Principal differences between valid conditional use zoning and illegal contract zoning are related and are essentially two in number: First, valid conditional use zoning features merely a unilateral promise from the landowner to the local zoning authority
                            as to the landowner's intended use of the land in question, while illegal contract zoning anticipates a bilateral contract in which the landowner and the zoning authority make reciprocal promises. Second, in the context of
                            conditional use zoning, the local zoning authority maintains its independent decision-making authority, while in the contract zoning scenario, it abandons that authority by binding itself contractually with the landowner seeking
                            a zoning amendment. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                            It is not necessary that property rezoned to a conditional use district be available for all of the uses allowed under the corresponding general use district. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>,

                            Concerns about the adverse effect of a proposed development upon traffic congestion and safety are valid. Such concerns support the denial of a special use permit. Ghidorzi Constr., Inc. v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 438</cite>,

                            Conditions Attached to a Conditional Use Permit Should be Based on Factual Findings. - Under a town's land use ordinance, a municipal board had the authority to adopt certain conditions when it granted an application for a conditional use permit, however,
                            the board committed an error of law in adopting two challenged conditions because it failed to make factual findings in support of its decision to impose the challenged conditions. Northwest Prop. Group, LLC v. Town of Carrboro,

                            Where petitioners produced competent, material and substantial prima facie evidence to show their compliance with four general conditions required to obtain a special use permit needed to construct a mobile home park, and where the city council failed
                            to make adequate findings of fact to support denial of the special use application, such action constituted "an unlawful exercise of legislative power by the Board . . . in violation of Article II, Section I, of the Constitution
                            of North Carolina." Clark v. City of Asheboro, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 524 S.E.2d 46 (1999).

                            to issue a special use permit was not an unlawful exercise of legislative power. Kenan v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 688, 187 S.E.2d 496, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 314</cite>,

                            Spot zoning is not invalid per se, but rather, it is beyond the authority of the municipality or county and therefore void only in the absence of a clear showing of a reasonable basis therefor. Chrismon v. Guilford County,

                            Form of Spot Zoning Held Legal. - While the rezoning of two tracts from A-1 to CU-M-2, so as to allow the storage and sale of agricultural chemicals, constituted a form of spot zoning, this activity was not illegal spot zoning. Because of the substantial
                            benefits created for the surrounding community by the rezoning and because of the close relationship between the likely uses of the rezoned property and the uses already present in the surrounding tracts, there was a clear
                            showing of a reasonable basis for the spot zoning. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                            both statute and ordinance are followed, (3) insuring that appropriate due process rights of a petitioner are protected including the right to offer evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and inspect documents, (4) insuring that
                            decisions of town boards are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence in the whole record, and (5) insuring that decisions are not arbitrary and capricious. Ghidorzi Constr., Inc. v. Town of Chapel Hill,

                            The question before the Court of Appeals is not whether the evidence before the superior court supported that court's order as to the special use application, but whether the evidence before the town council supported the council's action. The superior
                            court is not the trier of fact. That is the function of the town council. Ghidorzi Constr., Inc. v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 342 S.E.2d 545, cert. denied,

                            Where applicants for a conditional use permit did not show that a proposed crematorium would not be detrimental to or endanger the general welfare, they did not show that the proposed use would comply with all of a city's standards; in affirming the denial
                            of the application, the trial court applied the proper standard of review in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G.S. 160A-381(c), and its decision was supported by substantial evidence. Butler v. City Council of Clinton,

                            proper scope of review set for in case law; because the trial court failed to apply the proper scope of review, the case was revered and remanded. McMillan v. Town of Tryon, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite>                            228, 683 S.E.2d 747 (2009).

                            Based on the language of G.S. 160A-381, a trial court properly applied the whole record test in finding that a board of adjustment's denial of a county's application for zoning approval was not supported by substantial evidence, as the denial of approval
                            for alternative parking for a courthouse, and the refusal to grant a zoning compliance permit, was arbitrary and capricious. Orange County v. Town of Hillsborough, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite>                            127, 724 S.E.2d 560 (2012).

                            for a new permit and applied the standard under a new ordinance; instead of voiding the original permit, which was issued in 1997, the board should have considered the application in light of the standards in effect prior to
                            October of 2000, the date of the new ordinance, and had the board done so, it should have found that the mine operator met the burden when the mine operator produced a current permit from the Department of Environment, Health,
                            and Natural Resources, Division of Land Resources for the activities contemplated and the 1997 ordinance had no other, more stringent conditions specified. Hewett v.

                            Vested Rights Under Building Permit. - Issuance of a building permit creates no vested right to build contrary to the provisions of a subsequently enacted zoning ordinance, unless the permittee, acting in good faith, has made substantial expenditures
                            in reliance upon the permit at a time when they did not violate declared public policy. Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 715</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 175 (1972).

                            When builder obtains a permit knowing of a pending ordinance which would make authorized construction a nonconforming use and hereafter hurriedly makes expenditures in an attempt to acquire a vested right before the law can be changed, he does not act
                            in good faith and acquires no rights under the permit. Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 715</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 175 (1972).

                            Permit Could Not Be Arbitrarily Denied. - The town board could not deny the petitioners a conditional use permit where the decision was based on opinions and generalized fears, even those of a realtor, rather than on facts or other substantial evidence
                            that the operation of an extended-stay hotel would "materially endanger the public health or safety" or that the project would "substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property"; although the project would increase
                            traffic, no evidence indicated that this would mean an intensification of traffic congestion or a traffic hazard, nor were the expert opinions expressing concern about property values supported by certified appraisals or market

                            Permit Could Not Be Denied Under Invalid Amendment. - An applicant's right to a permit, denied under an existing valid ordinance which entitled him to it, could not be defeated by a purported amendment which was void ab initio because it was not adopted
                            as required by the enabling statute. Keiger v. Winston-Salem Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 715</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 175 (1972).

                            An ordinance which classifies mobile homes differently from modular and site-built homes is valid. The protection of property values in the zoned area is a legitimate governmental objective, and the method of construction of homes may be determined by
                            a city governing board as affecting the price of homes. The prohibition of such buildings is rationally related to the protection of the value of other homes in the area. Duggins v. Town of Walnut Cove,

                            Aggrieved Party for Judicial Review. - An adjoining property owner was an aggrieved party, even though she failed to allege such, and the trial court had jurisdiction to allow her to amend her petition for certiorari, where she sought certiorari for judicial

                            assume the Legislature intended to leave determination of the timeliness of a petition for certiorari to the superior court in which the petition is filed. White Oak Properties, Inc. v. Town of Carrboro,

                            Timeliness Depends on Circumstances. - In the absence of a designated time period within which to seek review of a decision by a board of aldermen, the superior court must determine, in its discretion, whether a petition for writ of certiorari has been
                            filed within a reasonable time of the decision of the board of aldermen. What is a reasonable time must, in all cases, depend upon the circumstances. White Oak Properties, Inc. v. Town of Carrboro,

                            Timeliness Decided Under Equitable Doctrine of Laches. - Generally, whether a petition for certiorari has been timely filed can be decided by determining whether the petitioner's delay bars him under the equitable doctrine of laches from being afforded

                            G.S. 160A-388(e) adds that " [a]ny petition for review by the superior court shall be filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after the decision of the board [of adjustment] is filed in such office as the ordinance

                            however, it was proper for the motion for summary judgment to come before the trial court on the questions raised in plaintiff's complaint, which had been improperly joined with her petition for writ of certiorari. Batch v.

                        Conditional Districts. - Property may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by all owners of the property to be included. Specific conditions may be proposed by the petitioner or the local government or its agencies, but only
                        those conditions approved by the local government and consented to by the petitioner in writing may be incorporated into the zoning regulations. Unless consented to by the petitioner in writing, in the exercise of the authority
                        granted by this section, a local government may not require, enforce, or incorporate into the zoning regulations any condition or requirement not authorized by otherwise applicable law, including, without limitation, taxes, impact
                        fees, building design elements within the scope of G.S. 160D-702(b), driveway-related improvements in excess of those allowed in G.S. 136-18(29) and G.S. 160A-307, or other unauthorized limitations on the development or use of
                        land. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to local government ordinances, plans adopted pursuant
                        to G.S. 160D-501, or the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. The zoning regulation may provide that defined minor modifications in conditional district standards that do not involve
                        a change in uses permitted or the density of overall development permitted may be reviewed and approved administratively. Any other modification of the conditions and standards in a conditional district shall follow the same process
                        for approval as are applicable to zoning map amendments. If multiple parcels of land are subject to a conditional zoning, the owners of individual parcels may apply for modification of the conditions so long as the modification
                        would not result in other properties failing to meet the terms of the conditions. Any modifications approved apply only to those properties whose owners petition for the modification.

                            Zoning Map Requirement. - This section does not require the county to have a zoning map for the entire county when its objective is to implement zoning on an area by area basis; only a map of the area being zoned and a full text of the zoning ordinance
                            zoned are required. Frizzelle v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 416 S.E.2d 421, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 147</cite>, 419 S.E.2d 571 (1992).

                            The practice of conditional use zoning is an approved practice in North Carolina, so long as the action of the local zoning authority in accomplishing the zoning is reasonable, neither arbitrary nor unduly discriminatory, and in the public interest. Chrismon

                                class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                            Spot zoning is not invalid per se, but rather, it is beyond the authority of the municipality or county and therefore void only in the absence of a clear showing of a reasonable basis therefor. Chrismon v. Guilford County,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                            Clear Showing of Reasonable Basis for Spot Zoning. - While the rezoning of two tracts from A-1 to CU-M-2, so as to allow the storage and sale of agricultural chemicals, constituted a form of spot zoning, this activity was legal and not illegal spot zoning.
                            Because of the substantial benefits created for the surrounding community by the rezoning and because of the close relationship between the likely uses of the rezoned property and the uses already present in the surrounding
                            tracts, there was a clear showing of a reasonable basis for the spot zoning. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                        <p>
                            The principal differences between valid conditional use zoning and illegal contract zoning are related and are essentially two in number: First, valid conditional use zoning features merely a unilateral promise from the landowner to the local zoning authority
                            as to the landowner's intended use of the land in question, while illegal contract zoning anticipates a bilateral contract in which the landowner and the zoning authority make reciprocal promises. Second, in the context of
                            conditional use zoning, the local zoning authority maintains its independent decision-making authority, while in the contract zoning scenario, it abandons that authority by binding itself contractually with the landowner seeking
                            a zoning amendment. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                            Rezoning Held Valid Conditional Use Zoning. - The rezoning of two tracts of land from A-1 to CU-M-2 so as to allow the storage and sale of agricultural chemicals was valid conditional use zoning and not illegal contract zoning. Chrismon v. Guilford County,
                            <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                            Zoning Ordinance Invalid Where Improperly Enacted. - County's failure to comply with G.S. 153A-323 in enacting the Buncombe County, N.C. Multi-Family Dwelling Ordinance (Ordinance) rendered the ordinance invalid; although the county claimed that the Ordinance
                            was adopted in the exercise of its general police power pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html#t153Aa06s153A-121" target="_blank">G.S. 153A-121</a></cite>, the Ordinance
                            substantially affected land use, was therefore a zoning ordinance, and the county was not permitted to evade the legislative notice requirements imposed by G.S. 153A-323 by labeling the Ordinance an exercise of police power.
                            Thrash Ltd. P'ship v. County of Buncombe, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 727, 673 S.E.2d 689 (2009).

                        <p>
                            A county sign ordinance did not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV or N.C. Const., Art. I,
                            <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 19, because the county would not enforce the ordinance with respect to any person owning or operating a sign in certain municipalities within the county, since the county could not exercise zoning authority within
                            a city which had enacted a zoning ordinance, and it could defer from zoning within cities. County of Cumberland v. Eastern Fed. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 269 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 527</cite>,

                            Ordinance Held Valid. - Trial court did not err in granting a county summary judgment in a property owner's action alleging that an ordinance the county passed was beyond its zoning power because the ordinance was within the county's statutorily granted
                            zoning power and applied to all lots zoned agricultural, and the owner cited no authority tending to show that counties had to allow residences in all zoning districts; the ordinance, which prohibited all residential uses for
                            agricultural districts, prohibited only residences in a certain zone and left intact the other uses of the land approved by the county; therefore, the owner was not deprived of all uses of the land. Tonter Invs., Inc. v. Pasquotank

                            Two of the essentials of a comprehensive zoning ordinance are: (1) it applies to all territory subject to the zoning jurisdiction of a city council, including the area beyond and surrounding the corporate limits of the city for a distance of one mile
                            in all directions; and (2) with reference to property within a particular district or zone, all uses permissible in the zone are available as of right to the owner. Allred v. City of Raleigh,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 432 (1971).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The law does not require all areas of a defined class to be contiguous, but when a classification has been made, all areas in each class must be subject to the same restrictions. Decker v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite>                            102, 169 S.E.2d 487 (1969).

                        <p>
                            Different areas in a municipality may be put in the same class. Decker v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 169 S.E.2d 487 (1969).

                        <p>
                            It is not required that zoning district lines coincide with property lines, regardless of the area involved. Penny v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 596</cite>, 107 S.E.2d 72 (1959).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To hold that zoning district lines must coincide with property lines, regardless of area involved, would be to render the act largely ineffective. Heaton v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 506</cite>, 178
                            S.E.2d 352 (1971).

                            Restrictions on Use Must Be Uniform in All Areas in Same Class. - When a city adopts a zoning ordinance, restrictions on use must be uniform in all areas in a defined class or district. Decker v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite>                            102, 169 S.E.2d 487 (1969).

                        <p>
                            When a classification of a zone has been made, all the areas in each class must be subject to the same restrictions. Allred v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 530</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 432 (1971).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            The regulations prescribed shall be uniform for each class or kind of building throughout each district, but the regulations of one district may differ from those of the others. Bizzell v. Board of Aldermen, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 364</cite>,
                            135 S.E. 58 (1926).

                        <p>
                            How Cases Determined. - In one part of a district a filling station may be noxious or offensive to the public within the purview of the ordinance and in another part it may not be; at one place it may menace the public safety and at another it may not.
                            Conditions and probable results must be taken into account. Thus, while the board of adjustment passes on individual cases, each case is determined in the contemplation of the statute and the ordinance by a uniform rule. Harden

                            Practice of conditional use zoning is an approved practice in North Carolina, so long as the action of the local zoning authority in accomplishing the zoning is reasonable, neither arbitrary nor unduly discriminatory, and in the public interest. Chrismon
                            v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Exceptions Or Decreased Standards. - There was no merit to an argument that G.S. 160A-382 did not permit exceptions or decreased standards. Rakestraw v. Town of Knightdale, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 129, 654
                            S.E.2d 825 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 237</cite>, 659 S.E.2d 739 (2008).

                        <p>
                            When Consent of Property Owners Required. - Conditional use zoning authorized by this section requires the consent of all the property owners within the area to be rezoned, and the only use which can be made of the land which is conditionally rezoned
                            is that which is specified in the conditional use permit. Rezoning from one general use district with listed permitted uses to another general use district does not require the consent of such property owners and does not limit
                            the future use of the property to a specific use, but allows changes from one permitted use to any other use permitted in the new zone. Hall v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 293</cite>,
                            372 S.E.2d 564, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 629</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 586 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Principal differences between valid conditional use zoning and illegal contract zoning are related and are essentially two in number: First, valid conditional use zoning features merely a unilateral promise from the landowner to the local zoning authority
                            as to the landowner's intended use of the land in question, while illegal contract zoning anticipates a bilateral contract in which the landowner and the zoning authority make reciprocal promises. Second, in the context of
                            conditional use zoning, the local zoning authority maintains its independent decision-making authority, while in the contract zoning scenario, it abandons that authority by binding itself contractually with the landowner seeking
                            a zoning amendment. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is not necessary that property rezoned to a conditional use district be available for all of the uses allowed under the corresponding general use district. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>,
                            370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Spot zoning is not invalid per se, but rather, it is beyond the authority of the municipality or county and therefore void only in the absence of a clear showing of a reasonable basis therefor. Chrismon v. Guilford County,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).
                                <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Spot Zoning Held Legal. - While the rezoning of two tracts from A-1 to CU-M-2, so as to allow the storage and sale of agricultural chemicals, constituted a form of spot zoning, this activity was not illegal spot zoning. Because of the substantial benefits
                            created for the surrounding community by the rezoning and because of the close relationship between the likely uses of the rezoned property and the uses already present in the surrounding tracts, there was a clear showing of
                            a reasonable basis for the spot zoning. Chrismon v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 611</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 579 (1988).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rezoning Held Invalid as Contract Zoning. - Where city council considered a proposed development plan, as well as collateral representations concerning adjacent property and deed restrictions controlling future use of the rezoned site, but did not determine
                            the suitability of the land for other uses of the classification in question, the challenged rezoning constituted unlawful contract zoning. Hall v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite>                            53, 362 S.E.2d 791 (1987), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 293</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 564 (1988).

                        <p>
                            No Zoning Power Over School's Parking Lot. - Rocky Mount Board of Adjustment had no authority to require a special use permit on the part of the Nash-Rocky Mount Board of Education with regard to its erection of a parking lot, because a parking lot was
                            not a building or the use of a building as that term was provided for in the 2003 version of G.S. 160A-392 applicable to the matter; therefore, the Board of Adjustment had no zoning power and no special use permit was needed.

                                public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.

                    The regulations may provide that defined minor modifications to special use permits that do not involve a change in uses permitted or the density of overall development permitted may be reviewed and approved administratively. Any other modification or
                    revocation of a special use permit shall follow the same process for approval as is applicable to the approval of a special use permit. If multiple parcels of land are subject to a special use permit, the owners of individual parcels
                    may apply for permit modification so long as the modification would not result in other properties failing to meet the terms of the special use permit or regulations. Any modifications approved apply only to those properties whose
                    owners apply for the modification. The regulation may require that special use permits be recorded with the register of deeds.

                    No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Any other development regulation that regulates land use or development
                    may provide for variances from the provisions of those ordinances consistent with the provisions of this subsection.

                    A local government may by ordinance regulate the subdivision of land within its planning and development regulation jurisdiction. In addition to final plat approval, the regulation may include provisions for review and approval of sketch plans and preliminary
                    plats. The regulation may provide for different review procedures for different classes of subdivisions. Decisions on approval or denial of preliminary or final plats may be made only on the basis of standards explicitly set forth
                    in the subdivision or unified development ordinance.

                        Limitation on Authority of County Commissioners to Adopt Subdivision Control Ordinance. - The authority of a board of county commissioners to adopt a subdivision control ordinance may be lawfully exercised only within prescribed limitations. Thus, a subdivision
                        ordinance adopted by the board of county commissioners applies solely to land lying within the county and outside the subdivision-regulation jurisdiction of any municipality. State v. McBane, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>,
                        170 S.E.2d 913 (1969), decided under former law.

                    <p>
                        Failure to Follow Quasi-Judicial Process. - Where ordinance adopted by city required the city to use a quasi-judicial process when reviewing an application to develop property, council's decision denying a developer's application to build affordable housing
                        would be reversed, because the council did not use fair-trial standards in reaching its decision and did not state the facts upon which it based its decision with sufficient specificity that the appellate court could review the
                        decision to determine if it was lawful. Guilford Fin. Servs., LLC v. City of Brevard, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 563 S.E.2d 27 (2002).

                        Conditions on Approval of Subdivision Plan. - Merely changing the location of a recreation area as a condition of approval of a subdivision plan does not amount to a taking so as to require compensation and is a valid exercise of a municipality's police
                        power under G.S. 160A-372. Messer v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 692, 297 S.E.2d 632 (1982), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 697</cite>,

                        Performance Bonds. - Successor developer could not compel a city to enforce a performance bond obtained by a prior developer to guarantee infrastructure improvements because no statute or ordinance authorized such relief or specified circumstances under
                        which the city had to enforce a performance guarantee, nor was such a duty implied. Brookline Residential, LLC v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 796 S.E.2d 369 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Denial of Subdivision Application. - Denial of a property owner's subdivision application was properly reversed because the property owner complied with the general and technical requirements of the town's subdivision ordinance since substantial evidence
                        did not support findings regarding overcrowding of schools, increased traffic, and incompatibility with the existing neighborhood; also, remand for clarification of subjective criteria in the ordinance was reasonable. Blue Ridge
                        Co., L.L.C. v. Town of Pineville, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 466, 655 S.E.2d 843, review denied, review dismissed, as moot, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 679</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 742 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Ordinance Invalid. - Trial court erred in granting a county summary in developers action seeking, among other things, an order declaring an Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) null and void because the county used the APFO to impermissibly shift
                        a portion of the burden for funding school construction onto developers seeking approval for new developments, and it could not use the APFO to obtain indirectly the payment of what amounted to an impact fee given that it lacked
                        the authority to impose school impact fees directly; nowhere within G.S. 153A-330 through 153A-335 does not the General Assembly authorize a county to adopt a land use regulation ordinance pursuant to which a developer may be forced
                        to make a payment of money, donate land, or provide for school construction. Union Land Owners Ass'n v. County of Union, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 689 S.E.2d 504 (2009).

                            of land falls, without question under this exception. Three Guys Real Estate v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 468</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 681 (1997).

                            Immunity. - Trial court properly entered summary judgment to a county and town because they were engaged in a governmental function, were not subject to a statutory time limitation, and the town had standing to enforce certain subdivision bonds because
                            the power to issue subdivision control ordinances was geographically limited, nothing restricted the assignability of the bonds, the county was authorized to enact subdivision control ordinances, and the bonds did not specify

                            Ordinance Invalid. - Trial court erred in granting a county summary in developers action seeking, among other things, an order declaring an Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) null and void because the county used the APFO to impermissibly shift
                            a portion of the burden for funding school construction onto developers seeking approval for new developments, and it could not use the APFO to obtain indirectly the payment of what amounted to an impact fee given that it lacked
                            the authority to impose school impact fees directly; nowhere within G.S. 153A-330 through 153A-335 does not the General Assembly authorize a county to adopt a land use regulation ordinance pursuant to which a developer may
                            be forced to make a payment of money, donate land, or provide for school construction. Union Land Owners Ass'n v. County of Union, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 689 S.E.2d 504 (2009).

                            Conditions on Approval of Subdivision Plan. - Merely changing the location of a recreation area as a condition of approval of a subdivision plan does not amount to a taking so as to require compensation and is a valid exercise of a municipality's police
                            power under this section. Messer v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 692, 297 S.E.2d 632 (1982), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 697</cite>,

                            Assuming, a city's Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) was a subdivision control ordinance within the scope of the statute the ordinance's provision for a public facilities fee had not been specifically authorized by the General Assembly; there
                            were no provisions in the statute authorizing the city to make its development approval contingent on securing funds to subsidize its law enforcement, fire protection, and parks, which was the stated purpose of the APFO. China

                            Performance Bonds. - Successor developer could not compel a city to enforce a performance bond obtained by a prior developer to guarantee infrastructure improvements because no statute or ordinance authorized such relief or specified circumstances under
                            which the city had to enforce a performance guarantee, nor was such a duty implied. Brookline Residential, LLC v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 796 S.E.2d 369

                            nor unconstitutionally vague. Batch v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 1</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 655, cert. denied, 496 U.S. 931, 110 S. Ct. 2631, 110 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1990).

         Town Did Not Have Authority to Pay for Services.
        </b> - Because G.S. 160A-372 allowed municipalities to enact ordinances permitting performance guarantee for the successful "completion" of the installation of infrastructure, and not the payment for such installation,
                            the town's ordinance did not allow for the use of the letter of credit funds for payment of contractor invoices for work performed. Huntley Constr. Co. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (In re Versant Props., LLC), - F. Supp. 2d -

                            Summary Judgment Found In Error. - The trial court's grant of summary judgment for defendant, implicitly finding as a matter of law that defendant could compel plaintiffs to construct access roads, was error where: defendant-town had no authority under
                            this section to require plaintiffs to pave, curb and gutter streets abutting their subdivision because these streets were not within plaintiffs' subdivision; where plaintiffs were not fee simple owners of the roads deeded as
                            a right-of-way to the State Highway Commission; and where there was no evidence that the defendants sought funds from the plaintiffs for road construction although they had that option. Buckland v. Town of Haw River,

                        date shall be set one year from the date the bond is issued, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for the required improvements necessitates a longer duration.

                        the performance guarantee or use a cost estimate determined by the developer. The reasonably estimated cost of completion shall include one hundred percent (100%) of the costs for labor and materials necessary for completion of
                        the required improvements. Where applicable, the costs shall be based on unit pricing. The additional twenty-five percent (25%) allowed under this subdivision includes inflation and all costs of administration regardless of how

     §
    
</span> 153-266.6. - The sole purpose of former G.S. 153-266.6, similar to this section, was to compel compliance with ordinance provisions seeking to prevent any subdivision of land covered by its terms unless and until the
                            proposed subdivision map had been submitted to and approved by designated governmental agencies. State v. McBane, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 913 (1969).

                            What former G.S. 153-266.6 condemned as a misdemeanor was the description of land in any contract of sale, deed or other instrument of transfer by reference to a subdivision plat that had not been properly approved and recorded. State v. McBane,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 913 (1969).

                            Recording of Instrument Containing Improper Reference Immaterial. - The misdemeanor defined in former G.S. 153-266.6 related to a sale or transfer of land with reference to a plat showing a subdivision of land before such plat had been properly approved
                            under the ordinance and recorded in the office of the appropriate register of deeds. Whether the contract of sale, deed or other instrument of transfer was recorded was immaterial. State v. McBane,

                            Ordinance Regulating Subdivision of Land Prerequisite to Conviction. - As one of the prerequisites to conviction for sale of land by reference to an unapproved plat, it must be alleged and established that an ordinance regulating the subdivision of land
                            was adopted by the board of county commissioners in accordance with the authority conferred by statute. State v. McBane, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 913 (1969).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Person Subject to Prosecution. - The owner of land or his agent within the "platting jurisdiction" granted the county commissioners by statute was the only person subject to criminal prosecution for the sale of land by reference to an unapproved plat.
                            State v. McBane, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 913 (1969).

                            Warrant Must Allege That Defendant Was Land Owner or Owner's Agent Within Platting District. - A warrant is fatally defective if it fails to allege one of the essential elements of the criminal offense, namely, that defendant was the owner of land or
                            his agent within the platting jurisdiction granted to the county commissioners by the statute. State v. McBane, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 913 (1969).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            General allegation that defendant's conduct constituted a misdemeanor in violation of the statute was insufficient. State v. McBane, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 913 (1969).

                            or correct the violation of a zoning ordinance. Town of Nags Head v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 627</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 394 (1985).

                            Enforcement of Subdivision Ordinances. - Although the Town of Nags Head may deny a building permit to applicants whose property violates zoning ordinances, as authorized by G.S. 3.08 of the Nags Head Code of Ordinances and by G.S. 160A-389, its enforcement
                            of subdivision ordinances is restricted to the penal and injunctive relief of this section and G.S. 17.10 of the Code of Ordinances. Town of Nags Head v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 627</cite>,
                            336 S.E.2d 394 (1985).

                            Town was entitled to seek an injunction against real estate developers, pursuant to G.S. 160A-375 and G.S. 160A-389, requiring the developers to comply with a zoning ordinance for the establishment of a minipark and an open space in a real estate subdivision
                            as the developers did not point to any inequities resulting from the injunction itself. Town of Pinebluff v. Marts, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 659, 673 S.E.2d 740 (2009).

                        County Exceeded Statutory Authority With Regard to Zoning Regulations for Manufactured Homes. - County exceeded the power the general assembly conferred upon it with regard to zoning regulations for manufactured homes because an ordinance, as amended,

                        and that wealth based criterion was neither an appearance nor dimensional criteria; G.S. 160A-383.1, as made applicable to counties by G.S. 153A-341.1, limits a county's power to enact zoning regulations for manufactured homes,

                        or site. A local government may not require information that concerns the specific need for the wireless support structure, including if the service to be provided from the wireless support structure is to add additional wireless
                        coverage or additional wireless capacity. A local government may not require proprietary, confidential, or other business information to justify the need for the new wireless support structure, including propagation maps and telecommunication
                        traffic studies. In reviewing an application, the local government may review the following:

                    A local government may create an inspection department and may appoint inspectors who may be given appropriate titles, such as building inspector, electrical inspector, plumbing inspector, housing inspector, zoning inspector, heating and air-conditioning
                    inspector, fire prevention inspector, or deputy or assistant inspector, or such other titles as may be generally descriptive of the duties assigned. Every local government shall perform the duties and responsibilities set forth in

                    or more other units of local government, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t160Da11s160D-1105" target="_self">G.S. 160D-1105</a></cite> or Part 1 of Article 20 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 160A</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes, (iii) contracting with another unit of local government for the provision of inspection services pursuant to Part 1 of Article 20 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 160A</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes, or (iv) arranging for the county in which a city is located to perform inspection services within the city's jurisdiction as authorized by G.S. 160D-1105 and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t160Da02s160D-202" target="_self">G.S. 160D-202</a></cite>.

                <p>
                    In the event that any local government fails to provide inspection services or ceases to provide such services, the Commissioner of Insurance shall arrange for the provision of such services, either through personnel employed by the department or through
                    an arrangement with other units of government. In either event, the Commissioner shall have and may exercise within the local government's planning and development regulation jurisdiction all powers made available to the governing
                    board with respect to building inspection under this Article and Part 1 of Article 20 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 160A</a></cite> of the General Statutes.
                    Whenever the Commissioner has intervened in this manner, the local government may assume provision of inspection services only after giving the Commissioner two years' written notice of its intention to do so; provided, however, that
                    the Commissioner may waive this requirement or permit assumption at an earlier date upon finding that such earlier assumption will not unduly interfere with arrangements made for the provision of those services.

                        Local Laws Providing for Performance of Inspections Unconstitutional. - Inspections pursuant to the State Building Code affect health and sanitation, thus acts that altered the legislative directive of this section that the city shall determine who will
                        perform the inspections under the Code were local legislation that shifted responsibility for enforcement of laws affecting the health of the public and were barred under Art. II,

                        Acts Shifting Responsibility for Inspections Created Unreasonable Classification. - No rational basis justified the separation of New Bern from all other cities in North Carolina for special legislative attention regarding the designation of an appropriate
                        inspection department, and acts which shifted the responsibility for enforcing the building code from New Bern to Craven County created an unreasonable classification and were therefore local acts. City of New Bern v. New Bern-Craven

                        Failure of City to Provide Inspection Services. - Section 160A-411 does not mandate that the city and the county must agree regarding the provision of inspection services; rather, it provides the options available to the city in determining who shall
                        perform the inspections, one of which is arranging for the county to perform them, and if the city fails to provide inspection services via any of the four options, the statute dictates that the Commissioner of Insurance shall
                        arrange for the provision of the services. The legislature does not need to intervene in the process should the county and the city fail to agree; instead, the legislature has provided that the Commissioner of Insurance shall do

                        Liability of Building Inspector. - The chief building inspector of the city of Wilmington was a "public official" of the city, who was engaged in the performance of governmental duties involving the exercise of judgment and discretion in determining whether
                        plaintiffs' greenhouses were constructed in compliance with the applicable law; therefore, he could not be liable to plaintiffs in an action based on his inspection of plaintiffs' greenhouses where there was neither sufficient
                        allegation nor forecast of evidence that he acted maliciously or corruptly or outside of and beyond the scope of his duties, and summary judgment dismissing the action as to him was proper. Pigott v. City of Wilmington,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 401, 273 S.E.2d 752, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 181</cite>, 280 S.E.2d 453 (1981).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While this Part and N.C. Building Code G.S. 105 imposed a duty on the part of the city and its building inspectors to properly carry out enumerated enforcement powers, such powers fell within the city's statutory police powers, and consequently, the duty
                        owed was not to the plaintiffs, individually, but to the general public; there being no duty owed to plaintiffs, their allegations charging city building inspector with negligence clearly did not state a claim upon which relief
                        could be granted. Lynn v. Overlook Dev., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 75, 389 S.E.2d 609 (1990).

                    <p>
                        The trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs' complaint in that, as a matter of law, the acts or omissions of a city building inspector did not cause the damages of which plaintiffs complained, that is, their purchase of a house that was unfit
                        for habitation. Lynn v. Overlook Dev., <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 689</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 469 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Building inspector who was not the chief building inspector was a public official. His position was created by statute, in that position he exercised a portion of the sovereign power delegated to him, through the county, by statute, and work in his official
                        capacity required that he exercise discretion. McCoy v. Coker, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 311, 620 S.E.2d 691 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Special Duty Exception. - To bring themselves within the special duty exception to the public duty doctrine, plaintiffs must show that an actual promise was made to create the special duty, the promise was reasonably relied upon by plaintiffs, and that
                        the plaintiffs' injury was causally related to such reliance. Sinning v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 515, 459 S.E.2d 71 (1995), overruled as stated in Multiple Claimants v. N.C. HHS,

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The provisions of G.S. 160A-411 et seq. and the North Carolina State Building Code did not create a special duty owed by defendants to plaintiffs over and above the duty owed to the general public; thus, the allegations of plaintiffs' complaint were insufficient
                        to state a claim for relief for negligence. Sinning v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 515, 459 S.E.2d 71 (1995), overruled as stated in Multiple Claimants v. N.C. HHS, Div. of Facility
                        Detention Srvs., <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. App.</cite> 278, 626 S.E.2d 666 (2006) (as to the application of the Public Duty doctrine to negligent inspection claims not involving law enforcement departments).

                    <p>
                        Exception Not Shown. - Dismissal of plaintiffs' negligence action against building inspector and county was proper where plaintiff homeowners did not fall within either exception to the public duty doctrine as they did not show a special relationship
                        or special duty between themselves and the defendants. Moseley v. L &amp; L Constr., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 472 S.E.2d 172 (1996).

                        A building permit shall be in writing and shall contain a provision that the work done shall comply with the North Carolina State Building Code and all other applicable State and local laws. Nothing in this section requires a local government to review

                        Effect of Issuance of Permit on Owner's Rights. - If a property owner, in good faith, makes expenditures in reliance on a building permit issued to him, his right to construct the building will be protected as an existing use upon later amendment of the
                        municipal zoning regulations; however, the mere issuance of a building permit alone creates no property right in him, and he may not remain inactive and thereby deny the municipality the right to make needed changes in its ordinances.

                        Mandamus Held Proper Remedy. - Where a city, under an ordinance, with legislative authority in such matters, issued a permit to build an additional room to a residence, but thereafter recalled the permit pending the settlement of a dispute as to whether
                        it would be situated upon an alley claimed to have been widened, upon the finding by the jury that the alley had not been widened and that the room would not be thereon, mandamus was the proper remedy, though the form of the issue
                        was incorrect. Clinard v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 356</cite>, 91 S.E. 1039 (1917).

                        Demolition of Building Properly Ordered. - A municipality complied with the procedures set forth in G.S. 160A-424 to 160A-429 prior to ordering the demolition of a building where (1) the municipality's code enforcement official conducted an inspection
                        of the property based on reason to believe the property was in dangerous condition and, upon inspection, found the property to be unsafe and posted notice of the dangerous character of the property, (2) after nearly a full month
                        passed and no corrective action was taken, the official sent the plaintiffs a notice of hearing, (3) the official then held a hearing and determined that the property should be demolished, based on the length of time the property
                        had been in unsafe condition and the unlikelihood that the plaintiffs would actually take sufficient steps to improve the property, and (4) the order was appealed and affirmed after two separate hearings. Coffey v. Town of Waynesville,
                        <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 624, 547 S.E.2d 132 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Superior court did not err by determining that the decision of a town board of commissioners to demolish an owner's motel was supported by substantial evidence because the evidence of record received at the hearing before the board showed that storms,
                        erosion, tidal action and/or other natural events materially changed the property upon which the structure was located, those changes and the resulting impact on the structure created a hazard, and the structure attracted criminal
                        activity. Six at 109, LCC v. Town of Holden Beach, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 767 S.E.2d 400 (2014).

                        Superior court did not err in upholding the decision of a town board of commissioners, which affirmed the demolition of an owner's motel. because the board acted within its statutory authority and after a de novo hearing; the respective orders of the
                        town building inspector and the board made it clear that the structure was condemned because it was determined to be unsafe, and those orders were proper. Six at 109, LCC v.

                        No Compensation Due. - Plaintiff was collaterally estopped from seeking compensation for a city's demolition of its building, as the issue in the case - whether the building was a fire, health, or safety hazard under G.S. 160A-429 - had been decided adversely
                        to plaintiff in a prior, quasi-judicial administrative hearing, and it had a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue, but elected not to do so. Hillsboro Partners, LLC v. City of Fayetteville,

                        Standard of Review. - In reviewing a municipality's decision ordering demolition of a building, if the petitioner contends that the decision was based on an error of law, de novo review is the proper standard of review, but if the petitioner contends
                        the decision was not supported by the evidence or was arbitrary and capricious, then the reviewing court must apply the whole record test. Coffey v. Town of Waynesville, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite>                        624, 547 S.E.2d 132 (2001).

                        Liability for Torts of Officers. - A municipality was not immune from liability for the torts of defendant officers to the extent of defendant town's liability insurance.

                        Reasonableness of Ordinances. - While it might be unreasonable to prohibit even the slightest repairs to wooden buildings standing within the fire limits prior to the passage of a statute or ordinance establishing such limits, the power to prevent repairs
                        is delegated and presumably exercised for the protection of property; hence, where a wooden structure within the bounds is partially destroyed by fire already, it is not unreasonable to require a new roof to be made of material
                        less liable to combustion, or to forbid the repairs altogether when the damage to the building is serious, and to that end to compel the owners to give notice to the town authorities of their purpose to repair, and of the character
                        of the contemplated work. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 846</cite>, 19 S.E. 599 (1894), decided under former similar provisions.

                        to the amount and procedure. In the notice of public sale authorized under this subsection, it is sufficient to describe the property by a street address and reference to the book and page or other location where the property deed
                        is registered. Prior to any sale under this subsection, the applicants to bid in the public sale or the proposed buyer in the private sale shall demonstrate the ability and experience needed to rehabilitate the property within
                        a reasonable time. After deducting the expenses of the sale, the amount of outstanding taxes and other government assessments, and the amount of the receiver's lien, the receiver shall apply any remaining proceeds of the sale first
                        to the city's costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and then to the liens against the property in order of priority. Any remaining proceeds shall be remitted to the property owner.

        Constitutionality Generally.
       </b> - It is not unconstitutional for a municipality to take upon itself a duty to see that repairs to buildings within its domain will be made in such manner as will prevent fire and structural hazards. This duty it is
                        bound to exercise to protect the safety and health of the general public. To require a permit in order to implement such reasonable supervision is not in violation of any provision of the Constitution of the United States. Walker

                        Unconstitutional Action by Municipality. - An action by a municipality, pursuant to an ordinance adopted under the authority of former G.S. 160-182, in ordering the demolition of a dwelling house without compensation to the owner thereof, and in charging
                        the expense of demolition to the owner upon his failure to demolish the house himself, such action being based upon findings by the city building inspector that the house was unfit for human habitation and that the repairs necessary
                        to bring the house into conformity with the housing code would cost 60% or more of the present value of the house, was violative of the law of the land clause of the State Constitution, where (1) the house could be repaired so
                        as to comply with the housing code, and (2) the owner was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to repair the house. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970).

                        A homeowner who was faced with a municipal housing inspector's order giving him no alternative but to demolish his home, declared uninhabitable by the municipality, or to pay the expense of demolition by the municipality, was not required to propose an
                        alternative remedy for the condition of the house before asserting his constitutional right in the courts. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970).

                        Public Interference Warranted Only to Secure Public Safety or Protect Health. - The only warrant for public interference with a person's building is to secure public safety and to protect the health of those occupying the building. Horton v. Gulledge,

                        City May Not Destroy Private Property for Aesthetic Reasons Alone. - A municipal corporation has no inherent police power, but may exercise such power only to the extent that it has been conferred upon the city by statute. Moreover, the legislature cannot
                        confer upon a city a power which the legislature, itself, does not have. Consequently, a city may not, under the guise of the police power, destroy private property for aesthetic reasons alone. Horton v. Gulledge,

                        without giving her notice, as the condition of the house did not pose an imminent threat to the public, warranting its immediate demolition; accordingly, the appellate court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for an entry

                        Compensation to Owner Not Required. - The police power of the State, which it may delegate to its municipal corporations, extends to the prohibition of a use of private property which may reasonably be deemed to threaten the public health, safety, or
                        morals or the general welfare, and when necessary to safeguard such public interest, such power may be exercised without payment of compensation to the owner, even though his property is thereby rendered substantially worthless.

                        Civil action. - If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling, the public officer may file a civil action in the name of the local government to remove such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature of summary

                        time, date, and place not to exceed 10 days from the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. 42-29. If the summons appears to have been duly served and if at

                        a dwelling who is a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this paragraph unless such occupant was served with notice at least 30 days before the filing of the summary ejectment
                        proceeding that the governing board has ordered the public officer to proceed to exercise his duties under subdivisions (4) and (5) of this section to vacate and close or remove and demolish the dwelling.

                        Three-Year Delay Between Order to Repair and Order to Demolish Entitled Owner to New Hearing. - An order to repair is issued after a determination that repairs can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling; an order to demolish
                        involves a different determination, namely, that the repairs cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling; therefore, where city's demolition order was issued almost three years after the city held
                        a hearing and issued its order to repair, plaintiff was entitled to another hearing on the issue of demolition. Newton v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 446, 374 S.E.2d

                        Failure to Provide Notice and Hearing Before Demolition. - Where city acted without authority in ordering the demolition of plaintiff's building without affording plaintiff notice and an opportunity to be heard as required by statute, the city acted at
                        its peril in failing to exercise its powers in the manner prescribed by the statute, and thus was liable to plaintiff for any provable damages. Newton v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite>                        446, 374 S.E.2d 488 (1988).

                        Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the city on the homeowner's claim for violation of her due process rights because, although the homeowner's house was in severe disrepair, the city violated her due process rights by demolishing the home
                        without giving her notice, as the condition of the house did not pose an imminent threat to the public, warranting its immediate demolition; accordingly, the appellate court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for an entry

                        Although a son of mobile home owners claimed to have an ownership interest in the mobile homes, the son's due process rights were not violated when the city did not send him notice of proceedings relating to the demolition of the mobile homes because
                        the son's ownership interest did not appear anywhere in the public record, G.S. 160A-442(4) and G.S. 160A-443(2), and the city did not have to conduct an investigation to uncover whether there were owners other than those appearing
                        of record. Patterson v. City of Gastonia, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 725 S.E.2d 82 (2012).

                        Mobile home owners were not denied due process under the North Carolina Constitution when a city did not give them notice of a city council meeting wherein an ordinance of demolition was passed because the owners had an adequate alternative state remedy
                        under G.S. 160A-446, including administrative appeals and the right to seek injunctive relief, but the owners did not pursue the alternative remedies; the city council was not required under G.S. 160A-443(5) to conduct an evidentiary
                        hearing prior to passing the ordinance ordering demolition. Patterson v. City of Gastonia, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 725 S.E.2d 82 (2012).

                        Proof of actual notice was irrelevant to plaintiff's right to recover damages against city for failing to comply with statutory procedures before demolishing plaintiff's building; therefore, the trial court's instruction to the jury that it could find
                        that the city used reasonable diligence to provide actual notice and thus absolve city of its liability for damages even though city failed to serve plaintiff as required by G.S. 160A-445, was error. Newton v. City of Winston-Salem,

                        the cost of removal or demolition, and where owners claimed that mobile homes and contents removed from their property had value, but the town claimed they did not, summary judgment was improper. Town of Hertford v. Harris,

                        Although there was no genuine issue of fact as to what steps a city took in attempting to ascertain to whom they should send notice of condemnation of property, reasonable minds could differ as to whether the steps taken to find the actual owners were
                        sufficient under G.S. 160A-443. Therefore, the city was not entitled to summary judgment. Lawyer v. City of Elizabeth, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 304, 681 S.E.2d 415, review denied,

                        note held by the other plaintiff, summary judgment was improperly granted for city where one of the questions raised by city's motion therefor was whether its building inspector used "reasonable diligence" in attempting to locate

                        Failure to Provide Notice and Hearing Before Demolition. - Where city acted without authority in ordering the demolition of plaintiff's building without affording plaintiff notice and an opportunity to be heard as required by statute, the city acted at
                        its peril in failing to exercise its powers in the manner prescribed by the statute, and thus was liable to plaintiff for any provable damages. Newton v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite>                        446, 374 S.E.2d 488 (1988).

                        Proof of actual notice was irrelevant to plaintiff's right to recover damages against city for failing to comply with statutory procedures before demolishing plaintiff's building; therefore, the trial court's instruction to the jury that it could find
                        that the city used reasonable diligence to provide actual notice and thus absolve city of its liability for damages even though city failed to serve plaintiff as required by this section, was error. Newton v. City of Winston-Salem,
                        <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 446, 374 S.E.2d 488 (1988).

                        and secured under a promissory note held by the other plaintiff, summary judgment was improperly granted for city where one of the questions raised by city's motion therefor was whether its building inspector used "reasonable diligence"

                        Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the inspection department may make periodic inspections only when there is reasonable cause to believe that unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise hazardous or unlawful conditions may exist in a residential
                        building or structure. However, when the inspection department determines that a safety hazard exists in one of the dwelling units within a multifamily building, which in the opinion of the inspector poses an immediate threat to
                        the occupant, the inspection department may inspect, in the absence of a specific complaint and actual knowledge of the unsafe condition, additional dwelling units in the multifamily building to determine if that same safety hazard
                        exists. For purposes of this section, the term "reasonable cause" means any of the following: (i) the landlord or owner has a history of more than two verified violations of the housing ordinances or codes within a 12-month period,
                        (ii) there has been a complaint that substandard conditions exist within the building or there has been a request that the building be inspected, (iii) the inspection department has actual knowledge of an unsafe condition within
                        the building, or (iv) violations of the local ordinances or codes are visible from the outside of the property. In conducting inspections authorized under this section, the inspection department shall not discriminate between single-family
                        and multifamily buildings or between owner-occupied and tenant-occupied buildings. In exercising this power, members of the department shall have a right to enter on any premises within the jurisdiction of the department at all
                        reasonable hours for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action, upon presentation of proper credentials. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit periodic inspections in accordance with State fire prevention

                        An ordinance adopted pursuant to this Article may provide for a housing appeals board as provided by G.S. 160D-305. An appeal from any decision or order of the public officer is a quasi-judicial matter and may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby
                        or by any officer, board, or commission of the local government. Any appeal from the public officer shall be taken within 10 days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order by filing with the public officer and
                        with the housing appeals board a notice of appeal that shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the public officer shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting
                        the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the public officer refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, the decision remains in force until modified or reversed.
                        When any appeal is from a decision of the public officer requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal has the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the board, unless the public officer certifies
                        to the board, after the notice of appeal is filed with the officer, that because of facts stated in the certificate, a copy of which shall be furnished to the appellant, a suspension of the requirement would cause imminent peril
                        to life or property. In that case the requirement is not suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the public officer, by the board, or by a
                        court of record upon petition made pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.

                        wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make any decision and order that in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and, to that end, it has all the powers of the public officer, but the
                        concurring vote of four members of the board is necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the public officer. The board also has power in passing upon appeals, when unnecessary hardships would result from carrying
                        out the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the ordinance is observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice

                        shall be had by the court on a petition within 20 days and shall be given preference over other matters on the court's calendar. The court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall enter such final order or decree as

                        Due Process. - Mobile home owners were not denied due process under the North Carolina Constitution when a city did not give them notice of a city council meeting wherein an ordinance of demolition was passed because the owners had adequate alternative
                        state remedies under G.S. 160A-446, including administrative appeals and the right to seek injunctive relief, but the owners did not pursue the alternative remedies; the city council was not required under G.S. 160A-443(5) to conduct
                        an evidentiary hearing prior to passing the ordinance ordering demolition. Patterson v. City of Gastonia, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 725 S.E.2d 82 (2012).

                        Purpose of writ of certiorari in subsection (e) is to bring the matter before the court, upon the evidence presented by the record itself. Axler v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 212 S.E.2d 510,

                        Exhaustion of Remedies. - Proper course of action for a person aggrieved under a minimum housing ordinance would be to present the case at a minimum housing hearing and then, if the person remained unsatisfied, to appeal that decision to the housing appeals
                        board as permitted by statute. If the appeal to the board was unsuccessful, the person would then have the ability to seek review in superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Cheatham v. Town of Taylortown,

                <p>
                    Any local government may acquire by purchase, gift, grant, devise, lease, or otherwise, the fee or any lesser interest, development right, easement, covenant, or other contractual right of or to real property within its respective jurisdiction, when it
                    finds that the acquisition is necessary to achieve the purposes of this Part. Any local government may also acquire the fee to any property for the purpose of conveying or leasing the property back to its original owner or other person
                    under covenants or other contractual arrangements that will limit the future use of the property in accordance with the purposes of this Part, but when this is done, the property may be conveyed back to its original owner but to no
                    other person by private sale.

                        Applicability. - Neither the board of adjustment nor the zoning change applicant were necessary parties to a marina operator's mandamus action seeking to require the zoning administrator to transmit its appeal of a zoning issue to the board as G.S. 160A-393
                        did not apply. Morningstar Marinas v. Warren County, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 755 S.E.2d 75, review denied, 758 S.E.2d 862, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 411 (2014), aff'd, 777 S.E.2d 733, 2015 N.C.

                        Jurisdiction. - In a zoning dispute, a trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction due to a failure to join a city as a necessary party; moreover, because the city's participation in the proceedings cured the defect in the petition, the trial
                        court did not err in denying a motion to dismiss the petition. MYC Klepper/Brandon Knolls L.L.C. v. Bd. of Adjustment for Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 767 S.E.2d 668 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly dismiss citizens' petition for writ of certiorari on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction because the citizens did not properly perfect their appeal from the decision of the county board of commissioners; the citizens were not the
                        applicant before the decision-making board whose decision was appealed, and thus, under the statute,, they were required to name the applicant as a respondent, which they failed to do. Hirschman v. Chatham Cnty.,

                            class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 349, 792 S.E.2d 211 (2016).

                    <p>
                        In order to avoid the dilemmas the courts have previously faced in attempting to ascertain the required respondents in an appeal of a quasi-judicial decision, the General Assembly specifically listed the required respondents; thus, when an applicant is
                        granted a conditional-use permit and an outsider appeals the decision through a petition for writ of certiorari but does not include the applicant as a respondent in the appeal, the superior court is without jurisdiction to review
                        the merits. Hirschman v. Chatham Cnty., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 349, 792 S.E.2d 211 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Standing. - Landowners had standing to contest a county's approval of a site plan for a proposed law enforcement training facility in an agricultural zone because, (1) when the landowners testified to concerns that the alleged unlawful approval of the
                        facility would increase noise levels, had the potential to result in groundwater and soil contamination, and threatened the safety of anyone on the landowners' property due to stray bullets, resulting in a decrease in the landowners'
                        property values, this evidence was sufficient to establish standing to challenge the proposed land use, and (2) the definition of "competent evidence" in G.S. 160A-393(k)(3), excluding lay opinions as to property values, did not
                        affect an analysis of standing. Fort v. County of Cumberland, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 401, 721 S.E.2d 350, review denied, 735 S.E.2d 180, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 1045 (2012).

                    <p>
                        Appellate court had jurisdiction to review a conditional use permit's denial after the applicant withdrew the application because (1) site owners had standing and continued to seek the permit, and (2) the denial was a reviewable final judgment. Dellinger

                    <p>
                        Proper Respondent. - Superior court properly dismissed a land owner's amended petition for judicial review under writ of certiorari because the town, and not the town's board of adjustment, was statutorily required to be named as the respondent in the
                        owner's petition for judicial review, the owner's initial petition failed to name the town, while his amended petition named the town, it was filed long after the 30-day statute of limitations for appealing such decisions, and
                        the owner's amended petition did not relate back to his initial petition inasmuch as the town did not waived his failure to name it as the respondent in his initial petition by participating in the hearing on the board of adjustment's
                        motion to dismiss. Azar v. Town of Indian Trail Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 809 S.E.2d 17 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Residents had standing to participate in special use permit hearings because (1) the applicable ordinance let any member of the public appear and present evidence, and (2) the applicant agreed to allow the residents to intervene in the reviewing trial
                        court. Little River, LLC v. Lee Cty., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 809 S.E.2d 42 (2017), review denied, 818 S.E.2d 692, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 878 (N.C. 2018).

                    <p>
                        Procedural Bar. - Neighbors were procedurally barred from challenging a county board decision for the first time at the certiorari review hearing where they failed to comply with G.S. 160A-393(c)'s petition filing requirements, thus never perfecting an
                        appeal from that decision, and they never moved to intervene as a petitioner to intervening-respondents' petition for certiorari review of the decision, nor did they file any responsive pleading, raise any written objection, or
                        request any relief from that decision. Jeffries v. Cty. of Harnett, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 817 S.E.2d 36 (2018), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 297</cite>, 826 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Proper Standard of Review. - Trial court conducted a proper review of a decision of a zoning board of adjustment because it conducted a de novo review concerning questions of law, and a "whole record" review concerning issues of fact. Myers Park Homeowners
                        Ass'n v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 204, 747 S.E.2d 338 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a zoning dispute relating to a billboard sign, a trial court applied the correct standard of review when it affirmed the decision of a city's board of adjustment because it applied whole record review and determined that the board's findings were supported
                        by substantial evidence in the record; moreover, the trial court applied de novo review to the questions of law and determined that the board correctly interpreted and applied the applicable provisions of the city Code of Ordinances
                        and did not commit any errors of law. MYC Klepper/Brandon Knolls L.L.C. v. Bd. of Adjustment for Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 767 S.E.2d 668 (2014).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Superior court did not err by determining that the decision of a town board of commissioners to demolish an owner's motel was supported by substantial evidence because the evidence of record received at the hearing before the board showed that storms,
                        erosion, tidal action and/or other natural events materially changed the property upon which the structure was located, those changes and the resulting impact on the structure created a hazard, and the structure attracted criminal
                        activity. Six at 109, LCC v. Town of Holden Beach, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 767 S.E.2d 400 (2014).

                        Trial court properly reviewed the denial of a conditional use permit (CUP) de novo because this was the standard used to determine if a developer showed prima facie entitlement to a CUP. PHG Asheville, LLC v. City of Asheville,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 822 S.E.2d 79 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 133</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 755, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 274 (N.C. 2020).

                    <p>
                        Error by Board in Interpretation of Ordinance. - Town's board of adjustment erred in interpreting a town development ordinance because the board's interpretation of the ordinance superimposed a limitation upon a property owner's fence that was not found
                        in the ordinance. Lipinski v. Town of Summerfield, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 750 S.E.2d 46 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Superior court erred in affirming a county board of adjustment's order because the board improperly concluded that a property owner was in violation of an ordinance; the board improperly concluded that under the amended ordinance, a change in ownership
                        constituted a change in use and that the owner was required to amend its zoning permit to legally continue the same use of the property because the change of ownership had no impact on the use of the property. Starlites Tech Corp.
                        v. Rockingham Cty., - N.C. App. - , 840 S.E.2d 231 (2020).

                        Property owner's challenge to a county board of adjustment's interpretation of an ordinance warranted reversal of the board's ultimate decision because the interpretation constituted an error of law. Starlites Tech Corp. v. Rockingham Cty., - N.C. App.
                        - , 840 S.E.2d 231 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Findings of Fact Not Applicable to Zoning Appeal. - As a trial court sat as an appellate court in an appeal of a decision by a zoning board of adjustment, it did not err in declining to amend and/or alter its order of affirmance in order to issue findings
                        of fact and conclusions of law because civil procedure rules in that regard were not applicable. Myers Park Homeowners Ass'n v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 204, 747 S.E.2d
                        338 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Error In Making Findings of Fact. - Superior court erred in reversing a decision by a county board of adjustment that partially affirmed and modified a notice of violations penalizing the owners for violating a zoning ordinance by operating firing ranges
                        on their property without a site plan and permit because, instead of remanding the case to the board with instructions to make sufficient findings to allow for appellate review or remanding with the instructions necessary to correct
                        an error of law, the superior court overstepped its role as an appellate tribunal by making its own findings of fact regarding how the ranges were used and who used them relevant to the statutory exception, the federal farm exemption,
                        and an exception in the county's firing range amendment. Hampton v. Cumberland Cty., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 656, 808 S.E.2d 763 (2017), cert granted, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 473</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Record Was Adequate. - Record a city provided to the trial court did not deprive homeowners of their right to due process because the record adequately conveyed the substance of the homeowners' missing audio testimony; the record included a copy of the
                        homeowners' appeal, which appeal included inter an affidavit from one of them, and the homeowners did not specifically identify any other competent or substantial evidence that could be missing and that would have prevented the
                        trial court from reviewing their claim. Fehrenbacher v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 768 S.E.2d 186 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Authority to Supplement the Record. - It was not improper for the trial court to request that a telecommunications conglomerate submit photographic simulations of the proposed monopine tower that were included in its original application for the trial
                        court's de novo consideration of whether the board of adjustment erred in ruling that the tower qualified as a concealed wireless communications facility because subsection (j) was not the only provision that vested discretionary
                        authority in the trial court to supplement the record. Fehrenbacher v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 768 S.E.2d 186 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a neighbor's motion to supplement the record to include affidavits by the neighbor and a real estate appraiser addressing the issue of standing, when the neighbor challenged a design application for
                        a house that was submitted by landowners in a historic district, because the affidavits which the neighbor proffered as supplements added very little new substantive information to the already voluminous record and would not have
                        provided a basis for standing. Cherry v. Wiesner, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 781 S.E.2d 871, review denied, 792 S.E.2d 779, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 674 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Erroneous Denial of Conditional Use Permit. - County commissioners erred in denying a conditional use permit (CUP) to build a solar farm because (1) applicants showed prima facie entitlement to a CUP, as a solar farm was a public utility facility permitted
                        in the zone at issue, and they produced a site plan and competent testimony complying with all CUP requirements and competent, material, and substantial evidence showing compliance with more general zoning requirements, and (2)
                        CUP opponents did not meet their burden with speculative and general lay opinions and bare or vague assertions on a matter requiring scientific, technical or other specialized or personal knowledge outside the experience of an
                        ordinary person. Innovative 55, LLC v. Robeson Cty., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 714, 801 S.E.2d 671 (2017).

                        City erroneously denied a developer a conditional use permit because, (1) inter alia, the developer's expert testified a project would not have a detrimental impact on the value of adjacent property, and (2) the city did not offer any contrary expert
                        testimony. PHG Asheville, LLC v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 822 S.E.2d 79 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 133</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 755, 2020 N.C. LEXIS

                        City erroneously denied a developer a conditional use permit because, inter alia, the developer did not fail to show a project was in harmony with the neighborhood, as (1) since the proposed use was a conditional use, it had already been determined that
                        the use was in harmony with the neighborhood, and (2) the developer's expert testified to similar uses in the area. PHG Asheville, LLC v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 231,

                        City erroneously denied a developer a conditional use permit because, inter alia, the developer did not fail to show a project would not cause undue traffic congestion, as the developer's expert so testified, and the city did not offer contrary expert
                        testimony. PHG Asheville, LLC v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 822 S.E.2d 79 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 133</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 755, 2020 N.C. LEXIS

                        City lacked the authority to deny a requested conditional use permit because the applicant presented competent, material, and substantial evidence-through the testimony of architects, an appraiser, a traffic engineer, a certified planner, and the vice
                        president of the applicant-that the applicant's proposed construction of a hotel satisfied the relevant conditional use permit standards set out in the city's unified development ordinance. PHG Asheville, LLC v. City of Asheville,

                        Public Policy Includes Need for Finality in Zoning Matters. - Zoning claims raised important public policy considerations, and there is a strong need for finality with respect to zoning matters so that landowners may use their property without fear of
                        challenge years after zoning has apparently been determined. Pinehurst Area Realty, Inc. v. Village of Pinehurst, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 394 S.E.2d 251 (1990), review denied and appeal

                        attempted to challenge were included in the city's subdivision, rather than its zoning, ordinance, and the limitations period relating to challenges to zoning ordinances set out in G.S. 1-54.1 and G.S. 160A-364.1 did not apply

                        Where every landowner affected by zoning change was informed by letter that planning board would make a recommendation to the board based upon public hearing and where plaintiffs were given a full public hearing on their petition to "downzone" the property
                        at issue, plaintiffs were given proper notice and had the opportunity to remedy their lack of diligence; therefore, the statute of limitations barred plaintiff's action challenging the zoning change. Bryan v. Raynor,

                        Landowner's challenges to zoning ordinance amendments were time-barred under the two-month limitations period of G.S. 160A-364.1; even if an amendment was adopted inconsistent with the notice requirements of G.S. ch. 160A, an action which attacked the
                        validity of the amendment but was commenced in more time than the statutory period from the adoption of the amendment was barred. Templeton v. Town of Boone, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 50,

                        to timely record the map or written description of the ordinance in which it exercised extraterritorial jurisdiction, the plaintiff-store owner was barred from attacking the validity of the ordinance based on procedural grounds
                        by the statute of limitations provided in this section. Potter v. City of Hamlet, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 714, 541 S.E.2d 233, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 379</cite>, 547 S.E.2d 814 (2001).

                        Judicial Review. - While the legal principles involved in the review of zoning issues were relevant as to a review of design guidelines for new structures erected within a town's historic district, the zoning statutes did not limit how an applicant for
                        a certificate of appropriateness was to seek judicial review. Meares v. Town of Beaufort, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 667 S.E.2d 239 (2008).
