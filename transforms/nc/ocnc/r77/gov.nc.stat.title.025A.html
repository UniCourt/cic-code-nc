            Lender Not Engaged in Sale of Goods And Services. - Plaintiff borrowers' contention that bank was "indirectly" engaged in the furnishing of goods and services when it provided loan for a mobile home was supported by neither logic nor the plain language
            of this section. Collins v. Horizon Hous., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 519 S.E.2d 534 (1999).

            Class Actions Allowed. - When the General Assembly has wished to prevent class actions to enforce statutory claims for relief, where the relief sought was personal and penal in nature, it has said so expressly and unequivocally. The failure of the General
            Assembly to expressly prohibit class actions to enforce this statute convinces the Supreme Court that it intended to allow them for such purposes. Crow v. Citicorp Acceptance Co., <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 274</cite>, 354

            of North Carolina on the date of certification who had a Sears revolving charge account governed by this Act that included a balance, as of each debtor's petition date, which represented the credit purchases of at least two items of personal

     This section was drafted for the protection of both merchant and consumer,

     Section clearly places the burden of apportionment of payments upon the seller.
    </b> If the creditor-seller wishes to avail itself of the benefits of this statute, the creditor-seller must apportion the debtor-purchaser's payments when they are made and not wait for litigation to ensue. It would even seem appropriate
            for the retail installment contract or purchase-money instrument to provide for the apportionment of payments as specified in the statute so that the debtor-purchaser would be fully informed of the fact that the creditor-seller intends to
            exercise its rights under this statute in the event of default. Otherwise, the merchants might be inclined to assert a security interest in an item of property to the full extent of the total debt even though there was only a lesser sum owed
            on the balance of the purchase price of that item of property. Dossenbach's of Clinton, Inc. v. Bartelt (In re Beasley), 23 Bankr. 404 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1982).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     The apportionment requirements of this section inherently recognize the continuing purchase money nature of installment sale contracts which are consolidated
    </b> in that payments must be applied to the various contracts in the same proportion or ratio as the original cash prices in the various contracts bear to one another. Schewel Furn. Co. v. Goard, 26 Bankr. 316 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1982).

            Payments Must Be Applied as Stated in Subsection (b). - As <cite class="octn"><a href="#t25As25A-31ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 25A-31(b)</a></cite> reveals, the only statutory requirement governing the terms of refinancing or consolidation agreements
            is that the agreements must be in writing, dated, and signed by the parties. However, upon consolidation of two or more installment sale contracts, the seller must apply payments as set out in subsection (b) of this section. The purpose of
            such application is to permit a determination of the amount of the debt secured by each of the various security agreements. A similar application is required where a seller in a consumer credit sale makes a subsequent sale to a buyer and takes
            a security interest in goods previously purchased by the buyer from the seller. Schewel Furn. Co. v. Goard, 26 Bankr. 316 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1982).

            only their own purchase price but also the payment of finance charges on items bought later was an agreement that created a security interest in previously purchased property, and thereby required compliance with the apportionment provisions

            Referral Sale. - In essence, a referral sale is a transaction in which a person is induced to purchase goods or services upon the representation that the purchaser can reduce or recover the purchase price or earn a commission by referring other prospective
            buyers to the seller for similar purchases. Chapel Hill Spa Health Club, Inc. v. Goodman, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 368 S.E.2d 60 (1988).

        <p>
            Referral Sales Condemned. - In recognition of the vast potential for deception and exploitation of the public inherent in referral sales and in furtherance of the vital state interest in protecting citizens from fraud, our legislature, by enacting this
            section, has condemned all referral sales contracts, declaring them both unlawful and unenforceable. Chapel Hill Spa Health Club, Inc. v. Goodman, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 368 S.E.2d 60 (1988).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Fact that contingency in referral contract related to price of renewal rather than original membership was of little significance, since in either circumstance the promise of something for nothing would serve as the incentive to make a purchase. Chapel
            Hill Spa Health Club, Inc. v. Goodman, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 368 S.E.2d 60 (1988).

        <p>
            Where spa represented to purchaser, in effect, that if she purchased an initial membership, she could then obtain an additional year or years of membership free by referring an adequate number of prospects to the spa, this transaction clearly constituted
            a sale of services with other consideration to the purchaser that is contingent upon the procurement of prospective customers provided by the purchaser. Thus, the contract between purchaser and the spa constituted a referral sale, in violation
            of this section, and was void and unenforceable. Chapel Hill Spa Health Club, Inc. v. Goodman, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 368 S.E.2d 60 (1988).
