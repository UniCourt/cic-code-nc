        <p>
            A purchaser's right to exercise an option to purchase property under an option contract cannot be forfeited unless a breach has occurred in one or more of the purchaser's express obligations under the option contract and the option contract provides that
            as a result of such breach the seller is entitled to forfeit the contract. Notwithstanding any option contract or covered lease agreement provisions to the contrary, the purchaser's rights shall not be forfeited until the purchaser has been
            notified of the intent to forfeit in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t47Gs47G-5" target="_self">G.S. 47G-5</a></cite> and been given a right to cure the default and has failed to do so within the time period allowed.
            The option purchaser is entitled to the right to cure a default once in every 12-month period during the period of the covered lease agreement.

     § 47G-6. Effect of seller's default on loan secured by mortgage or lien on property.

        </h3>
        <p>
            If, at any time prior to the expiration of the time period in which the option purchaser has a right to exercise the option to purchase, a default occurs on a loan secured by a mortgage, security interest, or other lien on the property, the option purchaser
            may elect to exercise the option or cancel and rescind the contract and, in addition to any other remedies available at law or equity, seek the immediate return of all moneys paid by the option purchaser. If the purchaser elects to rescind
            the contract, the seller is entitled to an offset of an amount equal to the fair rental value of the use of the property during the duration of the purchaser's possession of the property plus an amount necessary to compensate the seller for
            any damages caused to the property by the purchaser beyond normal wear and tear.

                An option purchaser may bring an action for the recovery of damages, to void a transaction executed in violation of this Chapter, as well as for declaratory or equitable relief for a violation of this Chapter. The rights and remedies provided herein are
                cumulative to, and not a limitation of, any other rights and remedies provided by law or equity. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to subject an individual homeowner selling his or her primary residence directly to an option purchaser
                to liability under G.S. 75-1.1.

                In the event of default by the option purchaser under the terms of the lease agreement, the option seller may initiate a summary ejectment action to recover damages and possession of the leased premises pursuant to Article 3 of Chapter 42 of the General
                Statutes. The magistrate shall retain jurisdiction over the summary ejectment proceeding.

            <li id="t47Gs47G-7ol1c">
                The option purchaser may counterclaim for damages in any summary ejectment proceeding. In accordance with G.S. 7A-219 of the General Statutes, no counterclaim which would make the amount in controversy exceed the jurisdictional limits shall be permitted.
                If a counterclaim in a summary ejectment proceeding is barred pursuant to G.S. 7A-219, the option purchaser shall not be estopped from asserting that claim in a separate action.
