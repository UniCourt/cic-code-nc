        <p>
            Notwithstanding <cite class="octn"><a href="#t38Bs38B-2" target="_self">G.S. 38B-2</a></cite>, a possessor of land may be subject to liability for physical injury or death to a trespasser in the following situations:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li id="t38Bs38B-3ol11">
                Intentional harms. A possessor may be subject to liability if the trespasser's bodily injury or death resulted from the possessor's willful or wanton conduct, or was intentionally caused by the possessor, except that a possessor may use reasonable force
                to repel a trespasser who has entered the land or a building with the intent to commit a crime.
            </li>
            <li id="t38Bs38B-3ol12">
                Harms to trespassing children caused by artificial condition. A possessor may be subject to liability for bodily injury or death to a child trespasser resulting from an artificial condition on the land if all of the following apply:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li id="t38Bs38B-3ol12a">
                        The possessor knew or had reason to know that children were likely to trespass at the location of the condition.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t38Bs38B-3ol12b">
                        The condition is one the possessor knew or reasonably should have known involved an unreasonable risk of serious bodily injury or death to such children.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t38Bs38B-3ol12c">
                        The injured child did not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in the condition or in coming within the area made dangerous by it.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t38Bs38B-3ol12d">
                        The utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger were slight as compared with the risk to the child involved.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t38Bs38B-3ol12e">
                        The possessor failed to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise protect the injured child.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li id="t38Bs38B-3ol13">
                Position of peril. A possessor may be subject to liability for physical injury or death to a trespasser if the possessor discovered the trespasser in a position of peril or helplessness on the property and failed to exercise ordinary care not to injure
                the trespasser.
