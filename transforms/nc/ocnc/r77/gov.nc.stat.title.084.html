       Nonresident Attorneys.

       What Constitutes Practicing Law.
   
   - To constitute the practice of law, within the prohibition of this section, it is necessary that the person charged with its violation shall have customarily or habitually held himself out to the public as a lawyer, or that he has demanded compensation for his services as such. State v. Bryan, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 644</cite>, 4 S.E. 522 (1887).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a person on one occasion acted as an attorney for a party to an action is some evidence for the jury to consider, but is not conclusive of the question. State v. Bryan, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 644</cite>, 4 S.E. 522 (1887). See <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a01s84-4" target="_self">G.S. 84-4</a></cite>.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Section Not Exhaustive.
   
   - The last sentence in this section makes it clear that the statute does encompass all the activities that could be considered the practice of law. Toms v. Lawyers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 408 S.E.2d 206 (1991), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 618</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 95 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Practice of law embraces the preparation of legal documents
   
   and contracts by which legal rights are secured. State v. Pledger, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 634</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 337 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>

       Law Firm's Liability for Activities of Partner.
   
   - In order to determine whether members of a law firm should be held liable for the activities of one of its partners, the court should consider (1) the provisions of the instrument empowering the firm to practice law, such as partnership agreements and articles of incorporation, as well as statutory provisions; (2) the construction which our courts have historically given the questioned activity or related ones; (3) where the partner has acted, or seemed to act, with the firm's authority; this includes his position in the firm, the participation - if any - by the rest of the firm in the disputed activities, and any assurances given the client that this transaction would be handled through the firm; and finally, (4) whether the other members of the firm have assented to or ratified the acts.

       Although corporations were not required to be represented by attorneys in hearings before the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba03s150B-23" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-23</a></cite> (referring to "attorney or representative" of a party), the DMV was exempted from the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act authorizing contested cases to be brought in the OAH, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba01s150B-1ol1e8" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-1(e)(8)</a></cite>, and therefore, in a hearing before the DMV, a corporation was required to be represented by an attorney.

      </p>
      <p>
       Court of Appeals erred in affirming an order by trial court finding that a corporation engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by appearing through a corporate officer before the Department of Motor Vehicles because an administrative agency was not an "action or proceeding" and, thus, a nonattorney could appear or proceed on behalf of a corporation before an administrative hearing officer without engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.

       Preparation of Documents by Employees of Corporations.
   
   - A person who, in the course of his employment by a corporation, prepares a legal document in connection with a business transaction in which the corporation has a primary interest, the corporation being authorized by law and its charter to transact such business, does not violate the statute, for his act in so doing is the act of the corporation in the furtherance of its own business.

       Work Performed by Law Firm's Non-Attorney Staff Employees.
   
   - Censure was an appropriate discipline for an experienced attorney's conduct because the attorney did not exercise the proper supervisory authority sufficient to ensure that the work of a law firms' non-attorney staff employees with regards to a real estate closing was compatible with the attorney's professional obligations as the closing attorney.

Prof. Conduct 3.7 literally supported disqualification, as the case did not involve the attorneys' ability to represent the attorneys but to represent the firm in a suit against a third party while serving as witnesses for the firm as to disputed fact issues, and (3) the North Carolina Court of Appeals had no authority to create an exception to the Rule.

       When Court's Discretionary Power Invoked.
   
   - Unless and until an application under this section meets the requirements of the statute, the court's discretionary power is not invoked. Holley v. Burroughs Wellcome Co., <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 289 S.E.2d 393 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Proper Care Requires Employment of Licensed Counsel.
   
   - To exercise proper care a party must not only pay proper attention to the case himself, he must employ counsel who is licensed or entitled to practice in the court where the case is pending. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Virginia Carolina Bldrs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 628, 292 S.E.2d 135, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 563</cite>, 299 S.E.2d 629 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Local Custom Does Not Abrogate Section.
   
   - The fact that a custom may have grown up among Virginia attorneys practicing near the North Carolina state line to ignore the requirements of this section in no way abrogates or excuses out-of-state counsel from complying with this section. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Virginia Carolina Bldrs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 628, 292 S.E.2d 135, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 563</cite>, 299 S.E.2d 629 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Party cannot nullify this section merely by responding to actions of noncomplying out-of-state attorney
   
   in the courts of this State. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Virginia Carolina Bldrs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 628, 292 S.E.2d 135, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 563</cite>, 299 S.E.2d 629 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Right to Representation by Counsel Not Licensed in State.
   
   - Parties do not have a right to be represented in the courts of this State by counsel who are not duly licensed to practice in this State. Leonard v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 291 S.E.2d 828, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 558</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 371 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court found it necessary to strike the second child and wife's brief, as well as their motions to dismiss and for sanctions; their counsel, who was apparently admitted to practice in Florida, was not licensed to practice in North Carolina, counsel failed to comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a01s84-4.1" target="_self">G.S. 84-4.1</a></cite>, and no other counsel appeared on their behalf. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 638 S.E.2d 601, appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 427</cite>, 648 S.E.2d 502 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An out-of-state attorney has no absolute right to practice law in another forum.
   
   It is permissive and subject to the sound discretion of the court. State v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 556</cite>, 227 S.E.2d 535 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1093, 97 S. Ct. 1106, 51 L. Ed. 2d 539 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Prohibition of Habitual Practice in Courts of State by Nonresident Counsel.
   
   - This section forbids the courts from allowing nonresident counsel, when citizens of other states and not holding license from the North Carolina Supreme Court, from practicing habitually in our courts, and they cannot acquire the right to do so. State v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 556</cite>, 227 S.E.2d 535 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1093, 97 S. Ct. 1106, 51 L. Ed. 2d 539 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Partial Compliance with Section.
   
   - In a criminal prosecution the trial court did not err in permitting the defendant's retained counsel from Alabama to appear before the court in his behalf without complying strictly with the provisions of this section for two reasons. First, the defendant was allowed to have those counsel whom he wanted to defend him. They were retained by him and allowed to practice in the North Carolina courts on his motion. At no time during the proceedings did he express concern regarding their competency, and any such objection was waived. Secondly, the statute was not designed for his protection, and did not vest in him any rights to counsel other than what he would ordinarily possess in the absence of the statute. State v. Scarboro, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 105, 247 S.E.2d 273, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 652</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 256 (1978); 440 U.S. 938, 99 S. Ct. 1286, 59 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conditional Application for Admission for Limited Purpose.
   
   - This section does not permit an out-of-state attorney to move for admission for a limited purpose in this State on a conditional basis. The requirement of subdivision (3) of this section calls for a firm commitment from the movant which is contrary in spirit to a conditional application for admission for a limited purpose. In re Smith, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 123, 263 S.E.2d 23 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 621</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 834 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficiency of Declaration Under Subdivision (1).
   
   - A declaration by an applicant that he is a member in good standing of the Bar of another state and is duly licensed and admitted to practice in that state is sufficient to meet the requirements of subdivision (1) of this section. Holley v. Burroughs Wellcome Co., <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 289 S.E.2d 393 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement of North Carolina Counsel Insufficient Under Subdivision (2).
   
   - The requirement under subdivision (2) of this section cannot be met by substituting the statement of North Carolina counsel and the statement must be signed by the client. Holley v. Burroughs Wellcome Co., <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 289 S.E.2d 393 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Association with Local Attorney.
   
   - Subdivision (5) of this section allows courts to control out-of-state counsel and assure compliance with the duties and responsibilities of an attorney practicing in the courts of this State, and the association of out-of-state counsel with a local attorney satisfies a reasonable interest of the courts in having a member of the Bar of this State responsible for the litigation; thus, this statute is specifically designed to insure that the court has ready jurisdiction over those appearing only occasionally before it by insuring that counsel who appear regularly before it participate in the case. In re Smith, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 621</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 834 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Same - Requirement May Not Be Waived.
   
   - A trial judge cannot waive the requirement of subdivision (5) of this section which states that local counsel be associated before an out-of-state attorney is admitted to limited practice in the courts of this State because unless and until subdivisions (1) through (5) are complied with, the court has no discretion whatever. In re Smith, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 621</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 834 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Same - Ineligible Attorney May Not Be Held In Contempt.
   
   - An out-of-state attorney could not be held in and punished for willful contempt of court for failure to comply with an order of the trial court that he appear as an attorney in a criminal case where there had been no general appearance by local counsel as required by this section and the out-of-state attorney thus never acquired eligibility to appear in the case and was never an attorney in the case admitted to limited practice in North Carolina. In re Smith, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 621</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 834 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Withdrawal of Out-of-State Counsel Controlled.
   
   - It does not seem equitable to allow adequately compensated trial counsel to withdraw after they have exhausted defendant's resources and to cast the burden of court appointment upon new counsel. Conduct in this regard by out-of-state counsel is controllable under subdivision (3) of this section as an initial condition upon which he is allowed to appear for trial. State v. Nickerson, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 185 S.E.2d 326 (1971), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 304</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 179; 408 U.S. 925, 92 S. Ct. 2503, 33 L. Ed. 2d 336 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial Right to Representation by Attorney Properly Admitted Under Section.
   
   - Plaintiff had a substantial right to have attorney of her choice, who had been
   properly admitted pro hac vice under this section represent her in her lawsuit, and order removing him as counsel affected a substantial right of the plaintiff and was immediately appealable. Goldston v. AMC, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 723</cite>, 392 S.E.2d 735 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judge's order removing counsel who was admitted pro hac vice affected a substantial right of plaintiffs and was immediately appealable. Smith v. Beaufort County Hosp. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 203, 540 S.E.2d 775 (2000), cert denied, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 381</cite>, 547 S.E.2d 435 (2001), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 212</cite>, 552 S.E.2d 139 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of Motion for Admission Pro Hac Vice Is Interlocutory.
   
   - Order denying plaintiff's motion to reconsider order denying attorney's motion for admission pro hac vice is an interlocutory order and is not immediately appealable; it does not come within the statutory appeals in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIXa27s1-277ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1-277(a)</a></cite> or 7A-27(d). Leonard v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 291 S.E.2d 828, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 558</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 371 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Prejudicial error not found
   
   where the reviewing court was unable to determine from the record whether local counsel appeared with the out-of-state counsel and there was no record of objection from petitioners. In re Bean, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 363, 511 S.E.2d 683 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro Hac Vice Status Properly Revoked.
   
   - Attorney's pro hac vice status was properly revoked because (1) the attorney did not disclose the attorney's prior discipline, and (2) such disclosure was mandatory. Ge Betz, Inc. v. Conrad, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 752 S.E.2d 634 (2013).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary Revocation of Grant of Admission Allowed.
   
   - The express language of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a01s84-4.2" target="_self">G.S. 84-4.2</a></cite> allows a superior court judge the authority and discretion to summarily revoke an earlier order granting pro hac vice admission pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a01s84-4.1" target="_self">G.S. 84-4.1</a></cite>. Smith v. Beaufort County Hosp. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Revocation of Pro Hac Vice Status Unwarranted.
   
   - Conduct of plaintiff's counsel in Kentucky had been found not to violate Kentucky Rules of Professional Conduct, and N.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct 8.5 could not be used to revoke counsel's pro hac vice status under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a01s84-4.1" target="_self">G.S. 84-4.1</a></cite>; a finding that counsel violated N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 4.3 was improper under Revised Rule 8.5, and was a misapprehension of law that was material and changed the outcome. Sisk v. Transylvania Cmty. Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C.

       It shall be unlawful for any corporation to practice law or appear as an attorney for any person in any court in this State, or before any judicial body or the North Carolina Industrial Commission, Utilities Commission, or the Department of Commerce, Division of Employment Security, or hold itself out to the public or advertise as being entitled to practice law; and no corporation shall organize corporations, or draw agreements, or other legal documents, or draw wills, or practice law, or give legal advice, or hold itself out in any manner as being entitled to do any of the foregoing acts, by or through any person orally or by advertisement, letter or circular. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other provisions of Chapter 84. Provided, that nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a banking corporation authorized and licensed to act in a fiduciary capacity from performing any clerical, accounting, financial or business acts required of it in the performance of its duties as a fiduciary or from performing ministerial and clerical acts in the preparation and filing of such tax returns as are so required, or from discussing the business and financial aspects of fiduciary relationships.

       - State prosecutors were properly granted summary judgment in action to enjoin enforcement of North Carolina's unauthorized practice of law statutes because statutes did not unconstitutionally restrict trade association's associational rights, statutes survived intermediate scrutiny and did not unlawfully burden association's freedom of speech as state had established reasonable fit between statutes and substantial government interest in regulating legal profession to protect clients, statutes did not deny association due process as there was rational basis to restrict corporate ownership of professional businesses to protect consumers, statutes were not vague, and statutes did not violate state constitution's Monopoly Clause.

      <p>
       Sufficiency of Writing.
   
   - The power of attorney which a lawyer may be required to file, pursuant to this section, is some writing addressed to him by the client or an agent for the client. Therefore, letters written by the client to third persons expressing gratification because of the employment of a particular attorney will not suffice to supply the want of power. Day v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 254</cite> (1869).
      </p>
      <p>
       A power of attorney, signed by the purchaser of a note, in the name of the payee, is sufficient authority under this section for an attorney-at-law to appear in a cause in court, although the agent has no written authority to make the power. Johnson ex rel. Adams v. Sikes, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. 70</cite> (1856).
   <br />

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right to Question Authority of Attorney.
   
   - While an attorney who claims to enter an appearance for any party to an action may be required to produce and file a power or authority as provided in this section, once an attorney has entered an appearance and has been recognized by the court as an attorney in the cause, the opposite party may not call in question his authority. Henderson v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 1</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 227 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Time of Demand for Authority.
   
   - The defendant has the right, because of this section to demand the authority at the return term of a summons. Reece v. Reece, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 377</cite> (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the demand for the power of attorney is made at the return term, it is the practice and within the discretion of the judge to extend the time; if, however, such demand is not made at the proper time, and before the right to appear has been recognized, it comes too late, unless there are peculiar circumstances tending to excuse the party for not making it in apt time. Reece v. Reece, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 377</cite> (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       After an attorney has entered an appearance and has been recognized by the court as attorney in the cause, no written authority can be required of him at a subsequent time. This means that the opposite party shall not call in question his authority, unless he does so within the time and in accordance with the provision of this section. Day v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 254</cite> (1869); City of New Bern v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 606</cite> (1869).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Client Present.
   
   - If a written authority is required under this section the attorney must produce the same, even if his client is present at the bar of the court. Day v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 254</cite> (1869).
   <br />

       Special Appearance for Nonresident.
   
   - Upon special appearance of the attorneys of a husband who was a nonresident and a fugitive from justice, and whose property had been attached by his wife, for the purpose of moving to dismiss the action, the court should, on motion made, have required them to file their written authority under this section.

       The elements of fraud are:
   
   (1) False representation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to deceive, (3) made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting in damage to the injured party. Jordan v. Crew, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 712, 482 S.E.2d 735, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 279</cite>, 487 S.E.2d 548 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Constructive Fraud.
   
   - Constructive fraud differs from actual fraud in that the intent to deceive is not an essential element. Jordan v. Crew, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 712, 482 S.E.2d 735, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 279</cite>, 487 S.E.2d 548 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Constructive Fraud Shown.
   
   - Trustee had a fiduciary relationship to plaintiffs and in the performance of his obligation to file annual accountings defendant trustee did not act openly, fairly, and honestly, which was tantamount to constructive fraud; thus, the trial court did not err in awarding double damages. Estate of Smith ex rel. Smith v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 487 S.E.2d 807, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 398</cite>, 494 S.E.2d 410 (1997).

      </p>
      <p>
       Section Not Limited to Actual Fraud Cases.
   
   - This section does not limit its applicability to cases of actual fraud. Booher v. Frue, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 394 S.E.2d 816 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens Prevented from Practicing.
   
   - No one should be presented to the public under the panoply of such a license (to practice law), against whom an injured suitor would not have the full benefit of such remedy as the laws of the State provide, in the event of fraudulent or negligent practice. An alien could not be admitted to practice, as actions under this section would be removable to the United States courts. Ex parte Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. 355</cite> (1824).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption of Fraud.
   
   - The relation of attorney and client is one of a fiduciary character, and gives rise to a presumption of fraud when the former, in dealing with the latter, obtains an advantage. Egerton v. Logan, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. 172</cite> (1879).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Fraud Not Found.
   
   - Any damages sustained by plaintiffs due to problems with trademarks they thought they were acquiring did not proximately result from any acts or omissions of defendants attorneys, where two corporate officers of plaintiffs companies were informed before the acquisition by a vice-president of defendant company that the trademarks, which were very similar to and thus conflicted with the marks of another company, were not federally registered and that applications for their registration had been rejected; the knowledge of the president or agent of a corporation is imputed to the corporation itself. Jay Group, Ltd. v. Glasgow, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 595, 534 S.E.2d 233 (2000), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 265</cite>, 546 S.E.2d 100 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an attorney mishandles client funds, there is a presumption of fraud as a matter of law, and this section applies. Ehlenbeck v. Patton, 58 Bankr. 149 (W.D.N.C. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In consumers' putative class suit against companies and individuals that operated a debt elimination and credit repair scheme that allegedly engaged in fraud, the consumers' derivative damages claim failed because the consumers failed to state a viable claim for fraud or conspiracy to commit any fraud or fraudulent practice. Taylor v. Bettis, 976 F. Supp. 2d 721 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 30, 2013), aff'd, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 12626 (4th Cir. N.C. 2017).

        In a bankruptcy proceeding in which client of bankrupt attorney filed a proof of claim
       </b>
       relating to attorney's embezzlement of money delivered to him in trust, the bankruptcy judge did not err in finding client's actual damages, then doubling the damages pursuant to this section, and finding the entire amount nondischargeable. Ehlenbeck v. Patton, 58 Bankr. 149 (W.D.N.C. 1986).

       Bankruptcy Trustee Standing.
   
   - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a02s84-13" target="_self">G.S. 84-13</a></cite> makes an attorney who commits any fraudulent practice liable for double damages to the party injured. One can safely assume that this would include a client corporation as well as its creditors; thus, as the debtor's legal successor, the bankruptcy trustee would have standing to sue. Mitchell v. Greenberg (In re Creative Entm't, Inc.), - Bankr. - (Bankr. W.D.N.C. May 27, 2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Independent Basis for Relief.
   
   - As plaintiffs' substantive claims for constructive fraud and duress were dismissed, their causes of action for violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a02s84-13" target="_self">G.S. 84-13</a></cite>, disallowance of claims, liens against property of the estate, and punitive damages were necessarily dismissed as well, as they were actually remedies and did not provide independent bases for relief. Outer Banks Ventures, Inc. v. Tinkham (In re Outer Banks Ventures, Inc.), 556 B.R. 199 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision for double damages applies
   
   only after a factual determination at trial of fraudulent practice by an attorney and, thus, did not apply where plaintiffs accepted defendant's offer of judgment tendered pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 68. Estate of Wells v. Toms, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 500 S.E.2d 105 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Double Damages Awarded.
   
   - Where defendant was successor trustee and administrator of estate the trial court did not err in applying this section and allowing double compensatory damages against defendant. Melvin v. Home Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 660, 482 S.E.2d 6 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 281</cite>, 487 S.E.2d 551 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney breached the attorney's fiduciary duty to the two clients by converting funds, which caused a loss to the two clients. Since the attorney's conversion and breach of fiduciary duty were presumed to be fraudulent, the attorney was shown to have committed a fraudulent practice and the two clients were entitled to an award of compensatory damages and an award of double damages pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a02s84-13" target="_self">G.S. 84-13</a></cite>. N.C. State Bar v. Gilbert, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 320, 663 S.E.2d 1 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 682</cite>, 670 S.E.2d 234 (2008).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Double Damages Not Awarded.
   
   - Defendants were entitled to summary judgment as to plaintiff's claim for statutory damages pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a02s84-13" target="_self">G.S. 84-13</a></cite> arising from legal representation, because without a prima facie showing of actual or constructive fraud or any fraudulent practice, no claim for double damages arose under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a02s84-13" target="_self">G.S. 84-13</a></cite>. Wilkins v. Safran, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 649 S.E.2d 658 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest Improper on Punitive Double Damages.
   
   - Trial court should not have awarded prejudgment interest and post-judgment interest on both the compensatory and the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a02s84-13" target="_self">G.S. 84-13</a></cite> punitive double damage award in the State bar's action against the attorney for reimbursement of funds paid to the two clients after the attorney breached the attorney's fiduciary duty to them and converted their funds. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.024.html#t24a01s24-5ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 24-5(b)</a></cite> only allowed interest to be awarded for compensatory damages. N.C. State Bar v. Gilbert, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 320, 663 S.E.2d 1 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 682</cite>, 670 S.E.2d 234 (2008).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The purpose of the statute creating the North Carolina State Bar
   
   is to enable the Bar to render more effective service in improving the administration of justice, particularly in dealing with the problem of admission to the Bar, and of disciplining and disbarring attorneys-at-law.

       Effect of Proceedings Before State Bar.
   
   - Where the status of plaintiff's license as an attorney was at issue and was finally adjudicated in proceedings before the State Bar and the Bar Council, and plaintiff did not appeal the Bar's order of disbarment, that judgment was conclusive as to those matters which were at issue and determined in those proceedings, and plaintiff could not relitigate the identical issue considered and finally determined in the proceedings before the State Bar.

     <p>
      The membership of the North Carolina State Bar shall consist of two classes, active and inactive.
     </p>
     <p>
      The active members shall be all persons who have obtained a license or certificate, entitling them to practice law in the State of North Carolina, who have paid the membership dues specified, and who have satisfied all other obligations of membership. No person other than a member of the North Carolina State Bar shall practice in any court of the State except foreign attorneys as provided by
   statute and natural persons representing themselves.

      <li id="t84a04s84-16ol11">
       All persons who have obtained a license to practice law in the State but who have been found by the Council to be not engaged in the practice of law and not holding themselves out as practicing attorneys and not occupying any public or private positions in which they may be called upon to give legal advice or counsel or to examine the law or to pass upon, adjudicate, or offer an opinion concerning the legal effect of any act, document, or law.

     </ol>
     <p>
      All active members shall be required to pay annual membership fees, and shall have the right to vote in elections held by the district bar in the judicial district in which the member resides. If a member desires to vote with the bar of some district in which the member practices, other than that in which the member resides, the member may do so by filing with the Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar a statement in writing that the member desires to vote in the other district; provided, however, that in no case shall the member be entitled to vote in more than one district.

       § 84-17. Government.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The government of the North Carolina State Bar is vested in a council of the North Carolina State Bar referred to in this Chapter as the "Council." The Council shall be composed of a variable number of councilors equal to the number of judicial districts plus 16, the officers of the North Carolina State Bar, who shall be councilors during their respective terms of office, and each retiring president of the North Carolina State Bar who shall be a councilor for one year from the date of expiration of his term as president. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the law, the North Carolina State Bar may borrow money and may acquire, hold, rent, encumber, alienate, lease, and otherwise deal with real or personal property in the same manner as any private person or corporation, subject only to the approval of the Governor and the Council of State as to the borrowing of money and the acquisition, rental, encumbering, leasing and sale of real property. The Council shall be competent to exercise the entire powers of the North Carolina State Bar in respect of the interpretation and administration of this Article, the borrowing of money, the acquisition, lease, sale, or mortgage of property, real or personal, the seeking of amendments to this Chapter, and all other matters. There shall be one councilor from each judicial district and 16 additional councilors. The additional councilors shall be allocated and reallocated by the North Carolina State Bar every six years based on the number of active members of each judicial district bar according to the records of the North Carolina State Bar and in accordance with a formula to be adopted by the North Carolina State Bar, to insure an allocation based on lawyer population of each judicial district bar as it relates to the total number of active members of the State Bar.
     </p>
     <p>
      A councilor whose seat has been eliminated due to a reallocation shall continue to serve on the Council until expiration of the remainder of the current term. A councilor whose judicial district is altered by the General Assembly during the councilor's term shall continue to serve on the Council until the expiration of the term and shall represent the district wherein the councilor resides or with which the councilor has elected to be affiliated. If before the alteration of the judicial district of the councilor the judicial district included both the place of residence and the place of practice of the councilor, and if after the alteration of the judicial district the councilor's place of residence and place of practice are located in different districts, the councilor must, not later than 10 days from the effective date of the alteration of the district, notify the Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar of an election to affiliate with and represent either the councilor's district of residence or district of practice.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the councilors, there shall be three public members not licensed to practice law in this or any other state who shall be appointed by the Governor. The public members may vote and participate in all matters before the Council to the same extent as councilors elected or appointed from the various judicial districts.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Setting Aside Judgment of Disbarment.
   
   - The court is without authority to set aside a judgment of disbarment on motion, especially since the enactment of this and subsequent sections. State v. Hollingsworth, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 739</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 99 (1934).

      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction of Disciplinary Hearing Commission.
   
   - Proceedings before the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission to discipline a sitting judge were dismissed because only the North Carolina Supreme Court or the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission had jurisdiction to discipline sitting judges for conduct in office. N.C. State Bar v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 264</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 743 (2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina State Bar Has Jurisdiction over Unethical Conduct of Counsel.
   
   - While the court has the inherent power to act whenever it is made to appear that the conduct of counsel in a cause pending in court is improper or unethical, questions of propriety and ethics are ordinarily for the consideration of the North Carolina State Bar which is now vested with jurisdiction over such matters. McMichael v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 479</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 231 (1956).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Error in Dismissing Grievance Filed with State Bar.
   
   - North Carolina State Bar and the trial courts of this State share concurrent jurisdiction over matters of attorney discipline; therefore, where individual filed a civil claim against attorney for alleged impropriety in handling an estate, and also filed a grievance with the State Bar alleging that the attorney's actions violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, the trial court erred in naming the State Bar as a party and dismissing the grievance proceeding against the defendant. North Carolina State Bar v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 699</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 185 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Confession of Guilt.
   
   - Where an attorney has confessed in open court to four crimes, all involving moral turpitude, and he has been disbarred from practicing in the district court of the United States, disbarment must ultimately result regardless of this and the following sections. In re Brittain, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 95</cite>, 197 S.E. 705 (1938).
   <br />

      <p>
       North Carolina Court of Appeals Lacked Authority to Create Exception to Professional Conduct Rule.
   
   - It was not an abuse of discretion to disqualify a law firm's attorneys from representing the firm in a fee collection case because (1) the attorneys would be necessary trial witnesses, the attorneys' testimony would encompass material, disputed issues, and none of N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 3.7's exceptions applied, (2) N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 3.7 literally supported disqualification, as the case did not involve the attorneys' ability to represent the attorneys but to represent the firm in a suit against a third party while serving as witnesses for the firm as to disputed fact issues, and (3) the North Carolina Court of Appeals had no authority to create an exception to the Rule.

       Constitutionality.
   
   - The "character and general fitness" requirement of this section and the "good moral character" requirement of the Rules Governing Admission to the Practice of Law are constitutionally permissible standards. In re Willis, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 1</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 771, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 976, 96 S. Ct. 389, 46 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a state cannot exclude a person from the practice of law for reasons that contravene the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, a state can require high standards for admission to the bar, including good moral character and proficiency in its laws, so long as the qualifying standards have a rational connection with the applicant's fitness or capacity to practice law. In re Willis, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 1</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 771, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 976, 96 S. Ct. 389, 46 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "good moral character," although broad, has been so extensively used as a standard that its long usage and the case law surrounding that usage have given the term well-defined contours which make it a constitutionally appropriate standard. In re Willis, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 1</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 771, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 976, 96 S. Ct. 389, 46 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power by authorizing the Board of Law Examiners to make rules governing admission to the bar to "promote the welfare of the State and the profession." Bring v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 655</cite>, 501 S.E.2d 907 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutional power to establish the qualifications for admission to the bar rests in the legislature,
   
   which may delegate a limited portion of its power as to some specific subject matter if it prescribes the standards under which the agency is to exercise the delegated authority. Bowens v. Board of Law Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 291 S.E.2d 170 (1982).

       Board Able to Establish Guidelines.

       This section establishes the Board of Law Examiners as an administrative agency of the State, and its findings of fact are conclusive on appeal if properly supported by the evidence.

        Rule-Making Power Delegated.
       </b>
       - The North Carolina General Assembly, in this section, has delegated its rule-making power to the Board of Law Examiners and has determined that the Board shall also apply its own rules "to the particular case." Keenan v. Board of Law Exmrs., 317 F. Supp. 1350 (E.D.N.C. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       In licensing those who desire to engage in professions or occupations such as may be proper subjects of such regulation, the legislature may confer upon executive officers or bodies the power of granting or refusing to license persons to enter such trades or professions only when it has prescribed a sufficient standard for their guidance. In re Willis, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 1</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 771, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 976, 96 S. Ct. 389, 46 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Legislature is not equipped to investigate law schools with graduates applying for admission to the bar to determine whether the schools meet the minimum requirement; thus, this ministerial task has properly been delegated to the Board of Law Examiners. Bring v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 486 S.E.2d 236 (1997), appeal denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 135</cite>, 492 S.E.2d 18 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 655</cite>, 501 S.E.2d 907 (1998).

      <p>
       A person does not have a natural or constitutional right to practice law;
   
   it is a privilege or franchise to be earned by hard study and compliance with the qualifications for admission to practice law prescribed by law. By virtue of its police power a state is authorized to establish qualifications for admission to practice law in its jurisdiction. Baker v. Varser, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 260</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 90 (1954).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The determination of proficiency is a ministerial function,
   
   not a matter of managing public affairs. The Board of Law Examiners is, therefore, not required to make important policy choices which might just as easily be made by the elected representatives in the legislature, but merely to compile and administer examinations. Form, grading and logistics only are left to the board, which does no violence to constitutional principle. Bowens v. Board of Law Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 291 S.E.2d 170 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of Board.
   
   - The Board of Law Examiners was created for the purpose of examining applicants and providing rules and regulations for admission to the bar. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 634</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 826 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not arbitrary to limit permission to take the bar examination to a certain group of persons
   
   if the limitation is reasonably related to a legitimate objective, such as fitness to practice law. Bring v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 486 S.E.2d 236 (1997), appeal denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 135</cite>, 492 S.E.2d 18 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 655</cite>, 501 S.E.2d 907 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigation of Individual Schools' Qualifications Unreasonable.
   
   - Requiring the Board of Law Examiners to investigate the individual qualifications of every nonaccredited law school each time a graduate from a nonaccredited law school applies for admission to the state's bar would place an unreasonable burden on the Board. Bring v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 486 S.E.2d 236 (1997), appeal denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 135</cite>, 492 S.E.2d 18 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 655</cite>, 501 S.E.2d 907 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The policy requiring that applicants for admission to the North Carolina bar graduate from an ABA approved law school is a reasonable means of assuring
   
   that applicants have a competent legal education and facilitates the legislative goal of protection of the public interest by the maintenance of a competent Bar. Bring v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 486 S.E.2d 236 (1997), appeal denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 135</cite>, 492 S.E.2d 18 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 655</cite>, 501 S.E.2d 907 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Character Evaluation and Examination Are Separate and Distinct Requirements.
   
   - In an action to obtain admission to the North Carolina Bar, it was found that the Board of Law Examiners properly advised the applicant for admission to the practice of law that he would be permitted to take the bar examination but that the result would be sealed until the board has concluded its character evaluation, and the board was not required subsequently to divulge applicant's examination result, since the result was irrelevant to the matter of applicant's character evaluation, and even if applicant failed the examination, this appeal would not be moot since it concerned applicant's character, a separate and distinct matter. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 634</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 826 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicant Has Burden of Showing Compliance with Residence Requirement.
   
   - The burden of showing that he has the qualifications to comply with requirements of Rule Five of the Rules Governing Admission to Practice of Law in North Carolina, adopted under authority of this Article, and specifying the resident requirement, rests upon the applicant, and if the proof offered by him fails to satisfy the Board of Law Examiners that he has the qualifications required by the rule, it is their duty to deny his application to take the examination for admission. Baker v. Varser, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 260</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 90 (1954).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The findings of fact made by the Board of Law Examiners supported by the evidence are conclusive
   
   upon a reviewing court, and are not within the scope of reviewing powers. Baker v. Varser, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 260</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 90 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as there is evidence in the record which rationally justifies a finding that the applicant has failed to establish his moral fitness to practice law, this court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the Board of Law Examiners. In re Willis, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 1</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 771, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 976, 96 S. Ct. 389, 46 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Board's Duty to Resolve Factual Disputes.
   
   - When a decision of the Board of Law Examiners rests on a specific fact or facts the existence of which is contested, the board's duty to resolve the factual dispute by specific findings is no less than that of other administrative agencies. In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section the board is the primary investigatory and fact-finding agency in the bar admissions process. When factual disputes are fairly brought before it, it must resolve them. No other agency exists to make such resolutions. In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining an applicant's fitness to practice law, the Board of Law Examiners should not conduct a hearing to consider applicant's alleged commission of specific acts of misconduct and, without a finding that he committed the prior acts, use his denial that he committed them as substantive evidence of his lack of moral character; rather, the board should first determine whether in fact the applicant committed the prior acts of misconduct and, if it determines that he did, it must then say whether these acts so reflect on the applicant's character that they are sufficient to rebut his prima facie showing of good character. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 634</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 826 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the board is free "to make or cause to be made such examinations and investigations as may be deemed necessary," it was not improper for the board to question the witness before the 1987 hearing in the course of its investigation without first notifying applicant, and furthermore, the witness's adverse testimony at the hearing regarding the events surrounding the loan did not constitute a protest. In re Legg, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 628</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 353 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Detailing of Facts on Which Conclusion Is Based.
   
   - In cases in which all the essential facts either appear on the face of the application or are otherwise indisputably established, the board need only weigh the evidence and determine whether the applicant has shown his good moral character. However, even in such cases, while it might be permissible for the board not to make specific findings of fact, a detailing of the facts on which it bases its conclusions would facilitate judicial review. In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the only facts which could support a conclusion that the applicant did not show good moral character are in sharp dispute, the board must necessarily serve as the adjudicator of the facts in dispute and must ultimately find with regard to them what it believes the truth to be. Mere recitation of the testimony heard by the board will not suffice. Administrative agencies must find facts when factual issues are presented. They cannot fulfill this duty by merely summarizing the evidence. In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden of Proving Specific Acts of Misconduct.
   
   - When an applicant makes a prima facie showing of his good moral character and, to rebut the showing, the board relies on specific acts of misconduct the commission of which is denied by the applicant, the board must assume the burden of proving the specific acts by the greater weight of the evidence. The rule that applicant has the overall burden to prove his good moral character does not relieve the board from having to prove such specific acts of misconduct. In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       To place the burden on the applicant to disprove acts of misconduct would be a distortion of the intended effect of the rule requiring the applicant to prove, overall, his good character. In order to avoid this distortion it is necessary to distinguish between applicant's overall burden of showing good moral character and the board's burden of proving particular instances of misconduct. In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an applicant makes a prima facie showing of good moral character and the board, to rebut the showing, relies on specific acts of misconduct the commission of which are denied by the applicant, the board must prove the specific acts by the greater weight of the evidence. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 634</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 826 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action to obtain admission to the North Carolina Bar, it was found that a finding of fact by the Board of Law Examiners that applicant "made false statements under oath on matters material to his fitness of character" inadequately resolved the factual issue which it addressed and was too vague to permit appropriate judicial review because the board did not indicate which statements it considered to be untruthful; consequently, neither a reviewing court nor the applicant could be certain as to the content or materiality of the false statements referred to, and the board could not meet its burden of proving specific acts of misconduct without setting out with specificity what they were and that they had been proved by the greater weight of the evidence. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 634</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 826 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicant's Showing of Good Moral Character.
   
   - An applicant for admission to the bar has the burden of showing his good moral character. At the outset, he must come forward with sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case. The board, or any other person wishing to contest an application, may then offer rebuttal evidence. If there are material factual disputes, the board must resolve them by making findings of fact. If the disputes arise out of charges initially made before the board, the board must determine whether the charges have been proved by a preponderance of the evidence before it can rely on them in concluding that an applicant has not shown his good moral character. In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Good moral character is something more than the absence of bad character. It is the good name which the applicant has acquired, or should have acquired, through association with his fellows. It means that he must have conducted himself as a man of upright character ordinarily would, should or does. Such character expresses itself, not in negatives nor in following the line of least resistance, but quite often in the will to do the unpleasant thing, if it is right, and the resolve not to do the pleasant thing, if it is wrong. In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Character encompasses both a person's past behavior and the opinion of members of his community arising from it. In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a person is of good moral character is seldom subject to proof by reference to one or two incidents.
   
   In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An application for admission to the bar may not be denied on the basis of suspicions or accusations alone.
   
   In re Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 48</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 912 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficiency of Findings.
   
   - Where an applicant for admission to the practice of law had been convicted of assault and murder, finding by the Board of Law Examiners that applicant did not disclose that he had been convicted of assault and battery on a female failed adequately to resolve the factual issue to which it was addressed where the factual issue before the board was whether the omission was a mere inadvertence caused by applicant's initial failure to recall the conviction as an incident separate from the murder or was instead a purposeful omission designed to mislead the board, the later correction of which was prompted only by notice of the hearing. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 634</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 826 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action to obtain admission to the North Carolina Bar, the court on appeal could not conclude that as a matter of law the Board of Law Examiners' evidence was insufficient to support findings of fact which could rebut a prima facie showing of good moral character by an applicant for admission to the bar where it was undisputed that applicant had committed and been convicted of murder and assault; the question before the board was whether these acts occurring 14 years ago continued to constitute evidence that applicant was presently morally unfit to practice law; and only the board through proper findings of fact and conclusions of law based thereon could answer the question as to whether events subsequent to the murder and assault demonstrated to the board that applicant had been fully rehabilitated so that the evidentiary force of the 14 year old offenses was spent or whether they led to a contrary conclusion. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 634</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 826 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings Not Prejudicial.
   
   - An applicant for admission to practice law was not prejudiced where the Board of Law Examiners found that applicant was paroled after serving a portion of his prison term but the board failed to find that applicant was completely discharged from parole, since the reviewing court would take into account, under a whole record review, undisputed facts which favored applicant's position including the fact of discharge from parole which applicant argued was unfairly omitted from the board's findings. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 634</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 826 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The "whole record" test is the proper scope of judicial review of findings of the Board of Law Examiners.

       Any attorney admitted to practice law in this State, who is convicted of or has tendered and has had accepted, a plea of guilty or no contest to, a criminal offense showing professional unfitness, may be disciplined based upon the conviction, without awaiting the outcome of any appeals of the conviction. An order of discipline based solely upon a conviction of a criminal offense showing professional unfitness shall be vacated immediately upon receipt by the Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar of a certified copy of a judgment or order reversing the conviction. The fact that the attorney's criminal conviction has been overturned on appeal shall not prevent the North Carolina State Bar from conducting a disciplinary proceeding against the attorney based upon the same underlying facts or events that were the subject of the criminal proceeding.
      </li>
      <li id="t84a04s84-28ol1-d1">
       An attorney who is disciplined as provided in subsection (d) of this section may petition the court in the trial division in the judicial district where the conviction occurred for an order staying the disciplinary action pending the outcome of any appeals of the conviction. The court may grant or deny the stay in its discretion upon such terms as it deems proper. A stay of the disciplinary action by the court shall not prevent the North Carolina State Bar from going forward with a disciplinary proceeding against the attorney based upon the same underlying facts or events that were the subject of the criminal proceeding.
      </li>
      <li id="t84a04s84-28ol1e">
       Any attorney admitted to practice law in this State who is disciplined in another jurisdiction shall be subject to the same discipline in this State: Provided, that the discipline imposed in the other jurisdiction does not exceed that provided for in subsection (c) above and that the attorney was not deprived of due process in the other jurisdiction.
      </li>
      <li id="t84a04s84-28ol1f">
       Upon application by the North Carolina State Bar, misconduct by an attorney admitted to practice in this State may be restrained or enjoined where the necessity for prompt action exists regardless of whether a disciplinary proceeding in the matter of the conduct is pending. The application shall be filed in the Superior Court of Wake County and shall be governed by the procedure set forth in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 65.
      </li>
      <li id="t84a04s84-28ol1g">
       Any member of the North Carolina State Bar may be transferred to disability inactive status for mental incompetence, physical disability, or substance abuse interfering with the attorney's ability to competently engage in the practice of law under the rules and procedures the Council adopts pursuant to G.S. 84-23.
      </li>
      <li id="t84a04s84-28ol1h">
       There shall be an appeal of right by either party from any final order of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission to the North Carolina Court of Appeals. Review by the appellate division shall be upon matters of law or legal inference. The procedures governing any appeal shall be as provided by statute or court rule for appeals in civil cases. A final order which imposes disbarment or suspension for 18 months or more shall not be stayed except upon application, under the rules of the Court of Appeals, for a writ of supersedeas. A final order imposing suspension for less than 18 months or any other discipline except disbarment shall be stayed pending determination of any appeal of right.
      </li>
      <li id="t84a04s84-28ol1i">
       The North Carolina State Bar may invoke the process of the General Court of Justice to enforce the powers of the Council or any committee to which the Council delegates its authority.

       The North Carolina State Bar may apply to appropriate courts for orders necessary to protect the interests of clients of missing, suspended, disbarred, disabled, or deceased attorneys.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Any order disbarring or suspending an attorney may impose reasonable conditions precedent to reinstatement. No attorney who has been disbarred by the Disciplinary Hearing Commission, the Council, or by order of any court of this State may seek reinstatement to the practice of law prior to five years from the effective date of the order of disbarment. Any order of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission or the Grievance Committee imposing an admonition, reprimand, censure, or stayed suspension may also require the attorney to complete a reasonable amount of continuing legal education in addition to the minimum amount required by the North Carolina Supreme Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      The senior regular resident judge of the superior court of any district wherein a member of the North Carolina State Bar resides or maintains an office shall have the authority and power to enter orders necessary to protect the interests of the clients, including the authority to order the payment of compensation by the member or the estate of a deceased or disabled member to any attorney appointed to administer or conserve the law practice of the member. Compensation awarded to a member serving under this section awarded from the estate of a deceased member shall be considered an administrative expense of the estate for purposes of determining priority of payment.

          Many of the cases cited under this section were decided under former statutes similar in subject matter to the present section.
         </b>
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutionality.
   
   - Laws 1870-1, c. 216, s. 4, an early statute dealing with the same subject matter as this section, was constitutional. It did not take away any of the inherent rights which are absolutely essential in the administration of justice. Ex parte Schenck, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 353</cite> (1871).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction with Fifth Amendment Rights.
   
   - The requirements of this section did not cause the defendant to be compelled, in violation of his constitutional rights, by the State bar to provide information which would later be used against him in a perjury case where he, acting of his own volition, made statements to the bar investigator. The record does not indicate that these statements were extracted under the power of a subpoena; and the defendant was not in custody at the time these statements were made. The defendant could have asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege during the bar proceedings, although the protection would not have extended to any records that he was required by law to maintain. State v. Linney, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 531 S.E.2d 245 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court has the inherent power to discipline members of the bar.
   
   It can require attorneys to appear and answer charges based on records of the court. There is not a plaintiff in such a proceeding and a complaint does not have to be filed. In re Delk, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 543</cite>, 444 S.E.2d 198, reh'g denied, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 785</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 419 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction to Impose Discipline Sitting Judge.
   
   - Proceedings before the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission to discipline a sitting judge were dismissed because only the North Carolina Supreme Court or the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission had jurisdiction to discipline sitting judges for conduct in office. N.C. State Bar v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 264</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 743 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conditional Order Was "Final."
   
   - Entry of an order vacating attorney's disbarment and granting a conditional reinstatement of his right to practice law was a "final order" as contemplated by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-28ol1h" target="_self">G.S. 84-28(h)</a></cite>, as any future action was dependent upon a decision of the federal court, and not upon a further decision or action by the Disciplinary Hearing commission of the North Carolina State Bar. N.C. State Bar v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 705 S.E.2d 782 (2011).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The practice of law is a property right
   
   requiring due process of law before it may be impaired. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 277 S.E.2d 827 (1981), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Due Process Does Not Require Trial by Jury.
   
   - Defendant was not deprived of due process of law by virtue of the elimination by the 1975 amendment to this section of the right to trial by jury in attorney disciplinary matters; due process does not require that a jury trial be afforded an attorney for disciplinary or disbarment procedures and the procedural safeguards provided by the 1975 amendments were sufficient to satisfy due process requirements. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Due Process Requires Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard.
   
   - Where the attorney pleads guilty or is convicted in another court, or the conduct complained of is not related to litigation pending before the court investigating attorney's alleged misconduct, the procedure, to meet the test of due process, must be initiated by a sworn written complaint, and the court should issue a rule or order advising the attorney to the specific charges, directing him to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken, and granting a reasonable time for answering and preparation of defense, and attorney should be given full opportunity to be heard and permitted to have counsel for his defense. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581 (1962); In re Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 232 S.E.2d 497 (1977), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 638</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 784 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The doctrine of ex post facto laws does not apply
   
   to attorney disciplinary proceedings. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 277 S.E.2d 827 (1981), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Application of the procedures included in the 1975 amendment to this section did not constitute an unconstitutional ex post facto application of the law. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Former Law a "Disabling Statute".
   
   - The act of 1871, upon which C.S.,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   204 and 205, were based, failed to provide any power to take the place of the power formerly invested in the courts, and so was a disabling statute. Kane v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 1</cite> (1872); In re Ebbs, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 44</cite>, 63 S.E. 190 (1908). See <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-36" target="_self">G.S. 84-36</a></cite>.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Practice Law Not Interfered with.
   
   - This section only establishes procedures by which an attorney may be disciplined in the event that he violates the standards of professional conduct. Without some wrongful action on the part of an attorney, this section in no way interferes with an attorney's right to practice law. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 277 S.E.2d 827 (1981), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the practice of law is a property right requiring due process of law before it may be impaired, the 1975 amendment to this section in no way interfered with or impaired defendant's right to practice law. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule-Making Power of Council of North Carolina State Bar.
   
   - The 1937 amendment to this section, providing that the council of the North Carolina State Bar should have power to formulate rules of procedure governing disbarment proceedings which shall conform as near as may be to the procedure provided by law for hearings before referees in compulsory references, relates to the formulation of rules of procedure incident to hearings before the council or the trial committee and not to procedure upon appeal to the superior court. In re Gilliland, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 517</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 807 (1958).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney's Ethics Ordinarily for Consideration of State Bar.
   
   - By virtue of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-29" target="_self">G.S. 84-29</a></cite> to 84-32, questions relating to the propriety and ethics of an attorney are ordinarily for the consideration of the North Carolina State Bar. In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 192 S.E.2d 33, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 426</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 837 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The object of the regulations is to protect the public
   
   from unethical conduct by one vested with an attorney's license. A well-educated lawyer, whose position and achievement bring trusting persons to his office in a search of guidance and protection has the duty of conducting himself with the highest degree of honor, integrity and ethics. North Carolina State Bar v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 625</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 367, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 826, 88 S. Ct. 69, 19 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Disbarment Is to Protect Public.
   
   - An order disbarring an attorney upon his conviction of a felony is not entered as additional punishment, but as a protection to the public. State v. Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 45</cite>, 195 S.E. 1 (1938).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Civil Action.
   
   - Proceedings for disbarment are of a civil nature. In re Ebbs, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 44</cite>, 63 S.E. 190 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        The proceedings under each method by which disciplinary action or disbarment may be imposed partake of the nature of civil actions. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary proceedings against attorneys in North Carolina are civil proceedings, not criminal. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 277 S.E.2d 827 (1981), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In North Carolina there are two methods
   
   by which disciplinary action or disbarment may be imposed upon attorneys - statutory and judicial. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581 (1962); In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 192 S.E.2d 33, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 426</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 837 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory method
   
   by which disciplinary action or disbarment may be imposed provides for written complaint, notice to accused, opportunity to answer and be represented by counsel, hearing before a committee conducting proceedings in the nature of a reference, and trial by jury unless waived. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581 (1962); In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 192 S.E.2d 33, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 426</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 837 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inherent Powers of Court Not Abridged.
   
   - Nothing contained in the statutes concerning discipline or disbarment is to be construed as disabling or abridging the inherent powers of the court to deal with its attorneys. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581 (1962).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Complaint Need Not Be by Layman or Client.
   
   - It is not required that proceedings against an attorney for disbarment or suspension initiated by the council of the State Bar be based upon complaint of a layman or a client defrauded by the attorney. North Carolina State Bar v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 625</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 367, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 826, 88 S. Ct. 69, 19 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Council Is Not Limited to Any Particular Source for Information.
   
   - The duty of patrolling the conduct of licensed attorneys is placed on the council of the State Bar, and there are no requirements that it shall be limited to any particular source for its information or instigation of proceedings. North Carolina State Bar v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 625</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 367, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 826, 88 S. Ct. 69, 19 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section provides for disbarment for the conviction of a criminal offense showing professional unfitness. It does not limit this penalty to cases brought by the State Bar. In re Delk, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 543</cite>, 444 S.E.2d 198, reh'g denied, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 785</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 419 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Committee to Investigate Facts.
   
   - Where issues of fact are raised the court may appoint a committee to investigate and make report. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581 (1962); In re Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 232 S.E.2d 497 (1977), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 638</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 784 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary Proceedings Not Barred by Limitations.
   
   - Disciplinary proceedings are not barred by the general statute of limitations. Nor is a disciplinary proceeding barred because it is grounded on acts that also constitute a crime that cannot be prosecuted in a criminal action because of limitations. North Carolina State Bar v. Temple, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 91, 162 S.E.2d 649 (1968), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 437, 170 S.E.2d 131 (1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1023, 90 S. Ct. 1263, 25 L. Ed. 2d 532, reh'g denied, 397 U.S. 1081, 90 S. Ct. 1520 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Detention of Money or Property.
   
   - Under this section the detention of money received in his professional capacity without bona fide claim thereto is ground for the disbarment of an attorney. In re Escoffery, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 19</cite>, 3 S.E.2d 425 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inexperience in the legal profession cannot excuse detention of money collected for a client under circumstances which amount to embezzlement. Dishonesty and breach of trust may be committed by anyone, and no person needs a law license or experience in the practice of law to know that dishonesty and crookedness are wrong. North Carolina State Bar v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 625</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 367, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 826, 88 S. Ct. 69, 19 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1967).

        Findings Must Be Supported by Evidence.
   
   - In attorney discipline and disbarment proceedings, findings of fact must be supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence drawn from the whole record. North Carolina State Bar v. Speckman, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 116, 360 S.E.2d 129 (1987).

       <p>
        Substantial Evidence Supported Findings of Fact.
   
   - Substantial evidence supported the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission's findings that an attorney's misconduct created the potential for significant harm to clients and to the public's perception of the legal profession because the attorney's mismanagement of a trust account directly led to the potential misappropriation of client funds. N.C. State Bar v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 769 S.E.2d 406 (2015).

        Failure to Comply with Grievance Committee Subpoena.
   
   - A subpoena is a type of "formal inquiry" contemplated by the General Assembly in defining the grounds for attorney discipline under subdivision (b)(3) of this section; thus, where the defendant attorney failed to produce documents as required by a Grievance Committee subpoena, he was subject to discipline as a result and the Hearing Committee did not err in concluding that defendant violated subdivision (b)(3) of this section.

        Entry of Sanction Prior to Judgment of Conviction.
   
   - Where the Disciplinary Hearing Commission of the North Carolina State Bar was only required to find that the attorney was convicted of a criminal offense to impose discipline, it did not err in imposing discipline prior to entry of a judgment of conviction. N.C. State Bar v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 705 S.E.2d 782 (2011).

        Loss of Right to Claim Negligence of Attorney by Pursuing Initial Claim.
   
   - Where wife had a claim for permanent alimony which was lost by the negligence of her attorney, she then retained another attorney who filed a counterclaim for alimony, and the alimony agreement negotiated by the first attorney was rescinded and a second alimony agreement was signed, by pursuing her claim for alimony against her husband the wife lost her right to make a claim against the first attorney for his negligence in representing the plaintiff in her original alimony claim.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Acts Committed to Create Potential for Foreseeable Harm.
   
   - Disciplinary Hearing Commission did not err in concluding that an attorney intended to commit acts creating the potential for foreseeable harm because its findings supported the notion that the attorney's wrongful acts were not by mistake or accident but were instead intentionally committed; the attorney approved of emails being sent on her behalf with the intent of targeting small businesses in need of legal services, and she intended to communicate to a client that she was an attorney. N.C. State Bar v. Ely, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 810 S.E.2d 346 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Multiple Offenses.
   
   - Disciplinary Hearing Commission did not err in finding that an attorney committed multiple offenses because it properly concluded that the attorney violated the North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct by (1) holding herself out as legally able to provide legal services, (2) holding her law firm out on its website as authorized to provide legal services, (3) contacting a potential client via email, and (4) listing a lawyer as an attorney employed by her law firm on its website. N.C. State Bar v. Ely, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 810 S.E.2d 346 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Refusal to Acknowledge Wrongful Nature of Conduct.
   
   - Disciplinary Hearing Commission's (DHC) conclusion of law that an attorney refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of her conduct was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence because the attorney continually refused to accept the fact that her conduct was in violation of North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct; the DHC chairman repeatedly gave the attorney opportunities to acknowledge her violations, but she was unwilling to do so. N.C. State Bar v. Ely, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 810 S.E.2d 346 (2018).

         II. SANCTIONS.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Fine and imprisonment is not the appropriate remedy
   
   to be applied to an attorney who, by reason of moral delinquency or other cause, has shown himself to be an unworthy member of the profession. Kane v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 1</cite> (1872).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Censure Held Appropriate.
   
   - An order of public censure was not arbitrary and unreasonably harsh punishment for defendant attorney's unprofessional conduct in encouraging a potential adverse witness not to testify against his client, in a prosecution for driving under the influence of alcohol, in return for an agreement by the client not to give any testimony which might incriminate the potential witness, and it did not violate the defendant's rights to due process and equal protection. North Carolina State Bar v. Graves, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 274 S.E.2d 396 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no reversible error in the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission's imposition of a censure on an attorney where the attorney's failure to exercise due diligence in the representation of certain client matters, in violation of N.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct 1.3, constituted grounds for discipline under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-28" target="_self">G.S. 84-28</a></cite>. Because of the attorney's inaction, her clients were unable to present claims and defenses to the court. Although any one act, standing alone, would not have been sufficient to constitute a violation of the rule, together, the attorney's actions constituted a failure to act with reasonable diligence in violation of Rule 1.3. N.C. State Bar v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 719 S.E.2d 182 (2011), dismissed <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 552</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 791, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 201 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Censure was an appropriate discipline for an experienced attorney's conduct because the attorney did not exercise the proper supervisory authority sufficient to ensure that the work of a law firms' non-attorney staff employees with regards to a real estate closing was compatible with the attorney's professional obligations as the closing attorney. The attorney was previously disciplined for similar conduct and refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct. N.C. State Bar v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 773 S.E.2d 520 (2015).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere potential for harm to a client is a statutory factor that supports a reprimand,
   
   one of the lesser sanctions that may be imposed on an attorney by the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission; however, in order to justify the imposition of a more severe sanction, such as censure, suspension, or disbarment, the attorney's misconduct must show either significant harm or the potential for significant harm. N.C. State Bar v. Talford, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 626</cite>, 576 S.E.2d 305 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to impose a more severe sanction than reprimand under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-28" target="_self">G.S. 84-28</a></cite>, such as censure, suspension, or disbarment, an attorney's misconduct must include attending circumstances that demonstrate: (1) a risk of significant potential harm, and (2) that the chosen sanction is necessary in order to protect the public. N.C. State Bar v. Talford, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 626</cite>, 576 S.E.2d 305 (2003).

        Summary Disbarment by Court in Criminal Prosecution.
   
   - Where an attorney is on trial, charged with a criminal offense involving moral turpitude and amounting to a felony, and pleads guilty, or is convicted, or pleads nolo contendere with agreement that he will surrender his license, the court conducting the criminal trial has authority to disbar him summarily without further proceedings, and on appeal the Supreme Court may do likewise upon motion of the Attorney General. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581 (1962); In re Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sanctions Authorized by Statute Not Subject to Review.
   
   - Where an attorney's sanction, a one-year suspension, was by her own admission authorized by statute, it was not subject to review. North Carolina State Bar v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 777, 330 S.E.2d 280 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        So long as the punishment imposed is within the limits allowed by statute, the Court of Appeals does not have the authority to modify or change it. North Carolina State Bar v. Whitted, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 347 S.E.2d 60 (1986), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 354</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 501 (1987).

        Disbarment for Crime - Entry of Judgment of Conviction on Plea of Nolo Contendere.
   
   - Defendant's plea of nolo contendere in the Federal District Court to a charge of receiving and possessing chattels valued at less than $100 knowing them to have been stolen or embezzled does not entitle the State Bar to summary judgment authorizing disciplinary action against the defendant. North Carolina State Bar v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 539</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 521 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Same - Nature of Offense.
   
   - Under Laws 1870-1, c. 216, s. 4, upon which an action for disbarment was originally based, conviction of a "criminal offense" showing untrustworthiness was sufficient basis for disbarment; but by Laws 1907, c. 941, s. 1, conviction of a "felony" was necessary; construing these provisions together the court held that the two provisions were consistent and reconcilable (a view evidently adopted by the Revision Commission of 1920, as C.S.,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   205 contained the language of both provisions), and further stated that the conviction of a criminal offense - the illegal sale of liquor - was sufficient grounds for disbarment as showing the attorney unfit for practice. State ex rel. Solicitor v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 799</cite>, 88 S.E. 437 (1916). See also State ex rel. McLean v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 345</cite>, 93 S.E. 847 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        It having appeared to the court that the defendant was guilty of an infamous misdemeanor, converted to a felony by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia01s14-1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-1</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia01s14-3" target="_blank">G.S. 14-3</a></cite>, the court by virtue of its inherent power was authorized to order his name stricken from the rolls of attorneys and his license to practice law in the State of North Carolina returned to the Supreme Court, which issued it. State v. Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 45</cite>, 195 S.E. 1 (1938); State v. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 261</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 214 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where attorney contended that there was not a finding that he was convicted of any crime because the order only said "the records of this Court disclose" that he was convicted, the fact that the records of the court disclosed he had been convicted of a crime showing he was unfit to practice law, was a sufficient finding of fact to support disbarment. In re Delk, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 543</cite>, 444 S.E.2d 198, reh'g denied, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 785</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 419 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Same - Confession of a Felony.
   
   - A plea of guilty to an indictment charging defendant with willfully, feloniously, secretly, and maliciously giving aid and assistance to his codefendant by manufacturing evidence, altering and destroying original records in the office of the Commissioner of Revenue (now Secretary of Revenue), etc., was held a confession of a felony, and ground for disbarment if defendant was a practicing attorney, under former G.S. 205 of the Consolidated Statutes. State v. Harwood, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 87</cite>, 173 S.E. 24 (1934).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction or Confession of Guilt.
   
   - The words "conviction" and "confession," as used in a former statute providing that no attorney should be disbarred for crime unless upon conviction or confession in open court must be construed to convey the idea that the party had been convicted by a jury or had in open court declined to take issue by the plea of not guilty, and confessed himself guilty. Kane v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 1</cite> (1872).
       </p>
       <p>
        The admission of an attorney in an answer to a rule to show cause why he should not be attached for contempt for failure to pay money into court, not being voluntary, was not a confession in open court as contemplated by the statutes. Kane v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 1</cite> (1872).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment.
   
   - By a proper construction of the former statute, the court was shorn of its power to disbar an attorney, except in the single instance where he had been indicted for some criminal offense, showing him unfit to be trusted in the discharge of the duties of his profession, and upon such indictment had either been convicted or pleaded guilty. Kane v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 1</cite> (1872).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction in Foreign State.
   
   - Laws 1870-1, c. 216, s. 4, and Laws 1907, c. 941, s. 1, did not confer upon the court the power to disbar an attorney because he had been "convicted" in the courts of another state or of the United States. In re Ebbs, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 44</cite>, 63 S.E. 190 (1908).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Suspension.
   
   - Court of appeals rejected challenges which an attorney made to procedures used by the Disciplinary Hearing Commission (DHC) to hear allegations that the attorney made false statements, filed a motion for improper purposes, charged an excessive fee, and engaged in other misconduct, and it upheld the DHC's decision suspending the attorney's license to practice law for three years. N.C. State Bar v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 596 S.E.2d 337 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission (DHC) of the North Carolina State Bar suspending an attorney fell short of containing clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supporting the discipline imposed upon the attorney because the DHC's findings of fact in the adjudicatory phase failed to support the conclusions made in the dispositional section of the order, and admonition was not considered by the DHC in making its determination with regard to lesser sanctions; the DHC must show a reviewing court that all potential lesser sanctions have been considered before discipline of a greater nature is imposed. N.C. State Bar v. Sossomon, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 261, 676 S.E.2d 910 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission's order included findings of fact and conclusions of law that satisfied subsection (c) because the order explained how the attorney's actions resulted in significant potential harm and why suspension was the only sanction option that can adequately serve to protect the public from potential future transgressions by the attorney. N.C. State Bar v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 769 S.E.2d 406 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney was suspended from practice of law for five years after the attorney violated various rules of professional conduct by interjecting questions and commentary into a deposition and coaching the deponent, leaving a deposition without filing a motion to terminate it, knowingly making a false statement to a court, spoke disrespectfully to a judge at a bench conference, and sending a demand letter to an individual he knew was represented by counsel. N.C. State Bar v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 85, 791 S.E.2d 881 (2016), appeal dismissed, 797 S.E.2d 296, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 223 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary Hearing Commission properly suspended an attorney's license because its finding that she falsely held herself out as being able to provide legal services was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence; the attorney's law firm website did not contain any statement or suggestion that the attorney was not currently licensed to practice law in North Carolina, and thus, any client would have been under the false impression that she was licensed to provide legal services. N.C. State Bar v. Ely, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 810 S.E.2d 346 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary Hearing Commission properly suspended an attorney's license because the attorney held herself out as a lawyer who was admitted to practice law in North Carolina; the attorney identified herself as a Chief Legal Officer on her law firm's website, provided her background as an attorney on the website with no indication that her license was suspended, and emailed a potential client a link to the website and used the title "Esq." in the signature line of her email. N.C. State Bar v. Ely, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 810 S.E.2d 346 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary Hearing Commission properly suspended an attorney's license because the attorney held her law firm out as a company that could provide legal services and advice to a client when lawyers advertised on the website as Chief Legal Officers were not licensed to practice law in North Carolina. N.C. State Bar v. Ely, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 810 S.E.2d 346 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary Hearing Commission properly suspended an attorney's license because the attorney violated the prohibition against soliciting professional employment via electronic contact; the attorney emailed a potential client for the express purpose of promoting her law firm's legal services and, therefore, increasing her opportunity to obtain pecuniary gain. N.C. State Bar v. Ely, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 810 S.E.2d 346 (2018).
       </p>

        Disciplinary Hearing Commission properly suspended an attorney's license because the attorney falsely represented on her law firm's website that a lawyer could serve as an attorney on behalf of the law firm despite his status with the State Bar being "inactive" as well as the fact that he had never actually signed a contract with the law firm; the attorney included the hyperlink to the website in her emails to a potential client and other recipients. N.C. State Bar v. Ely, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 810 S.E.2d 346 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary Hearing Commission's (DHC) decision to suspend an attorney's license for five years did not exceed its statutory authority because DHC's order sufficiently linked the attorney's multiple instances of improper conduct to the potential for significant harm to the public; the DHC expressly weighed the other disciplinary options available to it before ultimately determining that a lesser sanction would fail to adequately address the severity of her misconduct. N.C. State Bar v. Ely, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 810 S.E.2d 346 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary Hearing Commission properly suspended an attorney's license because the clear implication from the attorney's inclusion of the abbreviation "Esq." following her signature in her emails to a potential client, the hyperlink to her law firm's website, and her testimony at the hearing was that she intended to convey to recipients of the email that she was able to provide legal services as an attorney. N.C. State Bar v. Ely, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 810 S.E.2d 346 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary Hearing Commission properly suspended an attorney's license because the attorney listed a lawyer as a Chief Legal Officer whose credentials could be viewed on her law firm's website even though the lawyer never signed an employment contract with the firm, and his license to practice law in North Carolina was inactive; a potential North Carolina client viewing the website would assume that the lawyer was authorized to provide legal services in North Carolina.

        Trial court sanctioned a lawyer for characterizing her opposing counsel and their witnesses as liars;
   
   its order that she be suspended from practicing law pro hac vice in North Carolina for one year was not an abuse of discretion. Couch v. Private Diagnostic Clinic, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite> 658, 554 S.E.2d 356 (2001), cert. denied, cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 348</cite>, 563 S.E.2d 562 (2002).

       </p>
       <p>
        Disbarment Held Not Appropriate.
   
   - Though an attorney violated the disciplinary rules regarding trust accounts by commingling funds and failing to keep proper records, as there was no evidence that he benefitted from this misconduct, or that any client was harmed by it, the order disbarring him was reversed as an abuse of discretion. N.C. State Bar v. Talford, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 581, 556 S.E.2d 344 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Disbarment Held Proper.
   
   - Attorney was properly disbarred after the attorney failed to properly maintain a trust account and commingled client funds and operational funds; implicit in the finding that the attorney violated N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 8.4(b) and (c), was a determination that the attorney's misconduct posed a significant potential harm to clients. N.C. State Bar v. Leonard, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 632 S.E.2d 183 (2006), review denied, - N.C.
   - , 641 S.E.2d 693 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 220</cite>, - S.E.2d - (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary Hearing Commission(DHC) properly disbarred an attorney for embezzling client funds because there was substantial evidence that the attorney knowingly and willfully misappropriated client funds, the Rules of Professional Conduct did not require a conviction, the attorney's actions harmed the attorney's clients, the administration of justice, the profession, and the public, and the DHC considered all lesser sanctions and explained why disbarment was the only adequate sanction. N.C. State Bar v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 669, 757 S.E.2d 357 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney's disbarment was reversed since the statutory scheme in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-28" target="_self">G.S. 84-28</a></cite> clearly evidenced an intent to punish attorneys in an escalating fashion,
   
   keyed to the harm or potential harm created by the misconduct and a demonstrable need to protect the public; the North Carolina Disciplinary Hearing Commission did not expressly address how the attorney's failure to maintain accurate records might result in harm to a client, the public, or the legal profession, and therefore, the Commission exceeded its statutory authority when it disbarred the attorney. N.C. State Bar v. Talford, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 626</cite>, 576 S.E.2d 305 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admonishment.
   
   - Disciplinary commission did not err by ordering the issuance of an admonition as opposed to a less serious sanction for the attorney's misconduct in stating on his letterhead and website that he had been published in the federal appellate court reporter; a showing of public harm was not required and such discipline was within the statutory limits of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-28" target="_self">G.S. 84-28</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Test on Appeal.
   
   - Due process does not require the "clear, cogent and convincing" test in determining whether plaintiff satisfied its burden of proof rather than the "greater weight of the evidence" rule. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Whole Record" Test.
   
   - The test for determining whether the findings of the disciplinary committee are supported by the evidence is the "whole record" test. Under this test there must be substantial evidence, based on a review of the record, to support the committee's findings, conclusions and results. North Carolina State Bar v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 777, 330 S.E.2d 280 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disciplinary commission's finding that the attorney's statements on his letterhead and website to the effect that the attorney had been published in the federal appellate court reporter were inherently misleading in multiple respects was supported by the "whole record" test; analysis of the whole record showed that the disciplinary commission's finding was supported by substantial evidence and no abuse of discretion was shown in thus ordering as discipline that he be admonished. N.C. State Bar v. Culbertson, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 627 S.E.2d 644 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Whole record test" is standard for judicial review
   
   of attorney discipline cases and requires the reviewing court to consider the evidence which in and of itself justifies or supports the administrative findings and also to take into account the contradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences can be drawn. The evidence is substantial if, when considered as a whole, it is such that a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. North Carolina State Bar v. Speckman, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 116, 360 S.E.2d 129 (1987).

        Appeals from Decisions of State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission.
   
   - Article 4 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150A</a></cite> (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba04s150B-43" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-43</a></cite> et seq.) is the controlling judicial review statute for appeals from decisions of the State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supported the Disciplinary Hearing Commission's findings and conclusions that the attorney violated N.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct Rule 1.16, regarding the termination of representation, Rule 1.3, about neglecting client matters, and Rule 8.4, prejudicing the administration of justice, in violation of an earlier Consent Order of Discipline resulting in the attorney's license suspension. The attorney's conduct violated those rules because the attorney stopped representing the client when the client notified the attorney that she could not pay an additional sum to represent the client on probation violation matters, and the attorney did not obtain permission from the trial court to withdraw from representing her after the attorney had appeared on her behalf. N.C. State Bar v. Key, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 616, 654 S.E.2d 55 (2007), aff'd on rehearing, 658 S.E.2d 493, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 425 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        State Has Right to Appeal.
   
   - Under the statutory method of disciplinary attorneys any party, including the attorney in question and the State Bar, may appeal from a decision of the disciplinary hearing commission. In re Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 638</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 784 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State may seek review by the appellate division of proceedings disciplining attorneys under the judicial method, not as a matter of right, but by petition for writ of certiorari. In re Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 638</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 784 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty of Judge on Appeal from Council.
   
   - It is the duty of the superior court judge, on appeal from the council, to consider the evidence and give his own opinion and conclusion, both upon the facts and the law. He is not permitted to do this in a perfunctory way, but he must deliberate and decide as in other cases, use his own faculties in ascertaining the truth, and form his own judgment as to fact and law. North Carolina State Bar v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 625</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 367, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 826, 88 S. Ct. 69, 19 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Power of Judge with Respect to Report of Council.
   
   - Since this section provides that the proceedings in the superior court shall be in accordance with the laws and rules relating to civil actions in which there has been a reference by consent, the judge of the superior court may affirm, amend, modify, set aside, make additional findings, and confirm in whole or in part, or disaffirm the report of the council. North Carolina State Bar v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 625</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 367, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 826, 88 S. Ct. 69, 19 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Power of Reviewing Court to Change Discipline.
   
   - Subsection (h) of this section does not give a reviewing court the authority to modify or change the discipline properly imposed by the commission. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Power of Reviewing Court to Modify or Change Imposed Punishment.
   
   - So long as the punishment imposed is within the limits allowed by the statute the court does not have the authority to modify or change it. North Carolina State Bar v. Nelson, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 421 S.E.2d 163 (1992), aff'd per curiam, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 786</cite>, 429 S.E.2d 716 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition of Greater Punishment on Appeal to Superior Court.
   
   - On appeal from disciplinary action taken by the State Bar, an attorney cannot complain that the punishment imposed by the superior court was greater than the punishment imposed by the council of the State Bar from which he had appealed. North Carolina State Bar v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 625</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 367, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 826, 88 S. Ct. 69, 19 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction Lacking
   
   - Court of Appeals of North Carolina lacked jurisdiction to hear the State Bar of North Carolina's appeal of a grant of summary judgment to an attorney in a disciplinary proceeding because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-28ol1h" target="_self">G.S. 84-28(h)</a></cite> provided no appeal from a final order that did not impose discipline and in the instant case, no discipline had been imposed. N.C. State Bar v. Rudisill, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 704, 583 S.E.2d 413 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Collateral Attack on State Bar Decision to Disbar Attorney.
   
   - Former attorney's suit, alleging that the North Carolina State Bar's decision disbarring him was contrary to a State supreme court decision decided five years after his disbarment and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on certain constitutional arguments, was properly dismissed because, while the Bar was not a court of competent jurisdiction, the attorney could not present his claims in superior court because they were a collateral attack on a final judgment properly entered by the Bar, and the attorney did not avail himself of his right of appeal to the court under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-28ol1h" target="_self">G.S. 84-28(h)</a></cite>; even assuming that the attorney's case was factually similar to the State supreme court's decision, nothing in the opinion indicated that the decision was retroactive to cases finalized prior to the decision. Clayton v. N.C. State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 717, 608 S.E.2d 821 (2005), cert. denied, - N.C.
   - , 615 S.E.2d 867 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Appeal Renders Order Final and Insulated from Collateral Attack.
   
   - Petitioner, a suspended lawyer, filed a motion for reinstatement of his license to practice law. However, the lawyer was required to petition for such relief in the form and subject to the substantive rules set out in 27 N.C. Admin. Code
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   01B.0125(b); his motion also represented an impermissible collateral attack on the Disciplinary Hearing Commission's order refusing to reinstate his law license. When the lawyer failed to seek appellate review of the denial of his reinstatement petition in a timely manner, the order refusing to reinstate his license to practice law became final and thus was insulated from collateral attack. In re McGee, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 325, 719 S.E.2d 222 (2011), review denied <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 557</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 596, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 142 (2012).

       Jurisdiction.
   
   - Proceedings before the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission to discipline a sitting judge were dismissed because only the North Carolina Supreme Court or the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission had jurisdiction to discipline sitting judges for conduct in office. N.C. State Bar v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 264</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 743 (2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Public Duty Doctrine Applied to Claim Against Disciplinary Hearing Commission.
   
   - Disbarred attorney's claim against the Disciplinary Hearing Commission for negligent infliction of emotional distress in the performance of its duties came under the public duty doctrine, since the Commission was acting within its statutory authority under this section when it held plaintiff in criminal contempt. Frazier v. Murray, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 43, 519 S.E.2d 525 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Disciplinary Hearing Commission had contempt power over a plaintiff who has already been disbarred
   
   and the right to lawfully exercise that contempt power. Disciplinary Hearing Comm'n v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 540 S.E.2d 758 (2000), cert. granted sub nom. North Carolina State Bar v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 378</cite>, 547 S.E.2d 434 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission did not have authority to discipline previously disbarred attorney
   
   or find him in criminal contempt for unauthorized practice of law because its authority was extinguished following disbarment; the process of seeking criminal sanctions for the unlawful practice of law was under the exclusive control of district attorneys. Disciplinary Hearing Comm'n of the N.C. State Bar v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 555</cite>, 556 S.E.2d 262 (2001).

      <p>
       Procedure.
   
   - Disciplinary Hearing Commission (DHC) properly denied an attorney's motion for separate hearings on charges that he made false statements and committed other acts of misconduct while representing a client in one case, and while he was involved in a dispute with his neighbors in a separate case, and the DHC did not err when it considered evidence that the attorney had two misdemeanor convictions and had previously received a letter of warning from the State Bar when it determined an appropriate sanction.

     <p>
      In any investigation of charges of professional misconduct or disability or in petitions for reinstatement, the Council and any committee thereof, and the disciplinary hearing commission, and any committee thereof, may administer oaths and affirmations and shall have the power to subpoena and examine witnesses under oath, and to compel their attendance, and the production of books, papers and other documents or writings deemed by it necessary or material to the inquiry. Each subpoena shall be issued under the hand of the secretary-treasurer or the president of the Council or the chair of the committee appointed to hear the charges, and shall have the force and effect of a summons or subpoena issued by a court of record, and any witness or other person who shall refuse or neglect to appear in obedience thereto, or to testify or produce the books, papers, or other documents or writings required, shall be liable to punishment for contempt either by the Council or its committee or a hearing committee of the disciplinary hearing commission through its chair pursuant to the procedures set out in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, but with the right to appeal therefrom. Depositions may be taken in any investigations of professional misconduct as in civil proceedings, but the Council or the committee hearing the case may, in its discretion, whenever it believes that the ends of substantial justice so require, direct that any witness within the State be brought before it. Witnesses giving testimony under a subpoena before the Council or any committee thereof, or the disciplinary hearing commission or any committee thereof, or by deposition, shall be entitled to the same fees as in civil actions.
     </p>
     <p>
      In cases heard before the Council or any committee thereof or the disciplinary hearing commission or any committee thereof, if the party shall be convicted of the charges, the party shall be taxed with the cost of the hearings: Provided, however, that the bill of costs shall not include any compensation to the members of the Council or committee before whom the hearings are conducted.

       Construction with Fifth Amendment Rights.
   
   - This section did not cause the defendant to be compelled in violation of his constitutional rights by the State bar to provide information which would later be used against him in a perjury case where he, acting of his own volition, made statements to the bar investigator. The record does not indicate that these statements were extracted under the power of a subpoena; and the defendant was not in custody at the time these statements were made. The defendant could have asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege during the bar proceedings although the protection would not have extended to any records that he was required by law to maintain.

       Constitutionality.
   
   - This section, giving the State Bar Council the discretion to reinstate the license to practice law of a disbarred attorney is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. In re Garrison, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 158, 260 S.E.2d 445 (1979), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 545</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 404 (1980).

       The council did not err in the denial of petitioner's application for reinstatement
   
   of his license to practice law where there was evidence that petitioner had compromised four of the six civil judgments rendered against him but had failed to make restitution for two outstanding judgments against him in excess of $30,000, which he had been unable to compromise, and that petitioner also renounced funds which would have enabled him to help satisfy the judgments against him. Petitioner's willingness to satisfy only the judgments that could be compromised, while failing to satisfy those not the subject of compromise, is evidence of the lack of proper reformation required by the statute.

      </h4>
      <p>
       In North Carolina there are two methods by which disciplinary action or disbarment may be imposed
   
   upon attorneys - statutory and judicial. In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 192 S.E.2d 33, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 426</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 837 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Concurrent Power of Supreme Court and Bar to Regulate Conduct of Attorneys.
   
   - While questions of propriety and ethics are ordinarily for the consideration of the bar, because that organization was expressly created by the legislature to deal with such questions, nevertheless the power to regulate the conduct of attorneys is held concurrently by the Bar and the Supreme Court. Therefore, in a proper case, the Court may rule on questions concerning the conduct of attorneys. Gardner v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 285</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 517 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Powers of Court Distinguished from Powers Granted to State Bar.
   
   - This inherent power is co-equal and co-extensive with the statutory grant of powers to the North Carolina State Bar, and, while the interests of the two entities having disciplinary jurisdiction may, and often do, overlap, they are not always identical and as the interests sought to be protected by the court's inherent power are distinct from those of the North Carolina State Bar, the action of a court in disciplining or disqualifying an attorney practicing before it is not in derogation or to the exclusion of similar action by the Bar. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 182, 296 N.C. 740, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of the court to regulate and discipline attorneys is an inherent one because it is an essential one for the court to possess in order for it to protect itself from fraud and impropriety and to serve the ends of the administration of justice which are, fundamentally, the raison d'etre for the existence and operation of the courts. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 182, 296 N.C. 740, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court's inherent power is not limited or bound by the technical precepts contained in the Code of Professional Responsibility as administered by the Bar. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 182, 296 N.C. 740, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979).

      <p>
       Suspension of Attorney as Sanction.
   
   - Trial judge had the authority, recognized in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-36" target="_self">G.S. 84-36</a></cite>, to sanction an attorney, and the sanction of a one-year suspension imposed by the judge was not an abuse of discretion; the attorney willfully abandoned a client at the client's probation hearing, refused to represent the client when confronted with his ethical and legal obligations by the trial judge, made comments questioning the authority of the judge, made an obscene reference to the judge, and behaved rudely towards the courtroom clerk. In re Key, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 714, 643 S.E.2d 452 (2007), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 428</cite>, 648 S.E.2d 506 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       General Assembly Cannot Abridge Inherent Power.
   
   - The existence of inherent judicial power is not dependent upon legislative action; however, the General Assembly has recognized the existence of the inherent power of the court and the General Assembly cannot abridge that power. Beard v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 126</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 694 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Judicial Method Is Not Dependent upon Statutory Authority.
   
   - It arises because of a court's inherent authority to take disciplinary action against attorneys licensed before it; an authority which extends even to matters which are not pending in the particular court exercising the authority. In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 192 S.E.2d 33, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 426</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 837 (1972); In re Paul, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 353 S.E.2d 254, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 673</cite>, 356 S.E.2d 779 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Basis of Court's Power.
   
   - A court's power is based upon the relationship of the attorney to the court and the authority which the court has over its own officers to prevent them from, or punish them for, acts of dishonesty or impro- priety calculated to bring contempt upon the administration of justice. In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 192 S.E.2d 33, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 426</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 837 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Form of Disciplinary Action.
   
   - Judicial disciplinary action may take the form of an order of disbarment or suspension of the attorney's privilege to practice law. In re Paul, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 353 S.E.2d 254, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 673</cite>, 356 S.E.2d 779 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory Method of Disbarment Not Exclusive.
   
   - C.S.,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   204 and 205, restricting the power of courts to disbar attorneys, were repealed by Laws 1933, c. 210, s. 20, and the statutory method of disbarment provided by the act of 1933 is not exclusive, but on the contrary the act recognizes the inherent power of the courts, and the courts have jurisdiction to order the disbarment of an attorney upon his conviction of an infamous misdemeanor, converted to a felony by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia01s14-1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-1</a></cite> and 14-3. State v. Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 45</cite>, 195 S.E. 1 (1938). See also State ex rel. McLean v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 345</cite>, 93 S.E. 847 (1917).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Due Process Required.
   
   - While it is incontrovertible that the courts have inherent authority to take disciplinary action against attorneys practicing therein, even in relation to matters not pending in the particular court exercising that authority, it is not after the manner of the courts, however, to deprive a lawyer, any more than anyone else, of his constitutional guaranties or to revoke his license without due process of law. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No statute provides for a jury trial when the judicial method is employed
   
   to seek disciplinary action against an attorney practicing in this State. In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 192 S.E.2d 33, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 426</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 837 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       This State has never had a statute which expressly conferred upon an attorney the right to a trial by jury in a judicial disciplining or disbarment proceeding. Since no such right existed at common law, or by statute at the time our Constitution was adopted, and is not now provided for by statute, appellant's motion for a trial by jury was properly denied. In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 192 S.E.2d 33, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 426</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 837 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Due Process Procedures Under Judicial Method.
   
   - Under the judicial method, the procedure, to meet the test of due process, must be initiated by a sworn written complaint, and the court should issue a rule or order advising the attorney of the specific charges, directing him to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken, and granting a reasonable time for answering and preparation of defense, and attorney should be given full opportunity to be heard and permitted to have counsel for his defense; where issues of fact are raised the court may appoint a committee to investigate and make report. In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 192 S.E.2d 33, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 426</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 837 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Disbarment Order Supported by Contempt Conviction.
   
   - The trial court's findings of fact supported order disbarring respondent attorney, where respondent was convicted of contempt for soliciting someone to disrupt a criminal trial in which he, respondent, represented the defendant. In re Paul, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 353 S.E.2d 254, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 673</cite>, 356 S.E.2d 779 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Error in Dismissing Grievance Filed with State Bar.
   
   - North Carolina State Bar and the trial courts of this State share concurrent jurisdiction over matters of attorney discipline; therefore, where individual filed a civil claim against attorney for alleged impropriety in handling an estate, and also filed a grievance with the State Bar alleging that the attorney's actions violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, the trial court erred in naming the State Bar as a party and dismissing the grievance proceeding against the defendant. North Carolina State Bar v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 699</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 185 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Client Security Fund Constitutional.
   
   - The order of the North Carolina Supreme Court establishing the Client Security Fund and requiring annual payments by attorneys to the Fund is an essential corollary to the court's function, was required for the proper administration of justice, and did not violate the North Carolina Constitution. Beard v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 126</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 694 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Fee Dispute Resolution Did Not Abridge Authority of Courts.
   
   - Trial court did not err by dismissing an attorney's claim against his client for fees for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 12(b)(1), because jurisdiction over the fee dispute was vested with the North Carolina State Bar under N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(f) and 27 N.C. Admin. Code 01D.0702, depriving the trial court of jurisdiction to the claims until the fee dispute resolution process had concluded. This conclusion did not impermissibly disable or abridge the courts' inherent authority over attorney conduct in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t84a04s84-36" target="_self">G.S. 84-36</a></cite>.

        Constitutionality.
       </b>
       - State prosecutors were properly granted summary judgment in action to enjoin enforcement of North Carolina's unauthorized practice of law statutes because statutes did not unconstitutionally restrict trade association's associational rights, statutes survived intermediate scrutiny and did not unlawfully burden association's freedom of speech as state had established reasonable fit between statutes and substantial government interest in regulating legal profession to protect clients, statutes did not deny association due process as there was rational basis to restrict corporate ownership of professional businesses to protect consumers, statutes were not vague, and statutes did not violate state constitution's Monopoly Clause. Capital Associated Indus. v. Stein, 922 F.3d 198 (4th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 666, 205 L. Ed. 2d 438, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 7540 (U.S. 2019).
