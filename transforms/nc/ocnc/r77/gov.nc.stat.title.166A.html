                <p>
                    An employee of a State agency who is a disaster service volunteer of the American Red Cross may be granted leave from his work with pay for a time not to exceed 15 work days in any 12-month period to participate in specialized disaster relief services
                    for the American Red Cross. To be granted leave, the request for the services of that employee must come from the American Red Cross. The decision to grant the employee leave rests in the sole discretion of the employing State agency
                    based on the work needs of that agency. Employees granted leave pursuant to this Article shall not lose seniority, pay, vacation time, sick time, or earned overtime accumulation. The State agency shall compensate an employee granted
                    leave under this Article at the regular rate of pay for those regular work hours during which the employee is absent from his work. Leave under this Article shall be granted only for services related to a disaster occurring within
                    the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The State of North Carolina shall not be liable for workers compensation claims arising from accident or injury while the State employee is on assignment as a disaster service volunteer for the American Red Cross. Duties performed while on disaster leave
                    shall not be considered to be a work assignment by a state agency. The employee is granted leave based on the need for the employee's area of expertise. Job functions although similar or related are performed on behalf of and for the
                    benefit of the American Red Cross.
