                        Purpose. - The provisions of this section are designed to protect unit owners from shouldering a disproportionate share of the maintenance expenses for common areas when other unit owners, including the developer, attempt to unilaterally exempt themselves
                        from contributing their pro rata share of maintenance expenses. Dunes South Homeowners Ass'n v. First Flight Bldrs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 125</cite>, 459 S.E.2d 477 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Developer as Unit Owner. - Neither the definition of "unit owner" in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t47Aa01s47A-3" target="_self">G.S. 47A-3</a></cite> nor the provisions of this section make any distinction between a developer and
                        any other unit owner; defendant developer, as a corporation owning several units within the condominium project, qualified as a "unit owner" and was bound to contribute pro rata toward the expenses of administration and of maintenance
                        and repair of the general common areas and facilities. Dunes South Homeowners Ass'n v. First Flight Bldrs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 125</cite>, 459 S.E.2d 477 (1995).

                        Developer Not Exempt. - The legislature did not intend to allow a developer, as a unit owner, to unilaterally exempt itself from the payment of its pro rata share of the maintenance expenses for the common areas. Dunes South Homeowners Ass'n v. First
                        Flight Bldrs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 125</cite>, 459 S.E.2d 477 (1995).

                        Special Assessment Invalid. - Condominium association's special assessment against the unit owners of one building in a larger complex was invalid as it was neither uniform, nor levied on a pro rata basis as required by the North Carolina Unit Ownership
                        Act, specifically <cite class="octn"><a href="#t47Aa01s47A-12" target="_self">G.S. 47A-12</a></cite>, and the condominium declaration; although an assessment in 2005 was levied for the renovation of 32 of
                        the other buildings in the complex, the association's claim that the two assessments were piecemeal phases of a single larger assessment was rejected as the trial court found as a matter of fact that there were two assessments.

                    <p>
                        Suit to Foreclose Lien Improperly Dismissed. - Condominium association's suit to foreclose a lien imposed for improvements the association made to a certain building was improperly dismissed when the related costs were not imposed on all unit owners on
                        a pro rata basis, as <cite class="octn"><a href="#t47Aa01s47A-12" target="_self">G.S. 47A-12</a></cite> required, because improvements to a unit's exterior windows and doors solely benefitted the owners
                        of the units against which the lien was imposed, while other improvements benefitted common areas, and the trial court made no separate findings and conclusions distinguishing between the two. In re Proposed Foreclosure of Claim
                        of Lien Filed Against Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 535, 714 S.E.2d 169 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Collateral Estoppel. - Condominium owner was estopped from relitigating whether the cost of exterior doors and windows had to be separately apportioned from the cost of common area improvements in a special assessment because the dismissal of a foreclosure
                        proceeding operated as a final adjudication on the merits; whether the owner's board of directors was required to separately apportion the cost was identical to the issue actually litigated and necessary to the judgment at issue
                        in the foreclosure cases. Johnson v. Starboard Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 781 S.E.2d 813 (2016).

                        A declarant of a condominium containing conversion buildings, and any person in the business of selling real estate for his own account who intends to offer units in such a condominium, shall provide each of the residential tenants and any residential
                        subtenant in possession of a portion of a conversion building notice of the conversion as well as an offering statement as provided in G.S. 47A-35 no later than 90 days before the tenant or subtenant are required to vacate. The
                        notice shall set forth generally the rights of tenants and subtenants under this section and section (b) of G.S. 47A-36. This notice shall be hand-delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States mail to the tenant and
                        subtenant at the address of the unit or any other mailing address provided by a tenant. No tenant or subtenant may be required to vacate upon less than 90 days' notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, conduct that
                        disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises or breach of lease giving rise to the right of repossession of the unit by the declarant, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during that period. Failure to
                        give notice as required by this section is a defense to an action for possession.

                        For 30 days after the delivery of the notice described in subsection (a), the person required to give the notice shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases that unit. The tenant can accept an
                        offer under this section by entering into an agreement to purchase within the 30-day period. The tenant shall be allowed a 30-day period after acceptance in which to complete a purchase transaction. This subsection does not apply
                        to any unit in a conversion building if that unit will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit before conversion.
