      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      From and after July 1, 1957, it shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association, or other business entity in this State to act as a real estate broker, or directly or indirectly to engage or assume to engage in the business of real estate broker or to advertise or hold himself or herself or themselves out as engaging in or conducting such business without first obtaining a license issued by the North Carolina Real Estate Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission), under the provisions of this Chapter. A license shall be obtained from the Commission even if the person, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association, or business entity is licensed in another state and is affiliated or otherwise associated with a licensed real estate broker in this State.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Constitutionality.
   
   - The real estate business affects a substantial public interest and may be regulated for the purpose of protecting and promoting the general welfare of the people. State v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 690</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 660 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       This Chapter was declared constitutional in State v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 690</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 660 (1960); McArver v. Gerukos, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 413</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 277 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this Chapter
   
   is to protect sellers, purchasers, lessors and lessees of real property from fraudulent or incompetent brokers and salespersons. McArver v. Gerukos, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 413</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 277 (1965); North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd. v. Aikens, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C.

App.</cite> 541, 503 S.E.2d 401 (1998), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 41</cite>, 519 S.E.2d 314 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter Must Be Strictly Construed.
   
   - Because this is a statute restricting to a special class of persons the right to engage in a lawful occupation, this Chapter must be strictly construed so as not to extend it to activities and transactions not intended by the legislature to be included. McArver v. Gerukos, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 413</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 277 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       This Chapter must be construed with a regard to the evil which it is intended to suppress. McArver v. Gerukos, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 413</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 277 (1965); North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd. v. Aikens, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 8, 228 S.E.2d 493 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section must be construed with a regard to the evil that it is intended to suppress, and as a criminal offense, it must be strictly construed so as not to extend it to activities and transactions not intended by the legislature to be included. Furr v. Fonville Morisey Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 541, 503 S.E.2d 401 (1998), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 41</cite>, 519 S.E.2d 314 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Any violation of its provisions is declared to be a criminal offense.
   
   McArver v. Gerukos, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 413</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 277 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       One who conducts activities pursuant to a finder's fee contract
   
   is engaged indirectly in the business of being a real estate broker or salesperson. Davis v. Sellers, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 443 S.E.2d 879 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 610</cite>, 454 S.E.2d 248 (1995).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       In-State and Out-of State Brokers.
   
   - In a real estate transaction involving an out-of-state buyer/lessee, the interests of the parties are better served if the out-of-state party is allowed to rely on the combined efforts of a local broker and a broker familiar with its particular situation, and in such an arrangement the North Carolina broker will be legally and professionally responsible for the acts of the cooperating out-of-state broker as well as for its own acts in the venture. Furr v. Fonville Morisey Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 541, 503 S.E.2d 401 (1998), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 41</cite>, 519 S.E.2d 314 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlicensed Foreign Brokers.
   
   - A lease transaction involving North Carolina real property in which a local and an out-of-state broker cooperated was not void against public policy simply because the out-of-state broker was not licensed in North Carolina. Furr v. Fonville Morisey Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 541, 503 S.E.2d 401 (1998), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 41</cite>, 519 S.E.2d 314 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Contract Unenforceable.
   
   - Marketing firm was not entitled to maintain an action to collect on a contract to pay real estate commissions because it was undisputed that the marketing firm was not licensed as a real estate broker in North Carolina, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t93Aa01s93A-1" target="_self">G.S. 93A-1</a></cite> prohibited any person or business entity from engaging in the sale of real estate without proper licensure.

       Person Who Purchases or Leases Land for His Own Account.
   
   - Although this Chapter does not expressly exempt from its provisions one who purchases or leases land for his own account, it defines "real estate broker" as a person who does these specified acts "for others." McArver v. Gerukos, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 413</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 277 (1965).

       Where plaintiffs allege a contract to buy real estate on their own account under the terms of the listing agreement made by owner with defendant-broker and to share in the sales commission with defendant, and plaintiffs were not engaging in brokerage activities "for others" but were acting for themselves in buying the land and in reducing the purchase price through the commission sharing agreement with defendant, plaintiff 's agreement does not violate the licensing statute and it is enforceable.

       This Chapter does not forbid a licensed real estate broker to embark with an unlicensed person upon a joint venture
   
   in which all of the unlicensed party's activities will be such as are not within the contemplation of this Chapter nor does this Chapter forbid them to agree that they will share all of the receipts from the activities of both of them. Such a contract, when enforced as made, does not violate the policy declared by the legislature in this Chapter. McArver v. Gerukos, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 413</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 277 (1965).

       A contract by one who is not a licensed real estate broker or salesperson with another person to buy land, or an option thereon, for their own account and, thereafter to resell such land, or option, and divide the profits would not be a contract to do an act prohibited by this Chapter.

The Commission may, by rule, establish a schedule for completion of the prescribed postlicensing education that requires provisional brokers to complete portions of the 90-hour postlicensing education program in less than three years, and provisional brokers must comply with this schedule in order to be entitled to actively engage in real estate brokerage. Upon completion of the postlicensing education program, the provisional status of the broker's license shall be terminated.

       Requisite Character and Integrity.
   
   - The Real Estate Commission properly concluded as a matter of law that an applicant for licensure as a real estate salesperson lacked the requisite integrity, where he had been convicted of soliciting a crime against nature, and the applicant's failure to be a law abiding citizen was relevant to determine if he possessed the requisite character and integrity.

      <p>
       Constitutionality.
   
   - Subdivision (a)(8) of this section, as it read prior to the 1983 amendment, was not unconstitutionally vague, nor did it lack the necessary explicitness to put reasonable persons on notice as to the conduct proscribed. Correll v. Boulware, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 631, 329 S.E.2d 695 (1985).

       Strict Construction.
   
   - This section is penal in nature, is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed. North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd. v. Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 219 S.E.2d 271, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 731</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 621 (1975).

      </p>
      <p>
       Section Is Penal.
   
   - The portion of this section which empowers the Board to revoke the license of a real estate broker or salesperson is penal in its nature and should not be construed to include anything as a ground for revocation which is not embraced within its terms. In re Dillingham, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 684</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 584 (1962); Parrish v. North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C.

      <p>
       Insufficient Notice of Charges.
   
   - Notice to the respondent that he was charged with violating subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(4), and (a)(10) of this section did not adequately apprise the respondent of the charges against him so as to enable him to prepare his defense, where he was subsequently found guilty of violating subdivision (a)(8) of this section.

        Subdivision (a)(4) Not to Be Initially Applied by Federal Court.
       </b>
       - The General Assembly did not intend subdivision (a)(4) of this section to be initially applied by a federal court, although both federal and state courts may review Commission actions under subdivision (a)(4) after such actions are concluded. John v. Robbins, 764 F. Supp. 379 (M.D.N.C. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section allows the Board to revoke or suspend a license for any one of several listed misdeeds.
   
   Only one violation is needed to revoke or suspend one's license, and one act may constitute a violation of more than one subsection of this section. Correll v. Boulware, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 631, 329 S.E.2d 695 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Activities Need Not Be Related to Brokering or Selling.
   
   - For case holding that the fact that by subsequent amendment the legislature chose to omit the words "any of the acts mentioned herein" from the introductory language of subsection (a), on which the court in In re Dillingham, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 684</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 584 (1962) relied, shows the clear intent to omit the requirement that the activities giving rise to a suspension or revocation must be directly related to real estate brokering or selling, see Watson v. North Carolina Real Estate Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 362 S.E.2d 294 (1987), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 746</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 296 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Suspension or Revocation for Activities Not Directly Related to Brokering or Selling.
   
   - The subsequent amendment of this section evidences the legislature's clear intent to remove the requirements placed on the earlier version of the statute by In re Dillingham, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 684</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 584 (1962), that the activities giving rise to a suspension or revocation must be directly related to real estate brokering or selling. Therefore, the Commission could find real estate broker knowingly permitted the use of altered tapes in his Commission hearing, violating subdivision (a)(8) and (a)(10) of this section. Watson v. North Carolina Real Estate Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 362 S.E.2d 294 (1987), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 746</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 296 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the specific provision provides otherwise, the Commission may suspend or revoke a license issued pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t93Aa01s93A-4" target="_self">G.S. 93A-4</a></cite> for any of the acts enumerated in subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(12) of this section, without regard to whether the acts were connected in any way with the pursuit of the licensed privilege of a real estate broker or salesperson. Watson v. North Carolina Real Estate Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 362 S.E.2d 294 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Dishonesty of Licensee as Owner.
   
   - The licensing act should not be interpreted to require a licensee to be honest as a broker or salesperson while allowing him to be dishonest as an owner. North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd. v. Gallman, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 277 S.E.2d 853 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Licensed real estate broker who was selling a residential property the broker owned did not become the buyers' fiduciary and have any heightened duty of disclosure by virtue of being both a broker and self-represented seller in the transaction. Stevens v. Heller, - N.C. App.
   - , 836 S.E.2d 675 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       This Chapter is not concerned with a licensed broker's sharing of his commissions with an unlicensed associate,
   
   unless the reason for such sharing is the performance by the unlicensed associate of acts which violate the Chapter. McArver v. Gerukos, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 413</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 277 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Filing a false and fraudulent income tax return,
   
   either individually or jointly, is not an offense similar to conspiracy to defraud, in which latter offense the unlawful agreement is the gist of the offense, nor is it similar to embezzlement, obtaining money under false pretenses, or forgery within the meaning of this section. North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd. v. Coe, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 198 S.E.2d 19 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Incompetence to Act as Broker or Salesperson.
   
   - Subdivision (a)(8) of this section requires findings on issues that are not included in the other subdivisions. Parrish v. North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 254 S.E.2d 268 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (a)(8) as Lesser Included Offense.
   
   - Subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(10) of this section do not raise any issues of respondent's worthiness or competency to act as a real estate agent or broker, or his ability to safeguard the interests of the public. Therefore, the contention that subdivision (a)(8) of this section is a lesser included offense of subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(10) of this section is without merit. Parrish v. North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 254 S.E.2d 268 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding Inadequate to Suspend License.
   
   - Finding by the Real Estate Licensing Board that "there is substantial evidence" that a real estate agent acted in violation of subdivision (a)(8) of this section in certain respects is insufficient to support a suspension of the agent's license since it is necessary for the Board to find that the agent "is deemed guilty of " a violation of the statute before his license can be suspended. North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd. v. Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 219 S.E.2d 271, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 731</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 621 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The finding that respondent on a single occasion failed to obtain an earnest money deposit is insufficient to support the conclusion that he was unworthy and incompetent in violation of subdivision (a)(8) of this section. Parrish v. North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 254 S.E.2d 268 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings that respondent agent made a secret profit
   
   of $8,000, after the payment of expenses, by purchasing property and reselling it to third party and by failing to disclose to third party his purchase price of the property, and by failing to disclose to the sellers his selling price, and that he received $18,720.44 from third party but paid only $10,858.72 to bank on his loan on the property, causing loss to third party, supported the conclusion that respondent violated this section. Correll v. Boulware, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 631, 329 S.E.2d 695 (1985).

      <p>
       Sale of Broker's Own Notes Secured by Deeds of Trust.
   
   - A real estate broker, in selling his own notes secured by deeds of trust, did not act as a real estate broker as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t93Aa01s93A-2" target="_self">G.S. 93A-2</a></cite>, and any misconduct in performing such acts did not warrant the Board or the court on appeal to revoke his license on such ground under former version of this section. In re Dillingham, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 684</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 584 (1962). But see, Watson v. North Carolina Real Estate Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C.

      <p>
       Keeping Disorderly House.
   
   - Evidence offered by the Board to the effect that a real estate broker had pleaded guilty to a charge of operating a disorderly house shows acts of a vile and decadent character committed by him, but such acts are not connected in any way with the pursuit of his licensed privilege as a real estate broker, and are not a ground for revocation of his license, and such evidence was correctly excluded as irrelevant and immaterial under former version of this section. In re Dillingham, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 684</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 584 (1962). But see, Watson v. North Carolina Real Estate Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C.

       Failure to Check Federal Flood Hazard Maps.
   
   - Because mere inaction does not constitute negligence in the absence of a duty to act and real estate agent was under no duty to search the federal flood hazard maps, the fact that she did not search these maps, discover that the property was located in a flood plain, and inform plaintiffs could not constitute a negligent omission under subdivision (a)(1).

       There is hereby created a special fund to be known as the 'Real Estate Education and Recovery Fund' which shall be set aside and maintained by the North Carolina Real Estate Commission. The fund shall be used in the manner provided under this Article for the payment of unsatisfied judgments where the aggrieved person has suffered a direct monetary loss by reason of certain acts committed by any real estate broker. The Commission may also expend money from the fund to create books and other publications, courses, forms, seminars, and other programs and materials to educate licensees and the public in real estate subjects. However, the Commission shall make no expenditures from the fund for educational purposes if the expenditure will reduce the balance of the fund to an amount less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000).

      <li id="t93Aa02s93A-16ol1b">
       On September 1, 1979, the Commission shall transfer the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) from its expense reserve fund to the Real Estate Education and Recovery Fund. Thereafter, the Commission may transfer to the Real Estate Education and Recovery Fund additional sums of money from whatever funds the Commission may have, provided that, if on December 31 of any year the amount remaining in the fund is less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the Commission may determine that each person or entity licensed under this Chapter, when renewing a license, shall pay in addition to the license renewal fee, a fee not to exceed ten dollars ($10.00) per broker  as shall be determined by the Commission for the purpose of replenishing the fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t93Aa02s93A-16ol1c">
       The Commission shall invest and reinvest the monies in the Real Estate Education and Recovery Fund in the same manner as provided by law for the investment of funds by the clerk of superior court. The proceeds from such investments shall be deposited to the credit of the fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t93Aa02s93A-16ol1d">
       The Commission shall have the authority to adopt rules and procedures not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article, to provide for the orderly, fair and efficient administration and payment of monies held in the Real Estate Education and Recovery Fund.

The developer shall, when making application for renewal, also provide a copy of the report required in G.S. 93A-48. Each certificate reinstated after the expiration date thereof shall be subject to a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) in addition to the required renewal fee. In the event a time share developer fails to reinstate the registration within 12 months after the expiration date thereof, the Commission may, in its discretion, consider the time share project as not having been previously registered, and thereby subject to the provisions of this Article relating to the issuance of an original certificate.

The Commission shall within 15 days after receipt of an incomplete application, notify the developer by mail that the Commission has found specified deficiencies, and shall, within 45 days after the receipt of a properly completed application, either issue the certificate of registration or notify the developer by mail of any specific objections to the registration of the project. The certificate shall be prominently displayed in the office of the developer on the site of the project.

In the event a developer disposes of, or otherwise terminates its interest in a time share project, the developer shall certify to the Commission in writing that its interest in the time share project is terminated and shall return to the Commission for cancellation the certificate of registration.

Session Laws 1993, c. 419, s. 7 repealed Article 5 effective July 1, 1994. Section 6 of Session Laws 1993, c. 419, also effective July 1, 1994, enacted the North Carolina Appraisers Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.093E.html#t93Ea01s93E-1-1" target="_blank">G.S. 93E-1-1</a></cite> et seq., which created the North Carolina Appraisal Board as an independent body.

        CASE NOTES
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Authority for Preparation of Expert Report.
   
   - Trial court erroneously invoked subsection (f) to exclude a licensed real estate broker's expert testimony because the broker did not prepare his expert report under the authority of Article 6 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.093A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 93A</a></cite>, but relied on the authority that N.C. R. Evid. 702 purportedly gave him instead; thus, the broker's preparation of the expert report did not violate the second sentence of subsection (f). N.C. DOT v. Mission Battleground Park, DST, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 477</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 217 (2018).
