   </h3>
   <p>
    All public officers shall receive the fees prescribed for them respectively, from the persons for whom, or at whose instance, the service shall be performed, except persons suing as paupers, and no officer shall be compelled to perform any service, unless his fee be paid or tendered, except in criminal actions. The said officers shall receive no extra allowance or other compensation whatever, unless the same shall be expressly authorized by statute. In case the service shall be ordered by any proper officer of the State, or of a county, for the benefit of the State or county, the fees need not be paid in advance; but if for the State, shall be paid by the State, as other claims against it are; if for a county, by the board of commissioners, out of the county funds. The fees in criminal cases are not demandable in advance.

   - This section and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Xa28s1-305" target="_blank">G.S. 1-305</a></cite>, providing that clerks shall issue execution on all judgments rendered in their respective courts within six weeks of the rendition thereof or be amerced in the sum of $100.00, must be construed together; hence, a clerk of the superior court will not incur the penalty prescribed in G.S. 1-305 unless the plaintiff pays or tenders him his fees for that service. Bank of Oxford v. Bobbitt, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 194</cite>, 16 S.E. 169 (1892).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Officers of Court Must Demand Fees.
   
   - Officers of the courts are not compelled to perform their duties unless the fees prescribed by law are paid or tendered them, but they must demand them before laches can be imputed to the litigants. West v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 333</cite> (1886).
   </p>
   <p>
    An officer is not "compelled to perform" the required service, but he may perform it and dispense with payment therefor, and if he does not so intend, he should say so at the time, and should not presume that the posting of the notice in his office of an inflexible rule that he had adopted and from which he would not under any circumstances depart would be known to everyone. West v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 333</cite> (1886).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Right of Superior Court Clerk to Demand Fees in Advance.
   
   - The clerk had the right, even under the common law, as he has under the statute, to demand his fees in advance. Clerk v. Wagoner, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. 131</cite> (1843); Martin v. Chesteen, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 96</cite> (1876); Andrews v. Whisnant, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 446</cite> (1880); West v.

Gay, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 544</cite>, 13 S.E. 207 (1891).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    In criminal actions, superior court clerk cannot require costs of transcript upon appeal to be paid in advance,
   
   even where defendant does not appeal in forma pauperis, and a certiorari will issue directing the clerk to send up the transcript which he holds for such prepayment. State v. Nash, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 822</cite>, 13 S.E. 733 (1891).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Refusal of Supreme Court Clerk to Docket Transcript Where Fee Not Paid.
   
   - The appellant's undertaking does not cover the fee of the clerk of the Supreme Court in docketing the case, and the clerk is in the exercise of his right in refusing to docket the transcript where he has demanded the prescribed fee in advance and its payment has been refused. Dunn v. Clerk's Office, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 50</cite>, 96 S.E. 738 (1918).

    Right of Register to Refuse Registration of Mortgage until Fees Paid.

   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Effect of Unconditional Pardon on Fees Due Officers of Court.
   
   - Fees due officers of the court are rights vested by law, and are not discharged when a defendant receives an unconditional pardon, after conviction and sentence, from the Governor of the State. State v. Mooney, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 98</cite> (1876).
   </p>
   <p>
    Where a pardon is pleaded after verdict and before judgment, it will discharge defendant from the costs. State v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 599</cite> (1870); State v. Mooney, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 98</cite> (1876).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Recovery of Improperly Collected Fees.
   
   - Where a person is compelled to pay a public officer fees which he had no right to claim in order to induce him to do his duty, such fees may be recovered back. Robinson v. Ezzell, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 231</cite> (1875).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Power of Legislature to Reduce or Increase Salaries of Officers.
   
   - The legislature may reduce or increase the salaries of such officers as are not protected by the Constitution during their term of office. Cotten v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 545</cite> (1860).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Taxation of Salary.
   
   - It was formerly held that the State could not tax the salary of a state officer whose office was created by the Constitution. Purnell v. Page, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 125</cite>, 45 S.E. 534 (1903).

   <p>
    The salaries of all State administrative officers not subject to the North Carolina Human Resources Act shall be set by the Governor, unless a law provides otherwise.

    Whenever by law it is provided that a salary shall be fixed or set by the General Assembly in the Current Operations Appropriations Act, and that office or position is filled by appointment of the Governor, or the appointment is subject to the approval of the Governor, or is made by a commission a majority of whose members are appointed by the Governor, then the Governor may, increase or decrease the salary of a new appointee by a maximum of ten percent (10%) over or under the salary of that position as provided in the Current Operations Appropriations Act, such increased or decreased salary to remain in effect until changed by the General Assembly or until the end of the fiscal year, whichever occurs first. The Governor under this paragraph may not increase the salary of any nonelected official above the level set in the Current Operations Appropriations Act for any member of the Council of State. This section does not apply to any office filled by election by the people, and does not apply to any office in the legislative or judicial branches.
   </p>
   <p>
    Officials whose salaries are covered by the provisions of this section shall be eligible for longevity pay on the same basis as is provided to employees of the State who are subject to the State Personnel Act.
