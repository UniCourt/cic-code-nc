                        Constitutionality. - This Article is a constitutional exercise of a legislative power. Wells v. Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 744</cite>, 197 S.E. 693 (1938).

                        A housing authority created under this Article is not invested with legislative and supreme judicial powers, and therefore its creation does not violate the constitutional provision that such powers be and remain separate and distinct. Cox v. Kinston,

                        Purpose of Article. - The State cannot enact laws, and cities and towns cannot pass effective ordinances, forbidding disease, vice and crime to enter into the slums of overcrowded areas, there defeating every purpose for which civilized government exists
                        and spreading influences detrimental to law and order; but experience has shown that this result can be more effectively brought about by the removal of physical surroundings conducive to these conditions. This is the objective
                        of this Article and the means by which it is intended to accomplish it. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).

                        Slum Clearance as Public Purpose. - "Slum clearance" to rehabilitate crowded and congested areas in cities and towns where conditions conducive to disease and public disorder exist is a public purpose, for which the legislature may create municipal corporations,
                        and housing authorities established under this and the following sections are for such governmental purpose. Wells v. Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 744</cite>, 197 S.E. 693 (1938); In re
                        Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 649</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 761 (1951).

                    <p>

                        A housing authority organized under this Article is created for a public purpose and exercises an essential governmental function. Briefly stated, its public purpose is the elimination or rehabilitation of unsafe and unsanitary dwelling units in crowded
                        and congested areas and the construction of housing projects to provide safe and sanitary dwelling units for rental to persons of low income. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>,

        Hearing Requirements Before Eviction.
       </b> - Hearing to be afforded tenants of public housing before determination to evict them requires: (1) timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for a proposed termination, (2) an opportunity on the part of the
                        tenant to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, (3) the right of a tenant to be represented by counsel, provided by him to delineate the issues, present the factual contentions in an orderly manner, conduct cross-examination
                        and generally to safeguard his interests, (4) a decision, based on evidence adduced at the hearing, in which the reasons for decision and the evidence relied on are set forth, and (5) an impartial decision maker. Caulder v. Durham

                        The public duty doctrine did not apply to the defendant Housing Authority because it was properly classified as a local government agency, despite its existence as a municipal corporation, for the following reasons: Pursuant to

                            the Housing Authorities Law which creates the North Carolina Indian Housing Authority states: "It is the intent of the General Assembly that the North Carolina Indian Housing Authority not be treated as a State agency for any
                            purpose, but rather that it be treated as a housing authority as set out above." Huntley v. Pandya, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 624, 534 S.E.2d 238, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 263</cite>, 546

                        Housing authority provided a governmental function and was entitled to rely on doctrine of governmental immunity as it related to a personal injury suit brought against it;

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa21s160A-485ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-485(a)</a></cite> did not control whether or not the housing authority had legal capacity to waive its immunity by buying
                        insurance, but authority could have accepted liability to the extent of insurance purchased, and the case was therefore remanded since the appellate court was unable to discern whether the trial court's denial of the housing authority's
                        motion to dismiss was premised upon the housing authority's insurance coverage. Evans v. Hous. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 50</cite>, 602 S.E.2d 668 (2004).

                        It is hereby declared that unsanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations exist in urban and rural areas throughout the State and that such unsafe or unsanitary conditions arise from overcrowding and concentration of population, the obsolete and poor condition

                        Eviction of Tenant for Failure to Pay Rent. - In order to evict a tenant occupying public housing for persons with low incomes for failure to pay rent as called for in the lease, there must be a finding of fault on the part of the tenant in failing to
                        make the rental payment. Upon a showing by the Authority that the rental payment has not been made as required by the lease, it is presumed that the failure to pay the rent is good cause for eviction. The burden there-upon shifts
                        to the tenant to produce evidence to prove a lack of fault on his part in failing to make the rental payment. Maxton Hous. Auth. v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 277</cite>, 328 S.E.2d 290 (1985).

                        Good cause was not shown for termination of lease, where Authority proved the failure of tenant to make rental payments and water and sewer payment, thus raising a presumption that good cause existed to terminate the lease, but by uncontroverted evidence
                        rebutted the presumption by proving the lack of fault on her part in failing to make these payments, showing that initially, no rent was required of tenant and her two children, that the rent in question was based upon the income
                        of husband when he moved into the apartment after marrying defendant, that tenant still had no income herself, and that husband refused to pay the rent and then lost his job. Maxton Hous. Auth. v. McLean,

                    them to be the officers as asserted in the application, and that each subscribed and swore thereto in the officer's presence. The Secretary of State shall examine the application and if he finds that the name proposed for the corporation
                    is not identical with that of a person or of any other corporation of this State or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion and uncertainty he shall receive and file it and shall record it in an appropriate book of record in his

                <p>
                    When the application has been made, filed and recorded, as herein provided, the authority shall constitute a public body and a body corporate and politic under the name proposed in the application; the Secretary of State shall make and issue to the said
                    commissioners a certificate of incorporation pursuant to this Article, under the seal of the State, and shall record the same with the application.

                    If the council, after a hearing as aforesaid, shall determine that neither of the above enumerated conditions exist, it shall adopt a resolution denying the petition. After three months shall have expired from the date of the denial of any such petitions,
                    subsequent petitions may be filed as aforesaid and new hearings and determinations made thereon.

                    In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have been established in accordance with the provisions of this Article upon proof of
                    the issuance of the aforesaid certificate by the Secretary of State. A copy of such certificate, duly certified by the Secretary of State, shall be admissible in evidence in any such suit, action or proceeding, and shall be conclusive
                    proof of the filing and contents thereof.

                <p>
                    The Secretary of State is authorized and empowered to revoke or to cancel a certificate of incorporation previously issued to an authority or housing authority upon filing in his office a petition and resolution of the council and a petition and resolution
                    of the authority and its members requesting such revocation or cancellation and when the Secretary of State is satisfied that no indebtedness has been incurred or property acquired by said housing authority.

                        Justification for Housing Authority to Be Determined by Municipality. - Existence or nonexistence of facts within its corporate limits justifying the creation of a housing authority is for the determination of the municipal corporation, which duty is
                        political and not judicial, and in proceedings to enjoin the activities of a housing authority the court does not have authority to hear evidence in regard to the existence of the facts upon which the creation of the housing authority
                        was predicated. Cox v. Kinston, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 391</cite>, 8 S.E.2d 252 (1940).

                        for the creation of a housing authority to perform a proper municipal governmental function within its limits is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Cox v. Kinston, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 391</cite>,

                    The bonds of the authority shall be authorized by its resolution and shall be issued in one or more series and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding 60 years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate
                    or rates, be in such denominations (which may be made interchangeable), be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place
                    or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption (with or without premium) as such resolution or its trust indenture or mortgage may provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bonds may be sold at public or private sale; provided, however, that no public sale shall be held unless notice thereof is published once at least 10 days prior to such sale in a newspaper having a general circulation in the city in which the authority
                    is located and in a financial newspaper published in the City of New York, New York, or in the City of Chicago, Illinois. The bonds may be sold at such price or prices as the authority shall determine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pending the authorization, preparation, execution or delivery of definitive bonds, the authority may issue interim certificates, or other temporary obligations, to the purchaser of such bonds. Such interim certificates, or other temporary obligations,
                    shall be in such form, contain such terms, conditions and provisions, bear such date or dates, and evidence such agreements relating to their discharge or payment or the delivery of definitive bonds as the authority may by resolution,
                    trust indenture or mortgage determine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case any of the officers whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officers before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if they had remained
                    in office until such delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The authority shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase any bonds issued by it at a price not more than the principal amount thereof and the accrued interest; provided, however, that bonds payable exclusively from the revenues of
                    a designated project or projects shall be purchased out of any such revenues available therefor. All funds so purchased shall be cancelled. This paragraph shall not apply to the redemption of bonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds, interim certificates, or other obligations issued pursuant to this Article shall be fully negotiable.

                    An authority is a local government agency and is exempt from taxation to the same extent as a unit of local government. Property owned by an authority is exempt from taxation in accordance with Article V, § 2 of the North Carolina Constitution. Bonds
                    and other obligations issued by an authority or its corporate agent authorized by this Article to exercise its powers are declared to be issued for a public purpose and to be public instrumentalities. These obligations are exempt from
                    all State, county, and municipal taxation or assessment, direct or indirect, general or special, whether imposed for the purpose of general revenue or otherwise, excluding income taxes on the gain from the transfer of the obligations,
                    and franchise taxes. The interest on the obligations is not subject to taxation as income.

                    No governing body of a city or other municipality shall adopt a resolution as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t157a01s157-39.1" target="_self">G.S. 157-39.1</a></cite> declaring that there is a need for a housing authority
                    (other than a housing authority established by such municipality) to exercise its powers within such municipality, unless a public hearing has first been held by such governing body and unless such governing body shall have found in
                    substantially the following terms: (i) that insanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations exist in such municipality or that there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in such municipality available to
                    persons of low income at rentals they can afford; and (ii) that these conditions can be best remedied through the exercise of the aforesaid housing authority's powers within the territorial boundaries of such municipality: Provided,
                    that such findings shall not have the effect of thereafter preventing such municipality from establishing a housing authority or joining in the creation of a consolidated housing authority or the increase of the area of operation of
                    a consolidated housing authority. The clerk (or the officer with similar duties) of the city or other municipality shall give notice of the public hearing and such hearing shall be held in the manner provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t157a01s157-4" target="_self">G.S. 157-4</a></cite>                    for a public hearing by a council to determine the need for a housing authority in the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the time that, pursuant to these findings, a housing authority has outstanding (or is under contract to issue) any evidences of indebtedness for a project within the city or other municipality, no other housing authority may undertake a project
                    within such municipality without the consent of said housing authority which has such outstanding indebtedness or obligation.

                        Discretion of Housing Authority in Selection of Site. - In determining what property is necessary for a public housing site, a broad discretion is vested by statute in housing authority commissioners, to whom the power of eminent domain is delegated.

                        Selection of Slum Area Site Not Required. - In the selection of a location for a housing project as authorized under the Housing Authorities Law, the project may be built either in a slum area which has been cleared or upon other suitable site. The housing
                        authority is given wide discretion in the selection and location of a site for such project. In re Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 649</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 761 (1951); Philbrook v. Chapel Hill

                        A housing authority has wide discretion in the selection and location of a site for a housing project. It is not required to select a site in a slum area as the site for a low-rent housing project. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp.,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).

                        Fact that a few isolated properties in an area may be taken and dismantled which are above the standard of slum properties, or that some few desirable homes will be taken, will not affect the public character of the condemnation proceeding. In re Housing

                        When Judicial Review of Authority's Site Selection Is Available. - So extensive is the discretionary power of the housing commissioners that ordinarily the selection of a project site may only become an issuable question, determinable by the court, on
                        allegations charging arbitrary or capricious conduct amounting to an abuse of discretion. However, allegations charging malice, fraud, or bad faith in the selection of a housing project site are not essential to confer the right
                        of judicial review. It suffices to allege and show abuse of discretion. In re Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 463</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 500 (1952); Philbrook v. Chapel Hill Hous. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 598</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Testimony tending to show that other sites were available and suitable for a housing project is relevant and admissible as bearing directly on the question of whether the housing commissioners acted arbitrarily or capriciously in attempting to appropriate
                        the proposed site. In re Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 463</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 500 (1952).

                <p>
                    It is hereby found and declared that the National Defense Program involves large increases in the military forces and personnel in this State, a great increase in the number of workers in already established manufacturing centers and the bringing of a
                    large number of workers and their families to new centers of defense industries in the State; that there is an acute shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings available to such persons and their families in this State which impedes the
                    National Defense Program; that it is imperative that action be taken immediately to assure the availability of safe and sanitary dwellings for such persons to enable the rapid expansion of national defense activities in this State
                    and to avoid a large labor turnover in defense industries which would seriously hamper their production; that the provisions hereinafter enacted are necessary to assure the availability of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons engaged
                    in national defense activities which otherwise would not be provided at this time, and that such provisions are for the public use and purpose of facilitating the National Defense Program in this State. It is further declared to be
                    the purpose of this Article to authorize housing authorities to do any and all things necessary or desirable to secure the financial aid of the federal government, or to cooperate with or act as agent of the federal government, in
                    the expeditious development and the administration of projects to assure the availability when needed of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons engaged in national defense activities.
