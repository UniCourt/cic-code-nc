      <p>
       "Fiduciary Relationship."
   
   - A fiduciary relationship exists where there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and in due regard to the one reposing confidence. Moore v. Bryson, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 181 S.E.2d 113 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary that there be a technical or legal relationship for a fiduciary relationship to exist. Moore v. Bryson, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 181 S.E.2d 113 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       If as an executor, as a cotenant or simply as an individual, a person undertook to manage and generally control a tract of land for the benefit of his co-owners, causing them to repose special faith, confidence and trust in him to represent their best interest with respect to the property, he occupied a fiduciary relationship to them. Moore v. Bryson, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 181 S.E.2d 113 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a fiduciary relationship ordinarily does not arise between tenants in common from the simple fact of their cotenancy, such a relationship may be created by their conduct, as where one cotenant assumes to act for the benefit of his cotenants. Moore v. Bryson, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 181 S.E.2d 113 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Fiduciaries must act in good faith.
   
   They can never paramount their personal interest over the interest of those for whom they have assumed to act. Moore v. Bryson, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 181 S.E.2d 113 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Interests May Not Conflict.
   
   - A person occupying a place of trust and confidence may not place himself in a position where his own interest may conflict with the interest of those for whom he acts. Moore v. Bryson, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 181 S.E.2d 113 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A fiduciary who acquires an outstanding title adverse to his cestuis que trustent
   
   is considered in equity as having acquired it for their benefit. Moore v. Bryson, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 181 S.E.2d 113 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An executor acts in a fiduciary capacity.
   
   Moore v. Bryson, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 181 S.E.2d 113 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Good Faith."
   
   - By defining "good faith" in subsection (b) of this section in terms of an act done honestly although perhaps negligently, the drafters of the act implicitly revealed their intention that the term "bad faith" requires a showing of some indicia of dishonest conduct or a showing of facts and circumstances so cogent and obvious that to remain passive would amount to a deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a belief or fear that inquiry would disclose a defect in the transaction. Edwards v. Northwestern Bank, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 261, 250 S.E.2d 651 (1979), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 281 S.E.2d 86 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable Care Demonstrated by Fiduciary.
   
   - Because a bank, which was the trustee of a trust, demonstrated reasonable care by taking precautionary steps to protect the retained funds and investing the funds in a liquid and risk-free money market account until the pending litigation was resolved, there was no breach of fiduciary duty under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32a01s32-2" target="_self">G.S. 32-2</a></cite>. Heinitsh v. Wachovia Bank, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 665 S.E.2d 541 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 125</cite>, 673 S.E.2d 131 (2009).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability of Executor.
   
   - An executor, in performing those duties related to managing the estate's assets, acts as a trustee to beneficiaries of the estate. As such, the executor is liable for the depreciation of assets which an ordinarily prudent fiduciary would not have allowed to occur. Fortune v. First Union Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 359 S.E.2d 801 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 146</cite>, 371 S.E.2d 483 (1988).

     <p>
      A person who in good faith pays or transfers to a fiduciary any money or other property, which the fiduciary as such is authorized to receive, is not responsible for the proper application thereof by the fiduciary; and any right or title acquired from the fiduciary in consideration of such payment or transfer is not invalid in consequence of a misapplication by the fiduciary.

     <p>
      If any negotiable instrument payable or indorsed to a fiduciary as such is indorsed by a fiduciary, or if any negotiable instrument payable or indorsed to his principal is indorsed by a fiduciary empowered to indorse such instrument on behalf of his principal, the indorsee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in indorsing or delivering the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary unless he takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith. If, however, such instrument is transferred by the fiduciary in payment of or as security for a personal debt of the fiduciary to the actual knowledge of the creditor, or is transferred in any transaction known by the transferee to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, the creditor or other transferee is liable to the principal if the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in transferring the instrument.

      If a check or other bill of exchange is drawn by a fiduciary as such, or in the name of his principal by a fiduciary empowered to draw such instrument in the name of his principal, the payee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary unless he takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.

        Section Illustrates General Rule of Liability.
       </b>
       - The history of this provision indicates that it was intended to illustrate the general rule of liability rather than to create an exception to it. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).

      <p>
       <b>
        Payee's Liability.
       </b>
       - For the payee to become liable under this section it must be found either that it had actual knowledge of the misappropriation or that it acted in bad faith. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Contributory Negligence of Principal.
       </b>
       - Liability is based on payee's conscious conduct or "bad faith" and contributory neglect of principal would not negate such fault. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Test for Determining Bad Faith.
       </b>
       - In determining "bad faith" courts ask whether it was "commercially" unjustifiable for the payee to disregard and refuse to learn facts readily available. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Bad faith in taking commercial paper does not necessarily involve furtive motives,

       for it exists when the creditor has notice of facts which, if unexplained, would show that he was taking the property of one who owed him nothing, in payment of a claim that he held against someone else. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When Remaining Passive Is Bad Faith.
       </b>
       - At some point, obvious circumstances become so cogent that it is "bad faith" to remain passive. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).

       <b>
        Agreement Protecting Bank Void When Bank Acts in Bad Faith.
       </b>
       - Any agreement protecting a bank from liability for assisting a fiduciary in a misappropriation when the bank acts in "bad faith" or with "actual knowledge" of the fiduciary's breach is void. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Fact That Bank Is Designated Payee Not Enough to Attribute "Actual Knowledge" or "Bad Faith."
       </b>
       - The bank is not liable for cashing the first check in the series and paying the proceeds to the fiduciary, since the mere fact that the bank was designated as payee was not enough to attribute to it either "actual knowledge" or "bad faith," but it did act in "bad faith," even if it lacked "actual knowledge," when it received the second check in the series and credited the proceeds to the fiduciary's debt. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>

        The crediting of checks to fiduciary's private debts constitutes either "actual knowledge" or "bad faith."

      </p>
      <p>
       While a bank may have acted innocently in cashing a first check, it lost this innocence when a second check was received and used to pay fiduciary's personal obligation. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       A bank, having gained "actual knowledge" of a breach of a fiduciary obligation when it received a second check in series and applied it in reduction of fiduciary's personal debt, could not divest itself of its continuing knowledge of the faithlessness of the fiduciary. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Creditor's Liability for "Actual Knowledge."
       </b>
       - If the crediting of checks to fiduciary's private debts constitutes "actual knowledge," the creditor is liable because from the circumstances it would necessarily have "actual knowledge" that the fiduciary was misappropriating his principal's funds. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Bank of Charlotte, 340 F.2d 550 (4th Cir. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Sufficient for Jury.
   
   - Admissions by defendant that it entered into contracts for the sale of certain lands to an individual and that in payment of the sum due upon the execution of the contracts it accepted checks drawn on the funds of a corporation by the individual as president of the corporation, together with evidence that the individual had no authority to so use the corporate funds, that the corporation was not indebted to him, and that the transaction was not made for the corporation, was sufficient to be submitted to the jury in an action by the receiver of the corporation under the provisions of this section.

      <p>
       Distinction Between Negligence and Bad Faith.
   
   - The distinction between negligence and bad faith is that bad faith, or dishonesty, unlike negligence, is willful. Edwards v. Northwestern Bank, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 261, 250 S.E.2d 651 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Showing of mere negligence is clearly not sufficient to establish "bad faith."
   
   Edwards v. Northwestern Bank, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 261, 250 S.E.2d 651 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere failure to make inquiry,
   
   even though there be suspicious circumstances, does not constitute bad faith, unless such failure is due to the deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a belief or fear that inquiry would disclose a vice or defect in the transaction - that is to say, where there is an intentional closing of the eyes or stopping of the ears. Edwards v. Northwestern Bank, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 261, 250 S.E.2d 651 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Constitutes "Bad Faith."
   
   - By defining "good faith" in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32a01s32-2ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 32-2(b)</a></cite> in terms of an act done honestly although perhaps negligently, the drafters of the act implicitly revealed their intention that the term "bad faith" requires a showing of some indicia of dishonest conduct or a showing of facts and circumstances so cogent and obvious that to remain passive would amount to a deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a belief or fear that inquiry would disclose a defect in the transaction. Edwards v. Northwestern Bank, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 261, 250 S.E.2d 651 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank's violation of this section of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act was held not to constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice where the breach of fiduciary duty was committed by a trustee, and there was an absence of actual knowledge or bad faith by the bank. Moretz v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 486 S.E.2d 85 (1997).

       Statute Inapplicable.
   
   - When sellers sued a bank regarding the fraudulent scheme of the bank's customer, the sellers' claim under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32a01s32-9" target="_self">G.S. 32-9</a></cite> failed because (1) the statute applied to a fiduciary's fraudulent withdrawals on a principal's account, but (2) the bank's account was not in the sellers' names.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Sale of Real Property Devised to Testator's Son.
   
   - Where a will granted the executor all of the power set forth in this section, neither the will nor this section gave the executor the authority to sell real property devised to the testator's minor son without prior court approval, since the title to the real property vested in the devisee son upon the testator's death, and the executor did not "hold" the property and it was not "at his disposal" within the meaning of this section. Montgomery v. Hinton, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 271, 262 S.E.2d 697 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Power of Executor.
   
   - As the executor had the sole power to settle claims, plaintiff had no right under the deed of separation, the escrow agreement, or the buy-sell agreement to challenge the purchase price of stock. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 500, 459 S.E.2d 58 (1995).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney-Client Privilege
   
   - Deceased client's widow, who was also the executrix of his estate, and who was granted all the powers contained in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32a03s32-27" target="_self">G.S. 32-27</a></cite>, had no authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32a03s32-27" target="_self">G.S. 32-27</a></cite>(23) to waive the client's attorney-client privilege, as there was no existing claim by or against the client's estate, nor did she have such authority under any other provision of G.S. 32-27. In re Investigation of the Death of Miller, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 316</cite>, 584 S.E.2d 772 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Deed of Trust.
   
   - In the determination of whether a deed of trust conveyed by the executor is a debt of the estate, the burden is on the party asserting the validity of the debt as an obligation of the estate to show that the executor acted within his authority as executor. Hunter v. Newsom, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 564, 468 S.E.2d 802 (1996).

       <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32a06s32-53" target="_self">G.S. 32-53(4)</a></cite> provides that Article 6 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.032.html" target="_blank">Chapter 32</a></cite> of the North Carolina General Statutes applies only to trusts as defined in the North Carolina Uniform Trust Code. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32a06s32-53" target="_self">G.S. 32-53(4)</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.036C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 36C</a></cite>, the Uniform Trust Code, expressly excludes from its scope trusts for the primary purpose of paying debts. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.036C.html#t36Ca01s36C-1-102" target="_blank">G.S. 36C-1-102</a></cite>, and the Uniform Trust Code states that the term trustee does not include trustees in mortgages and deeds of trust, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.036C.html#t36Ca01s36C-1-103" target="_blank">G.S. 36C-1-103(22)</a></cite>; therefore, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32a06s32-61" target="_self">G.S. 32-61</a></cite> does not apply to trustee-attorneys in foreclosure proceedings because the legislature intended Article 6 to encompass trustees and other fiduciaries only in the context of trusts subject to the North Carolina Uniform Trust Code.

   - Where attorney placed settlement proceeds in an account and later withdrew money for services which law firm had rendered, attorney did not violate this section by failing to have the legal fee approved by the clerk of superior court since attorney was not serving as the fiduciary or personal representative for the estate but as the attorney for the personal representative; therefore, this section had no applicability to the facts of the case.

       Liability of Executor.
   
   - An executor, in performing those duties related to managing the estate's assets, acts as a trustee to beneficiaries of the estate. As such, the executor is liable for the depreciation of assets which an ordinarily prudent fiduciary would not have allowed to occur. Fortune v. First Union Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C.

       Violation of Standard Shown.
   
   - Trustee violated the prudent man standard by failing to balance the investment of the trust's assets between income and growth investments and by favoring the interests of the life beneficiaries over those of the remaindermen. Pittman v. Barker, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 580, 452 S.E.2d 326, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 261</cite>, 456 S.E.2d 833 (1995).

      <p>
       Reversing an assistant clerk's order removing a guardian of an estate and trustee under a special needs trust for breach of fiduciary duty was error where the appropriate standard of review was whether the assistant clerk committed an error of law, the unchallenged findings of fact showed that the guardian and trustee had spent more than 90 percent of the monies that had been deposited in the trust for purposes for which he received some, if not all, of the benefit, and thus, he was removed based on waste and mismanagement of the assets committed to his care. In re Estate of Skinner, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 126</cite>, 804 S.E.2d 449 (2017).

       A fiduciary holding funds for investment who is specifically directed or authorized by an instrument creating the fiduciary relationship to retain the stock of a bank or trust company that is a member of a bank holding company currently fully registered under an act of Congress entitled Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as the same may be amended from time to time, shall be considered as being directed or authorized to retain the stock of such bank holding company.

      <li id="t32a07s32-72ol1c">
       Whenever a fiduciary holding funds for investment is directed, required, authorized, or permitted by an instrument creating the fiduciary relationship to invest in United States government obligations, the fiduciary may, in the absence of an express prohibition in the instrument, invest in and hold such obligations either directly or in the form of interests in a money market mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. §§ 80a-1, et seq., as from time to time amended, the portfolio of which is limited to United States government obligations and repurchase agreements fully collateralized thereby.

      <li id="t32a07s32-72ol1d">
       The following provisions apply to an instrument creating a fiduciary relationship other than a trust instrument to which Chapter 36C of the General Statutes applies and to a fiduciary other than a trustee:

          <li id="t32a07s32-72ol1d2b">
           If the terms of the instrument confer upon a person the power to consent to certain actions of the fiduciary, and the power holder does not provide consent within a reasonable time after the fiduciary has made a timely request for the power holder's consent, the fiduciary is not liable, individually or as a fiduciary, for any loss resulting directly or indirectly from the fiduciary's failure to take any action that required the power holder's consent.

           The fiduciary has no duty to monitor the conduct of the power holder, provide advice to the power holder, or consult with the power holder. The fiduciary is not required to give notice to any beneficiary of any action taken or not taken by the power holder whether or not the fiduciary agrees with the result. Administrative actions taken by the fiduciary for the purpose of implementing directions of the power holder, including confirming that the directions of the power holder have been carried out, do not constitute monitoring of the power holder or other participation in decisions within the scope of the power holder's authority.
