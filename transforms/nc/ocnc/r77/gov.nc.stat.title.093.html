    Promotion and Sale of Securities Not Covered by Accountant's Liability Coverage.
   
   - While certain "gray areas" exist, particularly with respect to tax law, where the professional services of accountants can become difficult to distinguish from other professional services, transactions which involved the promotion and sale of securities as a profit-making venture unrelated to taxes did not involve the practice of accounting, and insurer who had issued defendants an accountant's professional liability policy was not obligated to defend insureds in damage actions involving such transactions.

   - Former G.S. 7023 of the Consolidated Statutes did not embrace within its terms an isolated instance of the employment of a firm of certified public accountants licensed in another state, who sent their representative to this State to acquire information from the books of a corporation for a statement of its condition to be made out in the state in which the auditing concern was authorized to do business.

    Classification in subdivision (5) is not essentially arbitrary
   
   and without any reasonable basis. The rule has been uniformly applied. It has been uniformly observed by the Board. No discrimination has been shown. Thus, its application does not deny the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the State and federal Constitutions. Duggins v. North Carolina State Bd. of CPA Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 131, 212 S.E.2d 657 (1975), aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 120</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 406 (1978), decided under section as it stood prior to 1977 revision of subdivision.
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    The requirement in subdivision (5) that an applicant for certification have two years' experience
   
   under the tutelage of an accountant engaged in the public practice of accountancy is rationally related to the legislative purpose of ensuring that only an applicant qualified and prepared to enter the public practice by himself be certified. Duggins v. North Carolina State Bd. of CPA Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 120</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 406 (1978), decided under section as it stood prior to 1977 revision of subdivision.
   </p>
   <p>
    To achieve the statutory purpose that only competent and experienced applicants be certified, subdivision (5) must be interpreted as requiring that an applicant's experience not only be received under the supervision of an accountant but that it be in the public field of accountancy. Duggins v. North Carolina State Bd. of CPA Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 120</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 406 (1978), decided under section as it stood prior to 1977 revision of subdivision.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subdivision (5) requires that an applicant for certification who relies upon two years' experience must have worked under a C.P.A. in public practice. Duggins v. North Carolina State Bd. of CPA Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 120</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 406 (1978), decided under section as it stood prior to 1977 revision of subdivision.
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Experience with an attorney-C.P.A.
   
   is not sufficient for certification unless the attorney-C.P.A. is in the "public practice of accountancy" as that phrase is used in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t93s93-1" target="_self">G.S. 93-1(5)</a></cite>. Duggins v. North Carolina State Bd. of CPA Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C.

    Approval of CPA Firm Name Change.
   
   - Certified public accounting firm failed to show that the North Carolina State Board of Certified Public Accountant Examiners erred by denying the accounting firm's proposed name change as the Board had authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t93s93-12" target="_self">G.S. 93-12</a></cite> to regulate name changes, and the Board's decision that the proposed name change had a capacity or tendency to deceive, in violation of N.C.
