                    The policy of the State is to recover and transfer property to rightful owners in a manner that is consistent with the interest of the rightful owners. Where the rightful owner cannot be appropriately determined, it is the policy of the State that all
                    benefits realized from any unclaimed or abandoned property shall accrue to the benefit of higher education for the residents of the State. This Chapter shall be liberally interpreted in a manner that fulfills these purposes.

                        to institute a civil action in the superior court of any county in which such real or personal property is situated, against any administrator, executor, and unknown heirs or unknown claimants as party defendants, which unknown
                        heirs or unknown claimants may be served with summons and notice of such action by publication as is now provided by the laws of this State. If an administrator or executor has been appointed, he shall make a determination that
                        there are no known heirs or unknown claimants and shall inform the State Treasurer of that determination. The superior court in which such civil action is instituted shall have the authority to enter a judgment therein declaring
                        the real and personal property unclaimed as having escheated, and the real property may be sold according to the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.116.html#t116a35s116-291" target="_blank">G.S. 116-2.1</a></cite>                        [G.S. 116B-2.1]. A default final judgment may be entered by the clerk of the superior court in such cases when no answer is filed by the administrator, executor, unknown heirs or unknown claimants to the complaint, or if any answer
                        is filed, the allegations of the complaint are either admitted or not denied by such party defendants, and no claim is made in the answer to the property left by said deceased person. The funds derived from such sale shall be paid
                        into the Escheat Fund where said funds, together with all other escheated funds, shall be held without liability for profit or interest, subject to any just claims therefor.

                        There is a distinction between derelict property and escheated property. An escheat occurs when the property owner dies intestate and without relatives descended from a common parent or grandparent. North Carolina State Treas. v. City of Asheville,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 300 S.E.2d 283 (1983).

                    <p>
                        Unrefunded ticket proceeds is neither abandoned nor derelict property. By purchasing a ticket to a concert, the ticket holder enters into a contract with the auditorium and the performer. If the contract is not performed, he or she may rescind the agreement
                        and demand a refund, but is not compelled to do so. Nor must the auditorium operator or performer refund the purchase price absent a demand. If that were the case, the ticket holder would be unjustly enriched in retaining both
                        money and memento. The auditorium is not a trustee of the unrefunded proceeds of the ticket sale; the auditorium is simply a party to an unperformed contract. North Carolina State Treas. v. City of Asheville,

                    The Treasurer may employ the services of such independent consultants, real estate managers and other persons possessing specialized skills or knowledge as the Treasurer deems necessary or appropriate for the administration of this Chapter, including
                    valuation, maintenance, upkeep, management, sale and conveyance of property and determination of sources of unreported abandoned property. The Treasurer may also employ the services of an attorney to perform a title search or to provide
                    an accurate legal description of real property which the Treasurer has reason to believe may have escheated. Persons whose services are employed by the Treasurer pursuant to this section to determine sources and amounts of unreported
                    property are subject to the same policies, including confidentiality and ethics, as employees of the Department of State Treasurer assigned to determine sources and amounts of unreported property. If the Treasurer contracts with any
                    other person to conduct an audit under this Chapter, the audit shall not be performed on a contingent fee basis or any other similar method that may impair an auditor's independence or the perception of the auditor's independence by
                    the public. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Treasurer may contract with any other person on a contingent fee basis to conduct audits of life insurance companies where the audit is being conducted for the purpose of identifying
                    unclaimed death benefits or to conduct audits of holders of unredeemed bond funds. Compensation of persons whose services may be employed pursuant to this section on a contingent fee basis shall be limited to twelve percent (12%) of
                    the final assessment.

                        Layaway Funds Are Subject to This Chapter. - As long as a customer may get a refund, merely possession of the funds, not ownership, has been ceded. The customer retains an equitable interest in the money. The retention of a legal or an equitable interest
                        in the funds makes the customer the statutory owner of the layaway payments. As a holder, not an owner, the layaway funds within the store's control are subject to the escheat statute. Rose's Stores, Inc. v. Boyles,

                        the savings bond within three years after the savings bond has fully matured. The Treasurer may bring a civil action under this section to take all property rights and legal title and ownership of the savings bond or proceeds from

                        bond escheats to the State of North Carolina. The Treasurer must make sufficient efforts to locate the owner of the savings bond before bringing an action under this section. The Treasurer may not bring an action under this section
                        until a sufficient amount of United States savings bonds have accumulated owing to persons with a last known address of North Carolina to justify the expense of a proceeding under this section. The Treasurer may not bring an action

                        Escheat Officer Not Liable. - Funds representing amounts apportioned to claimants of an insolvent bank who failed to prove their claims, which are turned over to the Secretary of State (now the State Treasurer) as escheat officer, are not assets of the
                        liquidated bank, but are to be held subject solely to the rights of those who failed to prove their claims, and a depositor who proved his claim and received dividends thereon as a common claim may not hold the escheat officer
                        liable for the balance unpaid on his claim upon his contention that the claim should have been paid in full as a preferred claim. Windley v. Lupton, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 167</cite>, 193 S.E. 213

                <p>
                    A record of the issuance of a check, draft, or similar instrument is prima facie evidence of an obligation. In claiming property from a holder who is also the issuer, the Treasurer's burden of proof as to the existence and amount of the property and its
                    abandonment is satisfied by showing issuance of the instrument and passage of the requisite period of abandonment. Defenses of payment, satisfaction, discharge, and want of consideration are affirmative defenses that must be established
                    by the holder. In asserting these affirmative defenses, a holder who is also the issuer may satisfy the holder's burden of proof by showing a written acknowledgement by the payee of a check, draft, or similar instrument that no obligation
                    is owed the payee.

                        Request For Declaratory Ruling Property Denied. - North Carolina Department of State Treasurer could properly determine that good cause existed to deny a corporation's request for a declaratory ruling as to the potential future agreements because given
                        the missing material terms of the contracts, any ruling on whether the contracts were in compliance with the statute would be purely hypothetical; the corporation could not show that any of its legal rights were legally impaired.

                        that actually bound the corporation and the North Carolina Department of State Treasurer, there was no decision on the merits before the trial court or the court of appeals. Equity Solutions of the Carolinas, Inc. v. N.C. Dep't
