        <p>
            Indictment Must State That Act Was Committed on Sunday. - An indictment for an act which is criminal when committed on a Sunday must state that the act in question was committed on a Sunday; but if it does so, no exception can be taken to it for reference
            to the same day by a wrong day of the month. State v. Drake, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 589</cite> (1870).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Sufficiency of Indictment. - Under the former reading of the section, a conviction was sustainable under an indictment charging the defendant with being "found off his premises on the Sabbath day, having with him a shotgun, contrary to the form of the
            statute," etc. State v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. 24</cite> (1872).

        <p>
            Sunday is not a judicial day; hence an adjournment of the court from Saturday night to Monday morning during the progress of a trial for murder is not violative of the act requiring the adjournment to be "from day to day." State v. Howard,
            <cite
                class="nc_code">82 N.C. 623</cite> (1880).
                <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            When Court May Sit on Sunday. - There have been some instances in the judicial proceedings in this State where the courts have held their sessions on Sunday, but the cases are rare, and whenever it has been done, exception has generally been taken to
            the course of the court, upon the ground that it could not legally sit on that day. But the Supreme Court has held that in special cases ex necessitate the court might sit on Sunday. State v. Ricketts, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 187</cite>            (1876); State v. McGimsey, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 377</cite> (1879); State v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 623</cite> (1880).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Term of Court Embraces Sunday. - When a term of court is set by statute to begin on a certain Monday, and to last for "one week" (or two or three weeks, as the case may be), it embraces the Sunday of each week (unless sooner adjourned), and the term expires
            by limitation at midnight of that day. Taylor v. Ervin, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 274</cite>, 25 S.E. 875 (1896).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Verdict of Jury and Judgment. - A verdict entered on the Sunday of a week set for the duration of a court, in the absence of an earlier adjournment, is legally entered. Taylor v. Ervin, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 274</cite>, 25 S.E. 875
            (1896).
        </p>
        <p>
            There being no inhibition of a verdict rendered on Sunday, either at common law or by statute, a judgment entered on that day (by virtue of the statute, that it shall be entered up at once on the verdict) is valid. Taylor v. Ervin, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 274</cite>,
            25 S.E. 875 (1896).
        </p>
        <p>
            The rendition by the jury of a verdict on Sunday is not invalid for that cause. Tuttle v. Tuttle, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 484</cite>, 59 S.E. 1008 (1907).

            and issued General Order Number Three almost two and one-half years after President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation; and

     CASE NOTES
    </b>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This section relates to statewide public holidays. Hardbarger v. Deal, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 31</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 771 (1962).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Effect of Legal Holiday Generally. - The statute declaring certain days public holidays does not prohibit the pursuit of the usual avocations of citizens, nor keep public officers or the courts from exercising their respective functions on those days.
            While it might be that the attendance of jurors, witnesses and suitors will not be enforced, and the courts will not sue out or enforce process on such days, yet the courts may lawfully proceed with the business before them. State v. Moore,
            <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 743</cite>, 10 S.E. 183 (1889).
        </p>
        <p>
            The section simply declares that certain days therein specified, in each year, shall be public holidays, and the following section prescribes when papers coming due on such days, or on Sunday, shall be payable. It does not purport, in terms or effect,
            to prohibit persons from pursuing their usual avocations on such days, nor is there any inhibition upon public officers to exercise their offices, respectively, or upon the courts to sit on such days and exercise their functions and authority.
            There is no such statutory inhibition; nor, indeed, is there any, except such as may arise in the application of general principles of law. It has never been understood to be the law in this State that a public holiday is dies non juridicus,
            except perhaps to a limited extent; it is very certainly not wholly so. The courts, particularly the superior courts, very frequently sit on such days and hear and try causes and dispatch the business that ordinarily comes before them, especially
            when there is no objection. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 743</cite>, 10 S.E. 183 (1889).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Closing of County Clerk's Office on Easter Monday. - Where a county clerk's office was closed on Easter Monday, pursuant to resolution by the board of county commissioners in which Easter Monday was designated a holiday, a plaintiff, if otherwise entitled
            to commence an action on Easter Monday was entitled to commence the action on the next day the courthouse was open for business. Hardbarger v. Deal, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 31</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 771 (1962).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Judicial Notice That Certain Days Were Sundays or Public Holidays. - The court would take judicial notice of the fact that September 2, 1962, the last day of the two-year period beginning with the death of the plaintiff's intestate, was Sunday and that
            the following day was the first Monday in September, a public holiday. The action was instituted on September 4, 1962, by the issuance of summons and, therefore, was instituted within the time allowed by law. Kinlaw v. Norfolk S. Ry.,
            <cite
                class="nc_code">269 N.C. 110</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 329 (1967).
                <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Deposition Opened on Holiday. - A legal holiday has not the same status in respect to legal proceedings as a Sunday; and while depositions opened on the latter day are void, they are not so when they are opened on a legal holiday. Latta v. Catawba Elec.
            Co., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 285</cite>, 59 S.E. 1028 (1907).

     Effect on Foreclosure Upset Period and Filing of Bankruptcy
    </b> - Bankruptcy court found that because March 25 was Greek Independence Day and was a holiday under G.S. 103-4(3a), the 10-day upset period had not expired under G.S. 45-21.27(a) when the debtor filed bankruptcy after the close of business
            on March 25, which would otherwise have been the 10th day; thus, the bankruptcy court vacated its prior order granting the creditors relief from the automatic stay. In re Country Lake Enters., 284 B.R. 223 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2002).
