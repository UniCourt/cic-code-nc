                            citizens to exercise public trust rights and, therefore, recognizes the role that publicly and privately owned piers, docks, wharves, marinas, and other structures located in or over State-owned lands covered by navigable waters

                        Littoral rights do not include ownership of the foreshore. The littoral owner may, however, in exercise of his right of access, construct a pier in order to provide passage from the upland to the sea. But the passage under the pier must be free and substantially
                        unobstructed over the entire width of the foreshore. This means that from low to high water mark it must be at such a height that the public will have no difficulty in walking under it when the tide is low or in going under it
                        in boats when the tide is high. West v. Slick, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 33</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 601 (1985).

                        Ownership of Foreshore Remains in State. - There is nothing in this section or G.S. 146-64 to change the general rule that ownership of the foreshore remains in the State. On the contrary, it is noteworthy that a special class was created for the protection
                        of the foreshore and the marginal seas. Therefore, littoral rights do not include ownership of the foreshore. Carolina Beach Fishing Pier, Inc. v. Town of Carolina Beach, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 297</cite>,

        Title to Raised Land Vested in State.
       </b> - Although good title to beach property was conveyed to a town through a special legislative grant in 1939, recent publicly funded projects, which raised land above the mean high water mark by hydraulic dredging or
                        deposition of spoil or sand, would have vested title in the State by operation of law pursuant to this section. See opinion of Attorney General to P.A. Wojciechowski, Division of Marine Fisheries, 1998 N.C.A.G. 18 (4/6/98).

        Ownership of Accreted Land.
       </b> - If a town's blocking off an old navigational channel were to cause significant accretion along the old (existing) channel's shoreline, the newly accreted land would be owned by the current owner of the upland property.

        Ownership of Raised Lands.
       </b> - If a town were to directly place a portion of dredged material along an old (existing) channel shoreline (i.e., beside threatened homes), thereby creating a small strip of land along that shoreline above the mean
                        high water mark, title to the raised lands would vest in the adjacent upland owner in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Representative Jean Preston, 2003 N.C.A.G. 7 (9/15/03).

                    The State, acting at the request of the Department of Environmental Quality, is fully authorized and empowered to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of any and all mineral deposits belonging to the State which may be found in the bottoms of any sounds,
                    rivers, creeks, or other waters of the State. The State, acting at the request of the Department of Environmental Quality, is authorized and empowered to convey or lease to such person or persons as it may, in its discretion, determine,
                    the right to take, dig, and remove from such bottoms such mineral deposits found therein belonging to the State as may be sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of to them by the State. The State, acting at the request of the Department

                    such other terms and conditions as may be deemed wise and expedient by the State and to the best interest of the State. Before any such sale, lease, or contract is made, it shall be approved by the Department of Administration and

                        of shoreline multiplied by a factor of 54 feet. No linear feet of shoreline may be used in computing the credit if that area of shoreline has been the basis of a previous credit. For purposes of determining the linear feet of shoreline
                        owned, an application submitted by a corporation or other entity whose members include riparian or littoral lot owners, which owners have the right to use the structure for which the easement is sought, and whose lots are restricted
                        from construction thereon of other structures for similar use, shall be considered an application whose easement purchase payment shall be determined by using the entirety of such use restricted shoreline for purposes of determining
                        the applicable riparian credit. Shoreline utilization shall be considered "use restricted" if riparian or littoral structures are prohibited by either permit condition or by restrictive covenant or similar, enforceable private
                        restriction.

                        Navigable Waters. - If a body of water in its natural condition can be navigated by watercraft, it is navigable in fact and, therefore, navigable in law, even if it has not been used for such purpose. Lands lying beneath such waters that are navigable
                        in law are the subject of the public trust doctrine. Gwathmey v. State ex rel. Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 287</cite>, 464 S.E.2d 674 (1995).

                        Marshlands Covered by Navigable Waters. - The General Assembly did not convey the marshlands covered by navigable waters to the State Board of Education (SBE) free of any applicable public trust rights and, therefore, the SBE could not convey such lands
                        to the plaintiffs' predecessors in title free of such public trust rights; thus, to the extent the marshlands at issue were covered by navigable waters, the people of North Carolina retained their full public trust rights. Gwathmey

                    in a non-State-owned facility to be used by the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement (hereinafter "State Board"). The square footage of the office space required by this section shall be not less than the total
                    square footage of the facilities occupied on the date this act becomes law by the State agencies that were consolidated in S.L. 2017-6 to establish the State Board (being the State Board of Elections, State Ethics Commission, and Secretary
                    of State personnel identified in Section 20 of S.L. 2017-6). Not later than September 1, 2017, the State Board shall house all personnel from the State agencies described in this section in the same office facility. If the establishment
                    of the State Board as provided in S.L. 2017-6 is temporarily or permanently enjoined by a court of law, the State agencies and personnel described in this section may remain housed in the office facility acquired as provided by this
                    section. The Department of Administration shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate any losses caused by vacancies in facilities that result from the relocation of personnel as provided for in this section.

                    "(b) In determining how to allocate or lease office space as required by subsection (a) of this section, the Department of Administration shall consider the requirements of the State Board, the availability of property already owned by the State or by
                    any State agency which might meet the requirements of the State Board, and the availability of other property which might meet the requirements of the State Board.

                        State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 371 (1971).

                        By this Article the legislature merely appointed the Department of Administration as acquisition agent and established the procedure it should follow in acquiring land. A statute which merely sets forth a mode of procedure will not impliedly grant the
                        power of eminent domain. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                        The Department can only effect the condemnation which the legislature authorizes. It may not decide the public purpose or initiate the project for which the State's power of eminent domain may be used. State v. Core Banks Club Properties,

                        Steps Required for Acquisition of Land by Purchase or Condemnation. - This Article provides that all acquisitions of land by the State or any State agency shall be made by the Department of Administration and approved by the Governor and Council of State.
                        Before the Department can acquire land by purchase or condemnation the following steps must be taken: (1) The agency must file with the Department an application setting forth its need for the requested acquisition; (2) The Department
                        must investigate all aspects of the requested acquisition (including the availability of the necessary funds) as detailed in G.S. 146-23; (3) After investigation, the Department must determine that the best interests of the State
                        require that the land be acquired; (4) The Department must then negotiate with the owners for the purchase. If terms are agreed upon and the Governor and Council of State approve them, the Department buys the land; (5) If negotiations
                        are unsuccessful and the Governor and Council of State give permission, the Department institutes condemnation proceedings as provided in G.S. 146-24 and G.S. 136-103. State v. Core Banks Club Properties,

                        the Council of State does not have the authority to examine all lease proposals and to require the Department of Administration to negotiate and enter a lease other than the lease proposal submitted by the Department of Administration.

                    Provided, however, that such preference shall be given only when the Department of Administration, after investigation as provided in this Article, determines that such proposal is feasible, prudent and in the best interest of the

                        Strict Construction. - In construing statutes which are claimed to authorize the exercise of the power of eminent domain, a strict rather than a liberal construction is the rule. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>,
                        167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                        Power of Eminent Domain as Prerogative of Sovereign State. - The right to take private property for public use, the power of eminent domain, is one of the prerogatives of a sovereign state. The right is inherent in sovereignty; it is not conferred by
                        constitutions. Its exercise, however, is limited by the constitutional requirements of due process and payment of just compensation for property condemned. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>,
                        167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                    <p>
                        The right of eminent domain must be conferred by statute, either in express words or by necessary implication. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                    <p>
                        The right of eminent domain lies dormant in the State until the legislature, by statute, confers the power and points out the occasion, mode, conditions and agencies for its exercise. State v. Core Banks Club Properties,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                    <p>
                        As only the legislative branch can authorize exercise of the power of eminent domain and prescribe the manner of its use. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Executive branch cannot, without the authority of some statute, proceed to condemn property for its own uses. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Once authority is given to exercise the power of eminent domain, the matter ceases to be wholly legislative. The executive authorities may then decide whether the power will be invoked and to what extent, and the judiciary must decide whether the statute
                        authorizing the taking violates any constitutional rights; moreover, the fixing of compensation is wholly a judicial question. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>,

                    about the possibility of converting the facility to other use. In developing a proposal for future use of each facility, the Department shall give priority to converting the facility to other criminal justice use. Consistent with existing
                    law and the future needs of the Department of Public Safety, the State may provide for the transfer or the lease of any of these facilities to counties, municipalities, State agencies, federal agencies, or private firms wishing to
                    convert them to other use. G.S. 146-29.1(f) through (g) shall not apply to a transfer made pursuant to this section. The Department of Public Safety may also consider converting some of the facilities recommended for closing from one
                    security custody level to another, where that conversion would be cost-effective. A prison unit under lease to a county pursuant to the provisions of this section for use as a jail is exempt for the period of the lease from any of
                    the minimum standards adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to G.S. 153A-221 for the housing of adult prisoners that would subject the unit to greater standards than those required of a unit of the State prison

                    of confinement in response to violation (CRV) pursuant to G.S. 15A-1344(d2). Prior to opening a new CRV facility pursuant to this subsection, the Department of Public Safety shall consult with the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee

                        All entries which have been filed with entry-takers within one year prior to June 2, 1959, or filed more than one year prior to June 2, 1959, but still pending due to the filing of protest to the entry, shall be processed pursuant to the provisions of
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.146.html" target="_blank">Chapter 146</a></cite> of the General Statutes as it read immediately prior to June 2, 1959. Every such entry shall be paid for within
                        one year from the date of entry, unless a protest be filed to the entry, in which event it shall be paid for within one year after final judgment on the protest; and all entries not thus paid for shall become null and void, and
                        shall not be subject to renewal. It shall be the duty of both the enterer and protestant to conclude, within 12 months from June 2, 1959, all actions wherein a protest has been filed, and such cases shall be given preference on
                        the dockets of the courts of the State. Any action not so concluded shall be deemed a lapse as to enterer and protestant. It is not the intent of this proviso to void any previous grant of the State of North Carolina, or to divest
                        any vested right, but to terminate all rights accrued on account of an entry wherein no grant has been made. Provided that the resident judge of the superior court or the judge holding the superior courts of the district where
                        the land lies, may, for good cause shown, extend the time within which an action in which a protest has been filed is required by this section to be concluded; but no single extension shall exceed one year in duration. A copy of
                        this section shall be mailed by the Secretary of State to all parties to actions wherein protests have been filed as may be determined by records available in his office, and to all clerks of the superior court of the State.

                        Notice of Surveys. - Prior to enactment of the statute from which this section is derived, an entry of the State's vacant and unappropriated lands too vague to give notice of the boundaries of the land intended to be entered was not sufficient notice
                        to a second enterer who had perfected his grant in ignorance of the first; and the mere running of the lines of the lands by survey or the making of a map by the first enterer, which he could keep in his possession, or the warrant
                        to the county surveyor, necessarily no more definite than the original entry, did not remedy the defective description of the entry. However, the statute from which this section is derived provided for notice of all surveys, so
                        that this problem should not hereafter arise. Lovin v. Carver, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 710</cite>, 64 S.E. 775 (1911).

                    Whereas many citizens of the State, on making entries of lands near the lines of the county wherein they reside, either for want of proper knowledge of the land laws of the State or not knowing the county lines, have frequently made entries and extended
                    their surveys on such entries into other counties than those wherein they were made, and obtained grants on the same; and whereas doubts have existed with respect to the validity of the titles to lands situated as aforesaid, so far
                    as they extend into other counties than those where the entries were made; for remedy whereof it is hereby declared that all grants issued on entries made for lands situated as aforesaid shall be good and valid against any entries
                    thereafter made or grants issued thereon.

                    mistake, with all the matters and things relative thereto. The court may hear testimony respecting the truth of the allegations set forth in the petition; and if it shall appear by the testimony, from the return of the surveyor or
                    the error of the Secretary, that the patentee is liable to be injured thereby, the court shall direct the clerk to certify the facts to the Secretary of State, who shall file the same in his office, and correct the error in the patent,
                    and likewise in the records of his office. The costs of such suit shall be paid by the petitioner, except when any person may have made himself a party to prevent the prayer of the petitioner being granted, in which case the costs

                    is ordered to be rectified, and the same has been carried through from the grant into mesne conveyances, the court shall direct a copy of the order to be recorded in the register's book of the county: Provided no such petition shall

                        Certificate of Secretary of State as Sufficient Evidence for Registration. - The certificate of the Secretary of State of North Carolina, attached to a grant of land and attested by the great seal of the State, is sufficient evidence of its official character

                        Extension of Time for Registration. - Prior to 1885 the statutes provided that all grants, deeds, etc., be registered in the county wherein the land was situated within two years from the date thereof. With one or two omissions, the legislature uniformly
                        extended the time for registration for two years. The Supreme Court with equal uniformity held that such instruments, when registered within two years from their date or within the extended period, were good and valid for all purposes

                    When any person claiming title to lands under a grant or patent from the King of Great Britain, any of the lords proprietors of North Carolina, or from the State of North Carolina, shall consider himself aggrieved by any grant or patent issued or made
                    since July 4, 1776, to any other person, against law or obtained by false suggestions, surprise, or fraud, the person aggrieved may bring a civil action in the superior court for the county in which such land may be, together with
                    an authenticated copy of such grant or patent, briefly stating the grounds whereon such patent should be repealed and vacated, whereupon the grantee, patentee, or the person, owner, or claimant under such grant or patent, shall be
                    required to show cause why the same shall not be repealed and vacated.

                <p>
                    In all controversies and suits for any land to which the State or any State agency or its assigns shall be a party, the title to such lands shall be taken and deemed to be in the State or the State agency or its assigns until the other party shall show
                    that he has a good and valid title to such lands in himself.

                    In all controversies touching the title or the right of possession of any lands claimed by the State or by any State agency under any sale for taxes at any time heretofore made or which hereafter may be made, the deed of conveyance made by the sheriff
                    or other officer or person making such sale, or who may have been authorized to execute such deed, shall be presumptive evidence that the lands therein mentioned were, at the time the lien for such taxes attached and at the time of
                    the sale, the property of the person therein designated as the delinquent owner; that such lands were subject to taxation; that the taxes were duly levied and assessed; that the lands were duly listed; that the taxes were due and unpaid;
                    that the manner in which the listing, assessment, levy, and sale were conducted was in all respects as the law directed; that all the prerequisites of the law were duly complied with by all officers or persons who had or whose duty
                    it was to have had any part or action in any transaction relating to or affecting the title conveyed or purported to be conveyed by the deed, from the listing and valuation of the property up to the execution of the deed, both inclusive;
                    and that all things whatsoever required by law to make a good and valid sale and vest the title in the purchaser were done, and that all recitals in such deed contained are true as to each and every of the matters so recited.

                <p>
                    In all controversies and suits involving the title to real property claimed and held under and by virtue of a deed made substantially as above, the person claiming title adverse to the title conveyed by such deed shall be required to prove, in order to
                    defeat such title, either that the real property was not subject to taxation for the year or years named in the deed, that the taxes had been paid before the sale, that the property had been redeemed from the sale according to the
                    provisions of law, and that such redemption was had or made for the use or benefit of persons having the right of redemption under the laws of this State, or that there had been an entire omission to list or assess the property or
                    to levy the taxes or to sell the property; but no person shall be permitted to question the title acquired under such sale and deed without first showing that he or the person under whom he claims title had title to the property at
                    the time of the sale, and that all taxes due upon the property have been paid by such person or the person under whom he claims title.

                        Presumption That Officials Have Done Their Duty Upheld. - It is entirely proper and competent for the State to provide that the presumption that public officials have done their duty should apply, and throw upon any adverse claimant the burden of proving
                        the contrary. State Bd. of Educ. v. Remick, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 562</cite>, 76 S.E. 627 (1912), distinguishing King v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 347</cite>, 38 S.E. 924 (1901), petition

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statutory presumption created by this section is not unconstitutional. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 673, 300 S.E.2d 42, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 547</cite>,

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The presumption created by this section is reasonable since title to all lands in North Carolina, except those previously granted by the Crown, originated from the State, and the State has ultimate title to the soil. In addition, the statute does not
                        authorize a "taking" of property. The presumption of title in the State lasts only until the rival claimant establishes valid title in himself. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite>                        673, 300 S.E.2d 42, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 547</cite>, 303 S.E.2d 823 (1983), appeal dismissed, 465 U.S. 1075, 104 S. Ct. 1432, 79 L. Ed. 2d 756 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The State has the ultimate title to the soil. Since title to land is originally acquired from the State, it is reasonable to assume that, absent proof otherwise, title to any parcel within its boundaries reposes there. Therefore the presumption of title
                        in the State created under this section passes constitutional muster. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 304 S.E.2d 767 (1983), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 311</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Purpose of Presumption. - The presumption created by this section in favor of the State was enacted to avoid undesirable and chaotic consequences which would result if title to the subject land were in limbo. Taylor v. Johnston,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">289 N.C. 690</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 567 (1976).

                        Title Is Taken to Be in State in Action Brought Thereby. - In an action instituted by the State to remove a cloud on title to a tract of coastal marshland, title to the lands in controversy shall be taken to be in the State, unless and until the other
                        party shows that he has a good and valid title to such lands in himself. State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 45</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 553 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Presumption of Ownership of Swampland. - Under former G.S. 146-90, when it was shown that land was swampland and within a swamp of more than 2,000 acres, the law presumed that the Board of Education was the owner thereof. State Bd. of Educ. v. Makely,
                        <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 31</cite>, 51 S.E. 784 (1905); State Bd. of Educ. v. Roanoke R.R. &amp; Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 313</cite>, 73 S.E. 994 (1912).

                        Presumption of title in the State lasts only until the rival claimant establishes valid title in himself. State v. Chadwick, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 229 S.E.2d 255 (1976).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The presumption of title lasts only until good title is shown to be in another party. New Hanover Shingle Mills Co. v. John L. Roper Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 221</cite>, 100 S.E. 332 (1919).

                    <p>
                        Defendants must carry the burden of proof by showing a connected chain of title from the sovereign to them for the identical lands claimed by them. State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 45</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 553 (1971).

                    <p>
                        In suits for land in which the State or a State agency is a party, the burden of proof is on the party seeking to prove title against the State. Taylor v. Johnston, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 186, 218 S.E.2d 500
                        (1975).

                        Title Held Vested in State on Failure of Defendants to Meet Burden. - Where defendants failed to show they had a good and valid title to the subject land in themselves, and the identity and location of the subject land was established by stipulation,
                        as between the State of North Carolina and defendants, this section vested title in the State, and the court erred in submitting the issue to the jury, the question for decision being a matter of law for the court. State v. Brooks,
                        <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 45</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 553 (1971).

        In action for damages for alleged trespass in the cutting of timber
