     CASE NOTES
    </b>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Constitutionality. - Session Laws 1901, c. 557, known as the "London Libel Law" and subsequently appearing as G.S. 2429, 2430 and 2431 of the Consolidated Statutes (now subsection (a) of this section, G.S. 99-2(a), and G.S. 99-3, respectively), was held
            constitutional in Osborn v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 47 S.E. 811 (1904). See also Pentuff v. Park, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 146</cite>, 138 S.E. 616, 53 A.L.R. 626 (1927).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Complaint Must Allege Notice. - Under this section, a complaint in an action for libel must allege the giving of five days' notice to the defendant in writing, specifying the article and the statements alleged to be false. Williams v. Smith,
            <cite
                class="nc_code">134 N.C. 249</cite>, 46 S.E. 502 (1904).
                <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Failure to Allege Notice. - In an action against a newspaper for libel, the failure of the complainant to allege the five days' notice rendered it demurrable. Osborn v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 47 S.E. 811 (1904).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Amendment Showing Notice. - Where a demurrer was sustained to a complaint for libel against a newspaper because it failed to appear that notice of the action had been given, the trial court could permit an amendment showing that fact. Osborn v. Leach,
            <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 47 S.E. 811 (1904).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Letter as Sufficient Notice. - A letter written by plaintiff and received by defendant, in which demand was made for a retraction and apology for a clearly specified article, and in which the alleged false and defamatory statements were plainly indicated,
            was a sufficient notice in writing as required by this section, the provisions of former G.S. 1-585 (see now G.S. 1A-1, Rule 5) relating to notice in judicial proceedings after suit has been instituted, not being applicable. Roth v. Greensboro
            News Co., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 23</cite>, 197 S.E. 569 (1938).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Failure to Give Notice. - In an action for libel against a newspaper, the failure to give notice of the action as required only relieves the paper of punitive damages. Osborn v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 47 S.E. 811
            (1904).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            When Notice Unnecessary. - In an action for libel, where the newspaper publishes a retraction, no notice need be given. Osborn v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 47 S.E. 811 (1904).
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether the provisions of this Chapter as to notice to the defendant in an action for libel, looking to retraction and apology, apply to individuals having no connection with a newspaper publishing the libel, was questioned in Paul v. National Auction
            Co., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 1</cite>, 105 S.E. 881 (1921).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Compensatory Damages. - This section and G.S. 99-2, relating to notice looking to a retraction and apology, having significance only on the question of punitive damages, do not include compensatory damages for "pecuniary loss, physical pain, mental suffering,
            and injury to reputation." In Osborn v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 43 S.E. 811 (1904), it was held that an action for libel may proceed for the recovery of compensatory damages, whether the notice has been
            given or otherwise. Paul v. National Auction Co., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 1</cite>, 105 S.E. 881 (1921). See Kindley v. Privette, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 140</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 660 (1954).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            For case in which service of notice under former G.S. 1-585 was distinguished, see Roth v. Greensboro News Co., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 23</cite>, 197 S.E. 569 (1938).

     CASE NOTES
    </b>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Constitutionality. - Subsection (a) of this section, providing that a newspaper publishing a libel may avoid, under certain conditions, the payment of punitive damages, is not discriminatory, and is a constitutional enactment. Pentuff v. Park,
            <cite
                class="nc_code">194 N.C. 146</cite>, 138 S.E. 616, 53 A.L.R. 626 (1927). See also Osborn v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 47 S.E. 811 (1904).
        </p>
        <p>
            A recovery of actual damages does not abridge the freedom of the press. Pentuff v. Park, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 146</cite>, 138 S.E. 616, 53 A.L.R. 626 (1927).
        </p>
        <p>
            Where a statute for libel applies equally to all newspapers and periodicals, it does not amount to unconstitutional discrimination. Osborn v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 47 S.E. 811 (1904).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Form of Retraction. - While this section does not prescribe any particular form of retraction, it does require a categorical retraction and apology. The mere statement that defendant had come into possession of information contrary to that theretofore
            published was insufficient to meet the requirements of this section, nor was it incumbent on plaintiff to approve or disapprove thereof, and this failure to do so did not exculpate defendant or preclude the submission of an issue of punitive
            damages. Roth v. Greensboro News Co., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 13</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 882 (1940).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            "Actual Damages". - The "actual damages" recoverable in a suit for libelous publication by a newspaper in the event of a retraction, allowed by the statute, is for pecuniary loss, direct or indirect, or for physical pain and inconvenience. Pentuff v.
            Park, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 146</cite>, 138 S.E. 616, 53 A.L.R. 626 (1927).
        </p>
        <p>
            Actual damages also include mental suffering and injury to reputation. Osborn v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 47 S.E. 811 (1904).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Damages When Defendants Do Not Comply. - Where the defendants did not avail themselves of the privilege given them under this section, the damages that could be awarded would include punitive as well as actual damages. Pentuff v. Park,
            <cite
                class="nc_code">194 N.C. 146</cite>, 138 S.E. 616, 53 A.L.R. 626 (1927).
                <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Damages as "Property". - The right to have punitive damages assessed is not property, but the right to recover actual or compensatory damages is property. Osborn v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 47 S.E. 811 (1904).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Only Actual Damages Recoverable Where Publication in Good Faith Is Followed by Correction. - Where plaintiff's evidence established a false publication, and defendant's evidence showed that the publication was made in good faith through error, and that
            a correction and retraction was published upon defendant ascertaining the facts, plaintiff was entitled to recover the actual damage sustained by him. Lay v. Gazette Publishing Co., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 134</cite>, 183
            S.E. 416 (1936).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            No Punitive Damages May Be Recovered in the Absence of Malice or Wantonness and Recklessness. See Lay v. Gazette Publishing Co., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 134</cite>, 183 S.E. 416 (1936).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            For definition of actual malice, see Cline v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 210 S.E.2d 446 (1974), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 412</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 793 (1975).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            When Malice May Not Be Inferred by Jury. - Malice may not be inferred by the jury from a false publication when defendant's uncontradicted evidence rebuts the presumption by showing that the publication was made in good faith through error, and that a
            correction and retraction was published upon defendant ascertaining the facts. Lay v. Gazette Publishing Co., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 134</cite>, 183 S.E. 416 (1936).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Defendant's Pleading. - In an action for libel against a newspaper, the paper having pleaded a retraction of the publication, it is necessary for the defendant to show that the publication was made in good faith, and with reasonable ground to believe
            it to be true, in order to relieve the paper from punitive damages. Osborn v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 628</cite>, 47 S.E. 811 (1904).
