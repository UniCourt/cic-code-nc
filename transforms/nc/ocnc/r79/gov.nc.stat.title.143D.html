       Editor's Note.
      </b> - The preamble to Session Laws 2007-520 provides: "Whereas, the people of North Carolina entrust the oversight of public institutions to elected and appointed officials for the purpose of furthering the public interest;
                    and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, the oversight of those public institutions requires an effective and efficient system of internal control providing reasonable assurance that the public's objectives are met; and

                <p>
                    "Whereas, ensuring such a system of internal control requires applicable statewide standards and specific assignment of related responsibilities; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, for a system of internal control to continue to operate properly, responsibilities for and within the system must be clearly demarked; Now, therefore,".
