                <p>
                    In case of the insolvency of a corporation, partnership or individual, all persons doing labor or service of whatever character in its regular employment have a lien upon the assets thereof for the amount of wages due to them for all labor, work, and
                    services rendered within two months next preceding the date when proceedings in insolvency were actually instituted and begun against the corporation, partnership or individual, which lien is prior to all other liens that can be acquired
                    against such assets: Provided, that the lien created by this section shall not apply to multiple unit dwellings, apartment houses, or other buildings for family occupancy except as to labor performed on the premises upon which the
                    lien is claimed. This section shall not apply to any single unit family dwelling.

        Section Gives Ancillary Remedy.
       </b> - This section, giving to laborers of insolvent corporations a specific lien upon the assets of the company for two months' wages at least, was not intended to militate against rights that they might otherwise have
                        under the existing law for debts due them, but gives them a special lien for certain wages. Union Trust Co. v. Southern Sawmills &amp; Lumber Co., 166 F. 193 (4th Cir. 1908), cert. denied, 215 U.S. 596, 30 S. Ct. 398, 54 L. Ed.

                        The creditors favored by this section are laborers and workers and all persons doing labor or service of whatever character in the regular employment of certain corporations. Phoenix Iron Co. v. Roanoke Bridge Co., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 512</cite>,
                        86 S.E. 184 (1915).

                    <p>
                        This section grants a priority lien for the wages paid regular employees. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Academic Archives, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 186, 189 S.E.2d 551 (1972).
                        <br />

                        A contractor, who furnishes his own teams, labor, etc., in hauling materials for the building of a bridge by a corporation within the two months next preceding the date of the institution of proceedings in insolvency is not engaged in doing labor or performing
                        "service of whatever character" within the meaning of this section. Phoenix Iron Co. v. Roanoke Bridge Co., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 512</cite>, 86 S.E. 184 (1915).

                        Independent Contractor Defined. - An independent contractor is one who (1) is engaged in an independent business, calling or occupation; (2) is to have the independent use of his special skill, knowledge, or training in the execution of the work; (3)
                        is doing a specified piece of work at a fixed price or for a lump sum or upon a quantitative basis; (4) is not subject to discharge because he adopts one method of doing the work rather than another; (5) is not in the regular employ
                        of the other contracting party; (6) is free to use such assistants as he may think proper; (7) has full control over such assistants; and, (8) selects his own time. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Academic Archives, Inc.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 186, 189 S.E.2d 551 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Test of Employee Status. - The vital test of who are regular employees and who are independent contractors is to be found in whether the employer has or has not retained the right of control or superintendence over the contractor or employee as to details.
                        First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Academic Archives, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 186, 189 S.E.2d 551 (1972).

                        A practicing attorney rendering professional services to a client is an independent contractor, and his claim is not entitled to a priority under this section. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Academic Archives, Inc.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 186, 189 S.E.2d 551 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Agent with Authority to Deduct Salary from Collections. - Under this section, an agent with authority to make collections and to deduct his salary and expenses from the sums collected has no lien for claims for salary earned and expenses incurred before
                        his appointment to the position and more than two months before the appointment of a receiver. Cummer Lumber Co. v. Seminole Phosphate Co., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 206</cite>, 126 S.E. 511 (1925).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Claim Based on Contracts for Single Piece of Work. - The claim of an independent company which repaired machinery belonging to the insolvent partnership on a single occasion at a contract price fixed by mutual agreement could not constitute a preferred
                        claim under this section, since the claim was for the unpaid contract price, and not wages. Moreover, the claim was based on a single piece of work. The company was not hired to do permanent or steady work in the usual course of
                        the occupation of another, and this being true, it did not render the service in the regular employment of another. National Sur. Corp. v. Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 35</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 109
                        (1952).

                    <p>
                        Work Done for Receiver. - Claims of laborers for wages due them for work done for the receiver of an insolvent partnership during the receivership cannot qualify for a preferred status under this section. National Sur. Corp. v. Sharpe,
                        <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 35</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 109 (1952).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section does not apply to any wages except those due "for labor, work, and services rendered within," i.e., inside the limits of, "two months next preceding the date when proceedings in insolvency were actually instituted and begun." National Sur.
                        Corp. v. Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 35</cite>, 57, 72 S.E.2d 109 (1952), disapproving the suggestion contained in Walker v. Linden Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 460</cite>, 87 S.E.
                        331 (1915), that the word "within" meant "subsequent," and that the statute, therefore, gave laborers "a first lien" for all their wages accruing "after 60 days prior to the insolvency," notwithstanding the supervening receivership.
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Severance Pay Is Not Wages Earned. - Employees under a contract providing for severance pay are not entitled to a lien for such pay against the receiver, since severance pay is not wages earned. In re Port Publishing Co.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 395</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 366, 14 A.L.R.2d 842 (1950).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Employees under a contract providing for paid vacations have a lien against the receiver of the employer for one-sixth of their vacation pay, since this amount was earned during the two months next preceding the institution of insolvency proceedings.
                        In re Port Publishing Co., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 395</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 366, 14 A.L.R.2d 842 (1950).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        When Lien Arises. - The lien of the employees arises upon the sequestration of the property of the insolvent for the purpose of liquidation, or rather the institution of a proceeding for that purpose. The lien does not exist so long as the property remains
                        in the hands of the insolvent. It arises when the property is taken in custodia legis for the purpose of distribution among the creditors. Leggett v. Southeastern People's College, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 595</cite>,
                        68 S.E.2d 263 (1951), commented on in 30 N.C.L. Rev. 442 (1952).

                        Prior Lienholders Protected. - Property acquired by a private corporation subject to a valid and registered mortgage does not become an asset of the corporation except as subject to the prior lien; and the lien given to laborers on the assets of an insolvent
                        corporation for work done under the conditions stated in this section cannot affect the vested rights obtained by the prior lienholders. Roberts v. Bowen Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 27</cite>,

                        Lienholder Taking Mortgage on Corporate Property Not Protected. - One who takes a mortgage upon corporation property for money loaned to operate it or to secure other debts does so with the knowledge that the lien of his mortgage is subject to be displaced
                        in favor of laborers' liens in case of insolvency. Humphrey Bros. v. Buell-Crocker Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 514</cite>, 93 S.E. 971 (1917).

                        Account as Asset of Bank upon Exercise of Offset. - Where insolvent corporate defendant had $2,568.55 balance with bank, where corporate defendant owed bank on note past due, and where bank was attached as debtor of corporate defendant, order of attachment
                        against bank could not be sustained on basis that twenty-one employees of depositor (i.e., corporate defendant) whose checks were outstanding had lien upon company's assets superior to all other liens under provisions of this section;
                        lien that employees had was against assets of their employer and did not attach to assets of others, and checking account balance became asset of bank upon right of offset being asserted. Killette v. Raemell's Sewing Apparel, Inc.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 162, 377 S.E.2d 73 (1989).

                        Priority of Claims of Federal Government. - While this section creates what is denominated a lien, in practical effect it grants to the employees of the insolvent a right of payment of the designated wages prior to the payment of any other claim, secured
                        or unsecured. This preference is subordinate to the right of the United States under the provisions of 31 U.S.C.

                        The purpose of filing claims for liens under this section is to give the public notice of the claims, the amount, the material supplied or the labor done, and when done, on what property, specified with such details as will give reasonable notice to all

                        What "Filing" Imports. - The filing of a lien for labor or materials imports more than mere delivery of the written claim to the clerk's office, and requires the transcribing of the notice of lien in the lien docket in the clerk's office and the indexing
                        of same in the name of the claimant; but, as distinguished from liens required by statute to be registered in the office of the register of deeds, it does not require cross-indexing. Saunders v. Woodhouse,
                        <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 608</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 701 (1956).

                    <p>
                        A lien for material and labor was properly filed where the clerk after delivery attached it in its original form to specified page in a book labeled "Lien Docket," where the book without question was the book intended as the lien docket contemplated by
                        former G.S. 2-42 (now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIIa12s7A-109" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-109</a></cite>), even though the book was also used for the filing of liens for old
                        age assistance, since former G.S. 108-30.1 provided that such liens should be filed in the regular lien docket. Saunders v. Woodhouse, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 608</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 701 (1956).

                        Particularity Required. - A claim of lien filed under the provisions of this section must comply with the requirements of the statute. Therefore, when the plaintiff's claim failed to specify in detail the material furnished and the labor performed, or

                        While a substantial compliance with this section is necessary to the validity of a lien filed for material, etc., furnished in the erection of a building, it is not required that the claimant file his itemized statement of the material used in a building
                        which he had contracted to complete for the owner for one sum; but the time of the completion of the work must be stated. Jefferson &amp; Bros. v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 404</cite>, 77 S.E.

                        This section does not require a listing of material item by item, or the labor hour by hour. Yet it demands more than a mere summary statement. It requires a statement in sufficient detail to put parties who are or may become interested in the premises
                        on notice as to the labor performed and material furnished, the time when the labor was performed and the material was furnished, the amount due therefor, and the property upon which it was employed. Lowery v. Haithcock,

                        Statements Held Sufficient. - When a lienor's schedule for material contains a full itemized statement in detail of the material furnished, and the clerk has entered on his docket the names of the lienor and lienee, the amount claimed by each lienor,
                        a description of the property by metes and bounds, and the dates between which the materials were furnished, referring to the schedule of prices and materials attached to the notice, and asking that it "be taken as a part of the
                        notice of lien," compliance with this section was sufficient. Fulp v. Kernersville Light &amp; Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 157</cite>, 72 S.E. 867 (1911).

                        Defects Not Cured by Amendment or Pleadings. - Where a laborer's claim of lien as filed was defective in failing to specify the time of his labor and that it was done on a particular crop, these defects were not cured by alleging the necessary facts in
                        the pleadings in action to enforce the lien. Cook v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 68</cite>, 7 S.E. 700 (1888).

                        Where suit was brought by a contractor to enforce a lien on a building which was to have been paid for in a single sum, and the claim as filed with the clerk was defective in not stating the time the house was completed, as required by this section, it
                        could not be cured by amendment allowed in the superior court at the trial. Jefferson &amp; Bros. v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 404</cite>, 77 S.E. 341 (1913).

                        A defect in a lien cannot be cured by amendment after the filing period has expired, nor by alleging the necessary facts in the pleadings in an action to enforce the lien. Mebane Lumber Co. v. Avery &amp; Bullock Bldrs., Inc.,

        Admiralty Proceedings.
       </b> - The provisions of this section and former G.S. 44-39 are not binding on an admiralty court in a proceeding to establish a lien for labor and materials furnished in the repair of a vessel, but the limitations which
                        they prescribe can be considered by the admiralty court in applying the doctrine of laches. Phelps v. The Cecelia Ann, 199 F.2d 627 (4th Cir. 1952).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While state statutory provisions of limitation do not bind a federal court in admiralty proceedings, it is proper to consider them in applying the principle of laches. Thus a proceeding to enforce a maritime lien for supplies and materials furnished to
                        a vessel and its owner was barred by laches, in view of this section and former G.S. 44-39, where the libel was not instituted until 21 months after the claim became due. Davis v. The Nola Dare, 157 F. Supp. 420 (E.D.N.C. 1957).

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 2018-52 provides in its preamble: "Whereas, the employee benefit programs operated by the Department of State Treasurer are an intergenerational partnership between public employees and taxpayers of the State,
                    it is incumbent upon the administrators of those programs to provide for Financial Accountability, Integrity, and Recovery of assets (FAIRness); and

                        Violation of Statute. - Trial court did not err in granting a hospital summary judgment because a settlement between an insurer and a patient resulted in insufficient funds to cover the hospital's liens; by issuing a multi-party check for the settlement
                        amount rather than a check solely payable to the hospital, the insurer violated the requirement that the retention of funds be sufficient to satisfy the lien, for which the insurer had proper notice. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State

        The lien of this section attaches to the recovery, if any, and is not a general lien

                    <p>
                        This section and G.S. 44-50 make any plaintiff's unpaid medical expenses a lien upon his recovery in a personal injury action. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Keith, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 577</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 731 (1973).

                        Lien Should Attach Before Payment by Insurance Company. - If a plaintiff under G.S. 44-50 is to have a lien such as is provided for in this section, the lien should attach before the insurance company makes its payments and when the parties agree upon
                        a settlement; this being so, the plaintiff may enforce the lien against the money which is payable for the personal injury. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth. v. First of Ga. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 88</cite>,

                        Failure to Timely Bill Insurer. - Patient's evidence of a hospital's lien was admissible because, when the hospital chose to rely on the hospital's lien on the patient's expected judgment against an alleged tortfeasor instead of timely billing the patient's
                        health insurer, the hospital did not abandon the lien as (1) applicable statutes permitted this choice, and (2) a contrary interpretation frustrated the fair medical billing statute, which did not intend to force hospitals to bill
                        insurers when other payment sources were available, so the patient remained indebted to the hospital under the medical lien statute. Sykes v. Vixamar, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. App.</cite> 130, 830

                    <p>
                        Minor Cannot Recover for Medical Expenses. - This section does not change the common-law rule so as to permit the recovery of expenses for medical treatment as a part of a minor's cause of action for injuries. Ellington v. Bradford,
                        <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 159</cite>, 86 S.E.2d 925 (1955); Price v. Seaboard Air Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 32</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 590 (1968).

                    <p>
                        Disbursement. - Insurer lost control over funds, as evidenced by its need to retrieve the multi-party check it issued to a patient prior to re-disbursing funds directly to a hospital, at the time it issued the check to the patient; the insurer's effective
                        loss of control over the funds amounted to a disbursement because the risks that the patient would simply not seek to negotiate the check were the consequences beyond the control of a settlement payor that the medical lien statutes
                        were intended to avoid. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 726, 803 S.E.2d 256 (2017), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 578</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Damages. - Trial court's calculation of damages awarded to a hospital was in error because when trebled based on the trial court's judgment that an insurer engaged in an unfair or deceptive trade practice, the total damages to which the hospital was entitled
                        was $ 971; a pro rata distribution to lienholders is required in the event that fifty percent of a judgment or settlement amount was insufficient to satisfy all valid medical liens. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

                    <p>
                        No Provision for Lien Where Patient Settles with Wrongdoer. - While this section creates a lien in favor of any person, corporation or governmental body which has provided medical care upon personal injury damages recovered in civil actions by patients
                        who have received medical treatment, there is no provision for creation of a lien where the patient settles with the wrongdoer instead of filing a civil action. Johnston County v. McCormick, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite>                        63, 308 S.E.2d 872 (1983).

                    <p>
                        Pro Rata Distribution of Funds Not Required - G.S. 44-49 and G.S. 44-50 do not require a pro rata distribution of funds among valid lien holders where there are insufficient funds to compensate all of the holders; thus, an attorney was properly granted
                        summary judgment in a hospital's action alleging violation of G.S. 44-49 and G.S. 44-50. N.C. Baptist Hosps., Inc. v. Crowson, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 746, 573 S.E.2d 922 (2003), aff'd,

                    <p>
                        Unfair And Deceptive Trade Practices. - Hospital was in privity with an insurer and was permitted to assert a claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices because the insurer was on notice of its duty to settle valid liens before disbursing funds directly
                        to a pro se claimant, and the hospital provided the insurer with the required documentation. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 726, 803 S.E.2d

                <p>
                    A lien as provided under G.S. 44-49 shall also attach upon all funds paid to any person in compensation for or settlement of the injuries, whether in litigation or otherwise. If an attorney represents the injured person, the lien is perfected as provided
                    under G.S. 44-49. Before their disbursement, any person that receives those funds shall retain out of any recovery or any compensation so received a sufficient amount to pay the just and bona fide claims for any drugs, medical supplies,
                    ambulance services, services rendered by any physician, dentist, nurse, or hospital, or hospital attention or services, after having received notice of those claims. Evidence as to the amount of the charges shall be competent in the

                    and State Employees shall be superior to all nongovernmental liens and rights, whether such liens and rights are prior or subsequent to the lien. Nothing in this section or in G.S. 44-49 shall be construed so as to interfere with any
                    amount due for attorney's services. The lien provided for shall in no case, exclusive of attorneys' fees, exceed fifty percent (50%) of the amount of damages recovered. Except as provided in G.S. 44-51, a client's instructions for
                    the disbursement of settlement or judgment proceeds are not binding on the disbursing attorney to the extent that the instructions conflict with the requirements of this Article.

                        Legislative Intent. - By directing third parties as to how to disburse funds received for personal injury claims and limiting percentage of balance of recovery, after deducting attorneys' fees, to be paid to those benefitted by statute, legislature intended
                        that such third parties pay no more than 50% of any such balance to service providers. North Carolina Baptist Hosps. v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 528</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 844 (1988).

                        Insurer's actual notice of the medical expenses incurred by an injured party created a lien against future settlement proceeds, where such notice was provided to the insurer by the pro se injured party rather than by the medical provider or the injured
                        party's attorney, thus triggering the obligations under G.S. 44-50; the intent of the statute was to ensure that medical service providers were paid when injured parties later received compensation for their injuries. Smith v.

                        Literal Interpretation Was Improper. - Plaintiff's argument that plain language of this section did not prevent assignment of proceeds of personal injury claim received by third party failed, because strictly literal interpretation would have contravened
                        intent of legislature, which was, in part, to provide that injured party receive some part of amount recovered for his injury by requiring third parties, receiving funds paid for personal injury claim, to pay no more than 50% of
                        amount recovered, exclusive of attorneys' fees, to service providers. North Carolina Baptist Hosps. v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 528</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 844 (1988).

                        Trial court did not err in granting a hospital summary judgment because a settlement between an insurer and a patient resulted in insufficient funds to cover the hospital's liens; by issuing a multi-party check for the settlement amount rather than a
                        check solely payable to the hospital, the insurer violated the provision requiring the retention of funds sufficient to satisfy the lien, for which the insurer had proper notice. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

                        Lien Should Attach Before Payment by Insurance Company. - If a plaintiff under this section is to have a lien such as is provided for in G.S. 44-49, the lien should attach before the insurance company makes its payments and when the parties agree upon
                        a settlement; this being so, the plaintiff may enforce the lien against the money which is payable for the personal injury. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth. v. First of Ga. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 88</cite>,

                        Disbursement. - Insurer lost control over funds, as evidenced by its need to retrieve the multi-party check it issued to a patient prior to re-disbursing funds directly to a hospital, at the time it issued the check to the patient; the insurer's effective
                        loss of control over the funds amounted to a disbursement because the risks that the patient would simply not seek to negotiate the check were the consequences beyond the control of a settlement payor that the medical lien statutes
                        were intended to avoid. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 726, 803 S.E.2d 256 (2017), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 578</cite>,

                        lien; by establishing this duty, the statute necessarily also creates a cause of action by which the State Health Plan may enforce its lien under the statute against an attorney who violates its requirements by failing to disburse
                        his client's settlement proceeds in accordance with the statute. State Health Plan for Teachers &amp; State Emples. v. Ellison, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 744 S.E.2d 473 (2013).

                        The doctrine of election of remedies did not bar plaintiff chiropractor's recovery from defendant attorney where the attorney's clients were liable to plaintiff for having received services for which they had not paid and the defendant was liable to plaintiff
                        pursuant to this section; the separate actions by plaintiff against either its patients or their attorney were not inconsistent and did not seek any additional or alternative forms of relief and there was no threat of double recovery,
                        as the defendants in each action could claim contribution for payments made by the other, both in defense of the suit and in defense of any proceedings to collect a judgment. Triangle Park Chiropractic v. Battaglia,

                        Unfair And Deceptive Trade Practices. - Trial court properly granted a hospital summary judgment because an insurer's unfair and deceptive conduct arose out of its violation of G.S. 44-50 and G.S. 44-50.1 and its repeated failure to settle a medical provider's
                        valid lien upon request; the insurer's failure to notify the medical lienholders of its settlement, and its direction of the hospital for months to seek its recovery from a patient were not only unfair but deceptive. Nash Hosps.,

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in concluding that an insurer committed an unfair trade practice because its failure to withhold funds subject to valid medical liens, including a hospital's lien, prior to its disbursement of funds to a patient resulted in an
                        actual injury to the hospital; the insurer's failure to retain funds delayed the hospital's recovery of funds to which it was legally entitled, and that delay constituted injury. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.
                        Co., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 726, 803 S.E.2d 256 (2017), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 578</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 869, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 128 (2018).

                        Insurer's violation of G.S. 44-49 and 44-50 and refusal to pay a hospital's lien before disbursing settlement funds to a pro se claimant amounted to an unfair or deceptive act because the insurer repeatedly refused to reissue a check payable solely to
                        the hospital; the hospital presented letters it sent to the insurer requesting payment of the lien, admissions by the insurer of receipt of those letters, and its admission of its failure to respond to the hospital's requests.

                        Hospital was in privity with an insurer and was permitted to assert a claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices because the insurer was on notice of its duty to settle valid liens before disbursing funds directly to a pro se claimant, and the hospital
                        provided the insurer with the required documentation. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 726, 803 S.E.2d 256 (2017), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 578</cite>,

                        Distribution of Proceeds Held Proper. - Action of defendant attorney in receiving $25,000.00 in settlement proceeds, deducting her fee of 25%, and then dividing the balance equally between injured party and medical providers was in direct accord with
                        this section. North Carolina Baptist Hosps. v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 263, 362 S.E.2d 841 (1987), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 528</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 844 (1988).

                        Attorney who followed disbursement provisions of this section when disbursing client's funds from personal injury settlement was not held liable for client's unpaid debt to medical service provider whom attorney knew had obtained client's assignment of

                        Unfair And Deceptive Trade Practices. - Trial court properly granted a hospital summary judgment because an insurer's unfair and deceptive conduct arose out of its violation of G.S. 44-50 and G.S. 44-50.1 and its repeated failure to settle a medical provider's
                        valid lien upon request; the insurer's failure to notify the medical lienholders of its settlement, and its direction of the hospital for months to seek its recovery from a patient were not only unfair but deceptive. Nash Hosps.,

                        Insurer's violation of G.S. 44-49 and G.S. 44-50 and refusal to pay a hospital's lien before disbursing settlement funds to a pro se claimant amounted to an unfair or deceptive act because the insurer repeatedly refused to reissue a check payable solely
                        to the hospital; the hospital presented letters it sent to the insurer requesting payment of the lien, admissions by the insurer of receipt of those letters, and its admission of its failure to respond to the hospital's requests.

                        Trial court did not err in concluding that an insurer committed an unfair trade practice because its failure to withhold funds subject to valid medical liens, including a hospital's lien, prior to its disbursement of funds to a patient resulted in an
                        actual injury to the hospital; the insurer's failure to retain funds delayed the hospital's recovery of funds to which it was legally entitled, and that delay constituted injury. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

                        Violation of Statute. - Trial court did not err in granting a hospital summary judgment because a settlement between an insurer and a patient resulted in insufficient funds to cover the hospital's liens; by issuing a multi-party check for the settlement
                        amount rather than a check solely payable to the hospital, the insurer violated the provision requiring the retention of funds sufficient to satisfy the lien, for which the insurer had proper notice. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State

                        Damages. - Trial court's calculation of damages awarded to a hospital was in error because when trebled based on the trial court's judgment that an insurer engaged in an unfair or deceptive trade practice, the total damages to which the hospital was entitled
                        was $ 971; the statute requires a pro rata distribution to lienholders in the event that fifty percent of a judgment or settlement amount was insufficient to satisfy all valid medical liens. Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State Farm Mut.

                        An obligee in a non-IV-D case who has received payment in full for a delinquent child support obligation which is the basis for the lien shall, within 30 days of receipt of payment, file with the clerk of court an acknowledgment that the obligor has satisfied
                        the full amount of the lien and that the lien is discharged. If the lienholder fails to timely file the acknowledgment, the obligor may, after serving notice on the obligee, file an action in district court to discharge the lien.
                        If in an action filed by the obligor to discharge the lien, the court discharges the lien and finds that the obligee failed to timely file an acknowledgment discharging the lien, then the court may allow the prevailing party to
                        recover reasonable attorneys' fees to be taxed as court costs against the obligee.
