                    be signed and sealed as shall be provided for the signing and sealing of such definitive bonds or notes, and shall be substantially of the tenor of such definitive bonds or notes except as herein otherwise provided and except that
                    such temporary bonds or notes shall contain such provisions as the Treasurer may elect as to the conditions of payment of the semiannual interest thereon. Every such temporary bond or note shall bear upon its face the words "Temporary
                    Bond (or Note) Exchangeable for Definitive Bond." Upon the completion and execution of the definitive bonds or notes, such temporary bonds or notes shall be exchangeable without charge therefor to the holder of such temporary bonds
                    or notes for definitive bonds or notes of an equal amount of principal. Such exchange shall be made by the Treasurer or by a bank or trust company in North Carolina or elsewhere appointed by him as agent which shall have a capital
                    and surplus of not less than the amount of the definitive bonds or notes to be so exchanged, and in making such exchange the Treasurer shall detach from the definitive bonds or notes all coupons which represent interest theretofore
                    paid upon the temporary bonds or notes to be exchanged therefor, and shall cancel all such coupons; and upon such exchange such temporary bonds or notes and the coupons attached thereto, if any, shall be forthwith canceled by the Treasurer
                    of such agent. Until so exchanged, temporary bonds and notes issued under the authority hereof shall in all respects be entitled to all the rights and privileges of the definitive securities.

                    By and with the consent of the Council of State, the State Treasurer is authorized to issue and sell, from time to time, refunding obligations for the purpose of refunding outstanding obligations as and to the extent authorized by this Article. The principal
                    amount of any such refunding obligations shall not exceed the principal amount of outstanding obligations to be refunded unless (i) the refunding results in an aggregate debt service savings and (ii) the increase in the principal amount
                    issued does not create cash-in-hand available for new capital improvements.

                    Refunding obligations issued pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall not be subject to limitations imposed by any other law including, without limitation, the other Articles of this Chapter.
