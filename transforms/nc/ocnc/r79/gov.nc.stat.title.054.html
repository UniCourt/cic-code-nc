                        later than the sixth year succeeding the year in which the loan was made the borrower may pay a larger installment upon the principal, or the whole of it, at any interest date, such payments to be in amounts equal to additions
                        of one or more principal amortization payments. Such payment may be made in cash, or by tendering at par bonds of the association. For failure to pay the interest or any installment required by the terms of the loan, the borrower
                        may be fined as the bylaws may prescribe. But the borrower shall never be required to pay more than the specified installment, nor to pay the principal before it is due except as prescribed herein for partial repayment on account
                        of depreciation and for foreclosure by the association. The borrower may on 60 days' notice repay the association his total indebtedness, or, without such notice, upon payment of 60 days' interest upon the principal unpaid. The
                        borrower shall be entitled to a receipt for all installments as paid, and where the repayment is complete to a satisfaction of his note and mortgage.

                    such additional coverage within 60 days after the date of written notice by the Administrator to such board of directors. For good cause shown, the Administrator may extend the time to obtain additional coverage.

       Performance Bonds.
      </b> - A State-chartered credit union, acting pursuant to 4 N.C.A.C. 06C.0311, must provide a performance bond for not only its chief executive officer but for other officers, employees, or agents. See opinion of Attorney General
                    to Mr. Stanley W. Brown, Jr., Deputy Administrator, Credit Union Div., Department of Commerce, 59 N.C.A.G. 8 (1989).

       The language of subdivision (5) of this section and of G.S. 54-109.44(2) relating to blanket surety bonds is mandatory
      </b> and extends to all state-chartered credit union officers, employees, agents, and others in a position of trust. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Stanley W. Brown, Jr., Deputy Administrator, Credit Union Division, Department
                    of Commerce, 59 N.C.A.G. 8 (1989).

       Conflicting Administrative Rule Was Void.
      </b> - To the extent that an administrative rule purported to permit an individual's bond to be substituted for the blanket bond or to permit an individual's bond to cover persons other than those specified in subdivision (5)
                    of this section, it was in conflict with controlling law and was void. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Stanley W. Brown, Jr., Deputy Administrator, Credit Union Division, Department of Commerce, 59 N.C.A.G. 8 (1989).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
       Discretion of Administrator and Board.
      </b> - The provision of subdivision (5) of this section requiring a surety bond of the "treasurer and all other persons handling credit union funds or records" means that the board of directors may require, consistent with administrative
                    rules promulgated by the administrator, an additional surety bond for those having actual possession of or control over credit union funds or financial records. Since the administrator has broad discretion and authority under G.S.
                    54-109.12 to prescribe rules "relating to financial records, business practices and the conduct and management of credit unions," the administrator can promulgate reasonable guidelines for boards of directors to follow in determining
                    the "amount and character" of the bond to be required. However, it is not within the discretion of a board of directors or the administrator to determine who shall be covered by the bond, other than to identify "persons handling credit
                    union funds or records." See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Stanley W. Brown, Jr., Deputy Administrator, Credit Union Division, Department of Commerce, 59 N.C.A.G. 8 (1989).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The additional bond provided for in subdivision (5) of this section, must cover "the treasurer and all other persons handling credit union funds or records." Nothing in the statutes permits the chief financial officer or the chief executive officer of
                    a state-chartered credit union to be substituted for the persons specified. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Stanley W. Brown, Jr., Deputy Administrator, Credit Union Division, Department of Commerce, 59 N.C.A.G. 8 (1989).

                    management, business practices and their financial and fiscal matters. The Administrator of Credit Unions may prescribe rules and regulations for the administration of this Article, as well as rules and regulations relating to financial
                    records, business practices and the conduct and management of credit unions, and it shall be the duty of the board of directors and of the various officers of the credit union to put into effect and to carry out such regulations.

       The provision of G.S. 54-109.11(5) requiring a surety bond
      </b> of the "treasurer and all other persons handling credit union funds or records" means that the board of directors may require, consistent with administrative rules promulgated by the administrator, an additional surety bond
                    for those having actual possession of or control over credit union funds or financial records. Since the administrator has broad discretion and authority under this section to prescribe rules "relating to financial records, business
                    practices and the conduct and management of credit unions," the administrator can promulgate reasonable guidelines for boards of directors to follow in determining the "amount and character" of the bond to be required. However, it
                    is not within the discretion of a board of directors or the administrator to determine who shall be covered by the bond, other than to identify "persons handling credit union funds or records." See opinion of Attorney General to Mr.
                    Stanley W. Brown, Jr., Deputy Administrator, Credit Union Division, Department of Commerce, 59 N.C.A.G. 8 (1989).

                        Legislative Intent as to "Common Bond" Requirement. - The clear legislative intent of this section is to invest the credit union incorporators with the prerogative to establish and describe the "common bond" of its members within the bounds of the three
                        permissible groups described in subsection (b) of this section. North Carolina Sav. &amp; Loan League v. North Carolina Credit Union Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 262 S.E.2d 361 (1980),
                        rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 458</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 404 (1981).

                    <p>
                        To qualify as a common bond within the meaning of this section, which provides that all persons eligible for membership in a credit union must share one and the same common bond, the trait or factor must be common to all eligible membership, and its very
                        nature must provide the assurance of stability. North Carolina Sav. &amp; Loan League v. North Carolina Credit Union Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 458</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 404 (1981).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        County, Municipal and State Employees. - Because county, municipal and State employees do not all engage in similar types of work with similar job descriptions, they do not share a common bond of similar occupation, since similarity in occupation means
                        similarity in the actual work done rather than similarity in who is benefited and who pays; therefore, an amendment to the bylaws of the State Employees' Credit Union permitting an expansion of the field of membership to include
                        certain county and municipal employees could not be upheld on this basis. North Carolina Sav. &amp; Loan League v. North Carolina Credit Union Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 458</cite>, 276 S.E.2d
                        404 (1981).

                    <p>
                        The class of persons eligible for membership in the State Employees' Credit Union under an amendment to the bylaws of the credit union permitting an expansion of the field of membership to include certain county and municipal employees did not possess
                        the common bond of similar association or interest, and limitation of membership to governmental employees covered under a State administered retirement system did not provide a common bond of similar interest. North Carolina Sav.

                    unless we have agreed with the credit union that withdrawals require more than one signature; and 2. Upon the death of one joint owner the money remaining in the account will belong to the surviving joint owners and will not pass by
                    inheritance to the heirs of the deceased joint owner or be controlled by the deceased joint owner's will. We DO elect to create the right of survivorship in this account. ____________________________________________________________

        Attempt to Create Security Interest in Retirement Account by Using Deceptive Trade Practices.
       </b> - Practices and actions of credit union in deceiving borrower into thinking that credit union had a valid, enforceable security interest in his retirement account by inserting the word "retirement" in the "other collateral"
                        block on front of loan documents and having debtor sign documents at time of making first loan (which authorized sending employee's retirement checks to credit union and depositing therein and filing away of these forms and applying
                        them to all loans thereafter made) violated public policy of protecting the retirement accounts of teachers and other state employees, having tendency to deceive them regarding their rights as to their retirement accounts. These
                        acts collectively constitute unfair and deceptive trade practices. As debtor was damaged as a result of such practices (in that he lost ability to use his retirement fund for his own needs, including eventual retirement), he was
                        entitled to recover treble damages and attorneys' fees. Petersen v. State Employees Credit Union (In re Kittrell), 115 Bankr. 873 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1990).

                    The board of directors must call a special meeting of the members residing in that district to consider the removal of the director. By a vote of the majority of that district, the director in question shall be removed from office:
                    Provided, that this section shall not apply to directors appointed under subsection (b) of G.S. 54-146.

                            Right of Member to Place Lien on Crop. - A member of a cooperative association may place a mortgage or crop lien on his crop for the current year for the purpose of enabling him to successfully cultivate and produce the same, where the contract between
                            the parties clearly contemplates such a mortgage, and good policy requires that such a privilege should never be withdrawn. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 252</cite>,
                            121 S.E. 631 (1924).

                            Rights of Lienholder Who Furnishes Supplies. - The mortgagee or lienholder for supplies furnished to an association member to produce his crop has a right to demand and receive of the member, or to enforce delivery by any appropriate procedure, a sufficient
                            amount of the crop or other property included in his mortgage, to satisfy his claims to the extent that the same constitute a valid lien superior to the rights and interests of the association under its contract. If such a
                            lien and the amount and extent of it cannot be agreed upon and adjusted it would seem that the lien claimant should become or be made a party of record, that authoritative and final disposition should be made of the matter.

                            Liability of Member for Act of Nonmember Tenant. - The member of a cooperative association is not liable for a penalty on account of the failure of his tenant to market tobacco through the association until and unless he receives the tenant's crop as
                            payment for rent, etc. He is then liable for as much as is received. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Bissett, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 180</cite>, 121 S.E. 446 (1924).

                            Validity of Tobacco Growers' Contract. - The provisions of the standard contract made by the Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, formed under the provisions of this Subchapter, whereby a member agreed to sell and deliver to it all of the tobacco
                            owned and produced by or for him or acquired by him as landlord or lessor during certain years, were valid and enforceable. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 265</cite>,

                            Validity Of Marketing Contract. - Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a tobacco cooperative stabilization corporation in a restraint of trade claim brought by various tobacco warehouses because the corporation's creation of market centers
                            subsidizing warehouse operations fell within an exemption of North Carolina's antitrust laws under G.S. 54-141 and the resultant marketing contracts were permissible under G.S. 54-152(a). Bailey v. Flue-Cured Tobacco Coop.

                            Avoiding Contract for Fraud. - In order to render void for fraud in its procurement a tobacco marketing contract made in conformity with the provisions of this section, it is required that the member seeking to do so must introduce evidence of the fraud
                            he relies on, as well as allege it. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Chilton, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 602</cite>, 130 S.E. 312 (1925); Simpson v. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 603</cite>,

                        <p>
                            In order to avoid a written contract, made under this section, for fraudulent misrepresentations of the association's agent, it must not only be shown that the statements complained of were false, but that the plaintiff was at the time ignorant of their
                            falsity and relied thereon to his damage, and he must show facts sufficient to make out a case of fraud with all the material elements required in such instances. Simpson v. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n,
                            <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 603</cite>, 130 S.E. 507 (1925).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where an agent of a cooperative association falsely represents to a prospective member certain material advantages that induce him to sign the membership contract, without affording him, an illiterate man, an opportunity to become informed as to its contents,
                            and he, within a reasonable time afterwards, is informed of this misrepresentation, and requests the agent to take his name off the books as a member and cancel the contract, the law will avoid the contract for the fraud. The
                            cases in which the representations were only promissory in character, not amounting to a factual representation, do not apply. Dunbar v. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 608</cite>,

                            Remedies for Breach of Contract by Member. - Upon the breach by a member of a cooperative association of a contract for the sole handling of his crop by the association, the recovery of liquidated damages and costs, and equitable relief by injunction
                            to prevent the further breach of the contract, and a decree of specific performance, can be had, and also pending the adjudication of such actions, a temporary restraining order may be had against the member upon the filing
                            of a verified complaint showing the breach of the contract, with the filing of sufficient bond. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 265</cite>, 117 S.E. 174 (1923).

                        <p>
                            Liquidated Damages. - The fact that a cooperative marketing contract provides for liquidated damages does not give the association an adequate remedy at law against the members selling their tobacco otherwise than as provided in the marketing contract.
                            Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Pollock, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 409</cite>, 121 S.E. 763 (1924).

                        <p>
                            Specific Performance. - Injuries from the breach of marketing contract by a member with the Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, formed under the provisions of this Subchapter, cannot be adequately compensated for in damages, and the equitable remedy
                            of specific performance as allowed by this section will be upheld by the courts. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Battle, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 260</cite>, 121 S.E. 629 (1924).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Injunctive Relief. - Upon an alleged breach of a cooperative marketing contract on the part of a member, the equitable remedy by injunction is available to the association. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 252</cite>,
                            121 S.E. 631 (1924).

                        <p>
                            Continuation of Injunction to Final Hearing. - The right given to injunctive relief against a member breaching his contract, upon filing the bond and verified complaint showing such breach, or threatened breach, relates only to the initial process and
                            does not, and is not, intended to withdraw from the courts their constitutional right to pass upon the question of continuing the injunction to the final hearing upon the issues, under approved principles of law and equity.
                            Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Bland, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 356</cite>, 121 S.E. 636 (1924).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where defendant member has admitted breaking his contract with the association, and avows that he expects to continue doing so, a temporary injunction should be continued until the final hearing. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Patterson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 252</cite>, 121 S.E. 631 (1924).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the defendant resists injunctive relief upon the ground that he had not become a member, and the plaintiff's evidence tends strongly to show to the contrary, the injunction should be continued to the hearing upon the principle that the plaintiff
                            has established an apparent right to the relief sought, and that the writ is reasonably necessary to protect the property pending the inquiry. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Battle, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 260</cite>,
                            121 S.E. 629 (1924); Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Spikes, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 367</cite>, 121 S.E. 636 (1924).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defenses to Continuance of Restraining Order. - The general denial by a cooperative marketing association of owing defendant member anything under the contract, without detailed statement as to the account between them from information available to it,
                            was insufficient against the defense to continuation of a restraining order that the defendant was forced to sell a small portion of crop to maintain his livelihood because of a failure of the association to pay for bulk of
                            crop under contract. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Bland, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 356</cite>, 121 S.E. 636 (1924).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A preliminary order restraining a member of a cooperative association from disposing of the tobacco embraced in his contract in breach thereof will not be dissolved by reason of a defense set up by the member that the tobacco was the subject of a lien
                            for supplies necessary for its cultivation. The restraining order should be continued to the hearing, safeguarding the rights of the mortgagee to be asserted by his appropriate action. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Patterson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 252</cite>, 121 S.E. 631 (1924).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The temporary restraining order obtained under the provisions of this section will not be continued if the breach of the contract complained of was caused by the association's own default, or if the continuance of the temporary restraining order will
                            work greater injury than its dissolution by the court. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Bland, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 356</cite>, 121 S.E. 636 (1924).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Effect of Lien on Right to Injunction. - The fact that the member of a cooperative association gave a lien on his crop for advancements does not invade the rights of the association under the marketing contract so as to require that an injunction against
                            selling the crops should be continued until the final hearing. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Harvey &amp; Son Co., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 494</cite>, 127 S.E. 545 (1925).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Justification for Breach Shown by Parol. - Where a member of a cooperative marketing association resists the performance of marketing his crop with the association under the usual and written contract, he may show by parol that he had never been a member
                            thereof or obligated by the contract sued on, for the failure of the association to obtain a certain membership within the territory. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 421</cite>,
                            121 S.E. 738 (1924).

                        <p>
                            Lack of Justification for Breach by Member. - A penalty in a small sum erroneously attempted to be imposed on a member by a marketing association, under its contract for the failure to market the crop of his nonmember tenant, is not of sufficient proportionate
                            importance to justify an entire severance of the contract relation by the member thereof. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Bland, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 356</cite>, 121 S.E. 636 (1924).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evasive Answer of Member Respecting Breach. - In proceedings for injunctive relief by a cooperative marketing association against a member wherein it definitely alleges that the defendant has breached his contract and declares his purpose to dispose of
                            his tobacco in breach thereof, the defendant's answer not admitting the allegations, but demanding strict proof, is too evasive or illusive to be a denial of plaintiff's allegation, or received as sufficient evidence upon the
                            question of injunctive relief. Tobacco Growers Coop. Ass'n v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 252</cite>, 121 S.E. 631 (1924).

                        Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section, no member of an association effecting a merger or consolidation, who objects thereto and makes written demand for payment of the fair market value of his stock or other property rights or
                        interests in the association, as hereinbefore provided in this section, shall be entitled to such payment at any time prior to the time that he would otherwise be entitled to payment pursuant to valid provisions of such stock,
                        or valid provisions of the charter or the bylaws of the association, in effect on the date of the vote for such merger or consolidation. However, in any case where the owner of such stock or other property rights or interests in
                        the association is not entitled, because of valid provisions of his stock, or because of valid provisions of the charter or bylaws of the association, to payment at the time hereinbefore provided in this section, the fair market
                        value of such stock or other property rights or interests in the association, as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken, may be determined in any manner hereinbefore provided in this section, and the amount so
                        determined, without interest, shall be an obligation of the surviving or new association, as the case may be, and shall be due and payable at the time that the owner thereof would be entitled to payment pursuant to valid provisions
                        of such stock, or valid provisions of the charter or the bylaws of the association.
