                        Leasing Office Space Not a Fund-Raising Expense. - To "solicit" under the former Charitable Solicitation Licensure Act included oral and written requests, announcements through the press, television, or telephone, distribution and circulation of handbills

                        Unconstitutionally Overbroad. - North Carolina's licensure procedure, as it read prior to the 1989 amendment to the former Charitable Solicitation Licensure Act, infringed upon the rights protected by U.S. Const., Amend. I, of those organizations which,
                        for various reasons, had to rely on professional solicitors. The fact that (1) the licensure process was subject to North Carolina's Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 150B), and (2) licenses had in the past been considered
                        expeditiously was not enough to save the statute. National Fed'n of Blind of N.C. Inc. v. Riley, 635 F. Supp. 256 (E.D.N.C. 1986), aff'd, 817 F.2d 102 (4th Cir. 1987), aff'd, 817 F.2d 102 (4th Cir. 1987), 487 U.S. 781, 108 S. Ct.

        The licensing requirement of former G.S. 131C-6, as it read prior to the 1989 amendment, as to professional fundraisers was unconstitutional.
       </b> A speaker's rights were not lost merely because compensation was received, and the State's asserted power to license professional fundraisers carried with it (unless properly constrained) the power directly and substantially
                        to affect the speech they uttered. Consequently, the statute was subject to scrutiny under U.S. Const., Amend. I. Riley v. National Fed'n of Blind of N.C. Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 108 S. Ct. 2667, 101 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1988).

        Generally, speakers need not obtain a license to speak.
       </b> Even assuming that the State's interest in regulating those who solicit money justifies requiring fundraisers to obtain a license before soliciting, such a regulation must provide that the licensor will, within a specified
                        brief period, either issue a license or go to court. That requirement was not met in former G.S. 131C-6, for that section permitted a delay without limit. Riley v. National Fed'n of Blind of N.C. Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 108 S. Ct.

                        The purpose of the bond requirement of former G.S. 131C-10 was to protect those who had made charitable contributions; the bond was not meant to be used to satisfy obligations on a lease which was already in default at the time the bond was issued. Kirkland
