                    of county commissioners. In no event is the fee charged to exceed the cost to the board of social services. Fee policies may not conflict with rules and regulations adopted by the Social Services Commission or Department of Health

                        The sole involvement of the county board of social services in personnel matters is to select the county director of social services. And the director derives his authority to appoint personnel directly from the General Assembly, not from the board. Thus
                        the local board does not become the "local appointing authority" pursuant to G.S. 126-37 (now repealed) in the absence of a permanent full-time director. In re Brunswick County, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                        391, 344 S.E.2d 584 (1986).

                        Department of Human Resources Liable for Acts of County Director Negligently Placing Foster Child. - In an action alleging that a foster child was negligently placed in a home by the Durham County Department of Social Services, the Department of Human
                        Resources would be liable for the negligent acts of its agents, the Durham County Director of Social Services and his subordinates, since the Department of Human Resources, through the Social Services Commission has the right to

                        a director of social services were acting as public officials and could therefore not be held individually liable in a case alleging negligent placement of a foster child. Hobbs v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources,

                        to exercise discretion in that capacity, that is, in the capacity of a social worker; thus, where a social worker took various actions in the social worker's capacity as a social worker for a county human services agency that clearly
                        required the exercise of discretion and were not simply ministerial, the social worker was considered a public official for purposes of public official immunity. Dalenko v.

                        Juvenile Petition for Termination of Parental Rights. - Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the juvenile petition filed by the caseworker even though the caseworker did not sign it and, thus, the trial court could enter its termination of
                        parental rights order regarding the father; while the caseworker did not specifically state in the petition that the caseworker was an authorized representative of the director of the Department of Social Services, the caseworker's
                        verification of the petition was sufficient for the trial court to exercise jurisdiction over the case. In re D.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 654 S.E.2d 1 (2007).

        Recoupment of Overpayments
       </b> - Where North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance (DMA) sought to recoup Medicaid overpayments made to a debtor hospital, in order to qualify for recoupment, the DMA's recoupment
                        claim was required to have arisen from the "same transaction" as the overpayment; the bankruptcy court found that the ongoing stream of services, advances, and reconciliations that was unique to the Medicaid system constituted
                        a single transaction for recoupment purposes, and although the relationship between the hospital and the DMA involved several transactions for the provision of services to several patients, this relationship was not analogous to
                        multiple, separate equipment purchases from a single supplier, which would not have been part of the same transaction. In re Dist. Mem'l Hosp. of Southwestern N.C. Inc., 297 B.R. 451 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. 2002).

                        Decision Rationally Related to Goal of Statute. - There was no substantive due process right violated in the trial court's decision to affirm the decision of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, (DHHS)
                        to decertify a corporation as a provider of HIV case management services because the trial court perceived that the corporation's lack of proper progress notes prevented DHHS from being able to accurately account for funds allotted
                        by the Division of Medical Services for the program of public assistance, and given that the problem was evident in all four case managers at the corporation, decertification would ensure that funds provided for public assistance
                        would be protected; the trial court's decision was rationally related to the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-25ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 108A-25(b)</a></cite> goal of providing a program of public

      </b> - Session Laws 2009-451, s. 10.57(a)-(e), provides: "The eligibility of Special Assistance recipients residing in adult care homes on August 1, 1995, shall not be affected by an income reduction in the Special Assistance
                    eligibility criteria resulting from adoption of the Rate Setting Methodology Report and Related Services, providing these recipients are otherwise eligible. The maximum monthly rate for these residents in adult care home facilities
                    shall be one thousand two hundred thirty-one dollars ($1,231) per month per resident.

                    this section. The eligibility of Special Assistance recipients residing in adult care homes on September 30, 2009, shall not be affected by an income reduction in the Special Assistance eligibility criteria resulting from the adoption

                <p>
                    "Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Department of Health and Human Services shall review activities and costs related to the provision of care in adult care homes and shall determine what costs may be considered to properly maximize
                    allowable reimbursement available through Medicaid personal care services for adult care homes (ACH-PCS) under federal law. As determined, and with any necessary approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and
                    the approval of the Office of State Budget and Management, the Department may transfer necessary funds from the State-County Special Assistance program within the Division of Social Services to the Division of Medical Assistance and
                    may use those funds as State match to draw down federal matching funds to pay for such activities and costs under Medicaid's personal care services for adult care homes (ACH-PCS), thus maximizing available federal funds. The established
                    rate for State-County Special Assistance set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be adjusted by the Department to reflect any transfer of funds from the Division of Social Services to the Division of Medical Assistance
                    and related transfer costs and responsibilities from State-County Special Assistance to the Medicaid personal care services for adult care homes (ACH-PCS). Subject to approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
                    and prior to implementing this section, the Department may disregard a limited amount of income for individuals whose countable income exceeds the adjusted State-County Special Assistance rate. The amount of the disregard shall not
                    exceed the difference between the Special Assistance rate prior to the adjustment and the Special Assistance rate after the adjustment and shall be used to pay a portion of the cost of the ACH-PCS and reduce the Medicaid payment for
                    the individual's personal care services provided in an adult care home. In no event shall the reimbursement for services through the ACH-PCS exceed the average cost of the services as determined by the Department from review of cost
                    reports as required and submitted by adult care homes. The Department shall report any transfers of funds and modifications of rates to the House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, the Senate
                    Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services, and the Fiscal Research Division.

                <p>
                    Tiered Rate Structure Pilot Program. - Session Laws 2013-360, s. 12D.2(a)-(e), provides: "(a) As used in this section, the term 'group home' means any facility that (i) is licensed under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122C</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes, (ii) meets the definition of a supervised living facility under 10A NCAC 27G.5601(c)(1) or 10A NCAC 27G.5601(c)(3), and (iii) serves adults whose primary diagnosis is mental illness or a developmental disability
                    but may also have other diagnoses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a State-County Special Assistance program that allows counties greater flexibility in serving individual needs within their communities and greater control over how county funds are used to support
                    this program in light of the fact that counties are required to pay for fifty percent (50%) of the costs of this program. To that end, the General Assembly directs the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a pilot program
                    in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(c) The Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Aging and Adult Services (Department), shall establish a pilot program to implement a tiered rate structure within the State-County Special Assistance program for individuals residing in group
                    homes, in-home living arrangements, and assisted living residences as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131D.html#t131Da01s131D-2.1" target="_blank">G.S. 131D-2.1</a></cite>. The purposes
                    of the pilot program are to (i) determine the best way to implement a block grant for this program statewide and (ii) test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a tiered rate structure to address program participants' intensity
                    of need, including medication management. The Department shall select a minimum of four and a maximum of six counties to participate in the pilot program, at least two of which shall be rural counties and at least two of which shall
                    be urban counties. The pilot program shall (i) be implemented during the 2013-2014 fiscal year, (ii) operate for at least a 12-month period, and (iii) comply with any agreements in effect between the State of North Carolina and the
                    United States government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(d) The Department shall implement the pilot program in collaboration with the local departments of social services in the counties selected for participation. As part of the pilot program, the selected counties shall receive a State General Fund allocation
                    as a block grant to be equally matched with county general funds. The General Fund allocation provided to each county participating in the pilot program shall be calculated based upon the average annual Special Assistance expenditures
                    for that county during the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium, adjusted for the amount of projected annual growth in the number of Special Assistance recipients in that county during the 2013-2015 fiscal biennium. These funds may be used to
                    pay for room, board, and personal care services, including medication management, for individuals eligible to receive State-County Special Assistance, subject to the following limitations and requirements:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) These funds shall not be used to cover any portion of the cost of providing services for which an individual receives Medicaid coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) The pilot program shall comply with all federal and State requirements governing the existing State-County Special Assistance program, except that Section 12D.3 does not apply to the pilot program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) The tiered rate structure shall be based upon intensity of need, and an individual's placement within a tier shall be based upon an independent assessment of the individual's need for room, board, and assistance with activities of daily living, including
                    medication management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(e) By February 1, 2014, the Department shall submit a progress report on the implementation and operation of the pilot program, including any obstacles to implementation; and by February 1, 2015, the Department shall submit a final report on the results
                    of the pilot program, along with any recommendations based on these results, to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services and the Fiscal Research Division. The report due by February 1, 2015, shall include
                    information from all participating counties on at least all of the following:
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    "(2) The cost methodology for determining these tiered rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) The number of individuals participating in the pilot program while residing in a group home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) The number of individuals participating in the pilot program while residing in an in-home living arrangement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) The number of individuals participating in the pilot program while residing in an assisted living residence as defined by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131D.html#t131Da01s131D-2.1" target="_blank">G.S. 131D-2.1</a></cite>,

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) Any other information the Department deems relevant for determining the best way to implement a block grant statewide for the State-County Special Assistance program."

                        were in essence a continuing act to reach her desired result: obtain food stamps in an amount for which she would not have been otherwise qualified. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite>                        412, 399 S.E.2d 348 (1991).

                        form to a supervisor at the Department of Social Services was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for food stamp fraud. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 748 S.E.2d

                    cases commenced by Medicaid applicants or recipients under subsection 10.15A(h1) of this act. Except as otherwise provided by subsection 10.15A(h1) and this subsection governing time lines and procedural steps, a contested Medicaid
                    case commenced by a Medicaid applicant or recipient is subject to the provisions of Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite>. To the extent any
                    provision in this subsection or subsection 10.15A(h1) of this act conflicts with another provision in Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite>, this subsection and

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Simple Procedures. - Notwithstanding any other provision of Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes, the chief administrative law judge
                    may limit and simplify the procedures that apply to a contested Medicaid case involving a Medicaid applicant or recipient in order to complete the case as quickly as possible. To the extent possible, the Office of Administrative Hearings
                    shall schedule and hear all contested Medicaid cases within 55 days of submission of a request for appeal. Hearings shall be conducted telephonically or by video technology, however the recipient or applicant, or the recipient's or
                    applicant's representative may request that the hearing be conducted before the administrative law judge in person. An in-person hearing shall be conducted in Wake County, however for good cause shown, the in-person hearing may be
                    conducted in the county of residence of the recipient or applicant. Good cause shall include but is not limited to the applicant's or recipient's impairments limiting travel or the unavailability of the applicant's or recipient's treating
                    professional witnesses. The Department shall provide written notice to the recipient or applicant of the use of telephonic hearings, hearings by video conference, and in-person hearings before the administrative law judge, and how
                    to request a hearing in the recipient's or applicant's county of residence. The simplified procedure may include requiring that all prehearing motions be considered and ruled on by the administrative law judge in the course of the
                    hearing of the case on the merits. An administrative law judge assigned to a contested Medicaid case shall make reasonable efforts in a case involving a Medicaid applicant or recipient who is not represented by an attorney to assure
                    a fair hearing and to maintain a complete record of the hearing. The administrative law judge may allow brief extensions of the time limits contained in this section for good cause and to ensure that the record is complete. Good cause
                    includes delays resulting from untimely receipt of documentation needed to render a decision and other unavoidable and unforeseen circumstances. Continuances shall only be granted in accordance with rules adopted by the Office of Administrative
                    Hearings, and shall not be granted on the day of the hearing, except for good cause shown. If a petitioner fails to make an appearance at a hearing that has been properly noticed via certified mail by the Office of Administrative Hearings,
                    the Office of Administrative Hearings shall immediately dismiss the contested case provision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) Mediation. - Upon receipt of an appeal request form as provided by subdivision 10.15A(h1)(4) of this act or other clear request for a hearing by a Medicaid applicant or recipient, the Office of Administrative Hearings shall immediately notify the
                    Mediation Network of North Carolina which shall within five days contact the petitioner to offer mediation in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If mediation is accepted, the mediation must be completed within 25 days of submission
                    of the request for appeal. Upon completion of the mediation, the mediator shall inform the Office of Administrative Hearings and the Department within 24 hours of the resolution by facsimile or electronic messaging. If the parties
                    have resolved matters in the mediation, the case shall be dismissed by the Office of Administrative Hearings. The Office of Administrative Hearings shall not conduct any contested Medicaid cases hearings until it has received notice
                    from the mediator assigned that either: (i) the mediation was unsuccessful, or (ii) the petitioner has rejected the offer of mediation, or (iii) the petitioner has failed to appear at a scheduled mediation. Nothing in this subdivision
                    shall restrict the right to a contested case hearing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Burden of Proof. - The petitioner has the burden of proof to show entitlement to a requested benefit or the propriety of requested agency action when the agency has denied the benefit or refused to take the particular action. The agency has the burden
                    of proof when the appeal is from an agency determination to impose a penalty or reduce, terminate, or suspend a benefit previously granted. The party with the burden of proof on any issue has the burden of going forward, and the administrative
                    law judge shall not make any ruling on the preponderance of evidence until the close of all evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4a) New Evidence. - The petitioner shall be permitted to submit evidence regardless of whether obtained prior to or subsequent to the Department's actions and regardless of whether the Department had an opportunity to consider the evidence in making
                    its determination to deny, reduce, terminate or suspend a benefit. When such evidence is received, at the request of the Department, the administrative law judge shall continue the hearing for a minimum of 15 days and a maximum of
                    30 days to allow for the Department's review of the evidence. Subsequent to review of the evidence, if the Department reverses its original decision, it shall immediately inform the administrative law judge.

                <p>
                    "(4b) Issue for Hearing. - For each penalty imposed or benefit reduced, terminated, or suspended, the hearing shall determine whether the Department substantially prejudiced the rights of the petitioner and if the Department, based upon evidence at the
                    hearing:
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) Decision. - The administrative law judge assigned to a contested Medicaid case shall hear and decide the case without unnecessary delay. The Office of Administrative Hearings shall send a copy of the audiotape or diskette of the hearing to the agency
                    within five days of completion of the hearing. The judge shall prepare a written decision and send it to the parties. The decision must be sent together with the record to the agency within 20 days of the conclusion of the hearing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(h3) From funds available to the Department of Health and Human Services for the 2008-2009 fiscal year, the sum of two million dollars ($2,000,000) shall be transferred by the Department of Health and Human Services to the Office of Administrative Hearings.
                    These funds shall be allocated by the Office of Administrative Hearings for mediation services provided for Medicaid applicant and recipient appeals and to contract for other services necessary to conduct the appeals process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(h4) Effective October 1, 2008, the Department of Health and Human Services shall discontinue its current informal appeals process for Medicaid applicants and recipients appealing a determination made by the Department to deny, terminate, suspend, or
                    reduce Medicaid covered services. All such informal appeals by Medicaid applicants or recipients under the current system which are pending on that date and for which a hearing has not been held shall be discontinued and the applicant
                    or recipient offered an opportunity to appeal to the Office of Administrative Hearings in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10.15A(h1) of this act. The Department shall make every effort to resolve or settle all of the backlogged
                    cases prior to the effective date of this act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(h5) Nothing in this act shall prevent the Department of Health and Human Services from engaging in an informal review of the case with the applicant or recipient prior to issuing a notice of adverse determination as provided by subsection 10.15A(h1)
                    of this act.

                    for the delivery of services for individuals with mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders through expansion of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. It is the intent of the General Assembly
                    that expansion of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver will be completed by July 1, 2013, and will result in the establishment of a system that is capable of managing all public resources that may become available for mental health, intellectual
                    and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services, including federal block grant funds, federal funding for Medicaid and Health Choice, and all other public funding sources. In implementing the restructuring and expansion

                        ALJ and trial court had jurisdiction to hear a Medicaid provider's contest to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS) decision that the provider received an overpayment, despite the provider's failure to appeal that decision
                        within 60 days of receiving a private contractor's tentative notice of overpayment (TNO), because the TNO did not begin the time for appealing an administrative decision as DHHS could not delegate the discretionary authority to
                        decide how to dispose of the issue to the private contractor as (1) DHHS was the state's single state agency authorized to make such decisions, and (2) the TNO stated a "final decision" would be reached in the future, so the TNO
                        did not inform the provider of DHHS's final decision on the matter, which initiated the appeal time. N.C. HHS v. Parker Home Care, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 551, 784 S.E.2d 552 (2016),

                    of military service and the dependent meets Medicaid eligibility criteria and all other waiver eligibility criteria upon returning to North Carolina. Consequently, a dependent who is on the waiting list for a waiver slot shall maintain
                    the dependent's position on the waiting list. A dependent who was receiving waiver services prior to the service member's transfer, upon the dependent's return to North Carolina, shall be reinstated to the dependent's waiver slot,

                        Subdivision of County May Not Be Subrogated to Its Rights. - A county department of social services may not recover by subrogation under this section, since that right inheres only in the county involved, not such county department. Malloy v. Durham County
                        Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 293 S.E.2d 285 (1982), decided under former G.S. 108-61.2

                        Evidence of a Collateral Benefit. - In tort actions, evidence of a collateral benefit is improper when the plaintiff will not receive a double recovery. Because Medicaid provides for a right of subrogation in the State to recover sums paid to plaintiffs,
                        this principle is applicable thereto. Cates v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 1</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 734 (1987).

                        Subrogation Rights. - The plain language of this section does not provide that the State is subrogated to all rights of recovery to the extent of all money a medical assistance beneficiary receives, only that the State is subrogated to all rights of recovery
                        of the beneficiary of medical assistance to the extent of payments under the entitled Medical Assistance Program. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources v.

                        When a minor recipient of Medicaid benefits settled medical negligence claims with health care providers, equitable subrogation principles did not apply to the right of the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance, to a
                        share of the settlement, because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-57ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 108A-57(a)</a></cite> specifically provided that the State "shall be subrogated to all rights of recovery,"

                        the settlements subject to the one-third limitation outlined within the statute; moreover, the payor's claim was properly characterized as a lien, and although the trial court improperly labelled the payor as a "beneficiary," that
                        was harmless error. Andrews v. Haygood, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 244, 655 S.E.2d 440 (2008), aff'd, review improvidently allowed, in part, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 599</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 310 (2008).

                        Minor Qualified As "Beneficiary". - Where the North Carolina Department of Human Resources, Division of Medical Assistance (DMA), expended Medicaid funds to pay medical care providers for services to an injured party, the injured party qualified as a
                        "beneficiary" of medical assistance benefits within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-57" target="_self">G.S. 108A-57</a></cite> for purposes of the DMA's right of subrogation to
                        the injured party's settlement from a tortfeasor even though the injured party was a minor at the time that the benefits were paid; under the statute's plain meaning, a "beneficiary" includes one who receives benefits and there
                        is no requirement that a "beneficiary" has to be one who has received a direct cash payment or relief from debt, or one who has the legal right to sue for medical benefits. Campbell v. N.C. Dep't of Human Res., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite>                        305, 569 S.E.2d 670 (2002).

A minor's share of the proceeds
                        of a malpractice settlement therefore was not shielded from the state's reimbursement claim by virtue of minority. E.M.A. v. Cansler, 674 F.3d 290 (4th Cir. 2012).

                        Action Subject to Abatement. - Because a family's federal lawsuit seeking a determination that the State department of health and human services was not entitled to a lien on the proceeds of the family's medical malpractice settlement against various
                        defendants involved the same parties, issues, and remedies as the department's action against the family, the trial court erred in denying the family's motion to abate the department's state court action. State HHS v. Armstrong,

                        controlled, and the State would be reimbursed the lesser of the state's past medical expenditures or one-third of the plaintiff's total recovery; by limiting the state's subrogation right to one-third of a Medicaid recipient's
                        recovery, the scheme protected a plaintiff's interests while promoting efficiency in Medicaid reimbursement cases throughout North Carolina. Armstrong v. Cansler, 722 F. Supp. 2d 653 (W.D.N.C. June 28, 2010), vacated 674 F.3d 290,

                        expenses. In the event of a lump-sum settlement, the sum certain allocable to medical expenses must be determined, in the absence of a stipulation by the affected parties, by judicial determination or some similar adversarial process.

                        Injured Party Was a "Recipient" of Medical Assistance Despite Being a Minor When Benefits Were Paid. - Where the North Carolina Department of Human Resources, Division of Medical Assistance, expended Medicaid funds to pay certain medical care providers
                        for services that they had rendered to an injured party, the injured party qualified as a "recipient" of medical assistance benefits within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-24" target="_self">G.S. 108A-24(5)</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-59" target="_self">G.S. 108A-59</a></cite> even though the injured party was a minor at the time that the benefits were paid; there was no requirement that a "recipient" had to be
                        one who had received a direct cash payment or relief from debt, or one who had the legal right to sue for medical benefits. Campbell v. N.C. Dep't of Human Res., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 569 S.E.2d 670 (2002).

                        With respect to a minor who is both a "recipient" and a "beneficiary" of medical assistance, the North Carolina third-party liability statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-57ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 108A-57(a)</a></cite>                        and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-59ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 108A-59(a)</a></cite>, by their plain language abrogate the common law rule that a minor cannot recover for medical expenses. A minor's share of the proceeds
                        of a malpractice settlement therefore was not shielded from the state's reimbursement claim by virtue of minority. E.M.A. v. Cansler, 674 F.3d 290 (4th Cir. 2012).

                        and did not err in subrogating the settlements subject to the one-third limitation outlined within the statute; moreover, the payor's claim was properly characterized as a lien, and although the trial court improperly labelled
                        the payor as a "beneficiary," that was harmless error. Andrews v. Haygood, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 244, 655 S.E.2d 440 (2008), aff'd, review improvidently allowed, in part, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 599</cite>,

      </b> - Session Laws 2010-31, s. 10.26(a)-(e), provides: "(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (Department) is authorized to create a fraud prevention program that uses information, lawfully obtained, from State and
                    private databases to develop a fraud risk analysis of Medicaid providers and recipients. This analysis would be used to prevent fraud before it takes place and to achieve cost avoidance savings. For the purposes of the fraud prevention
                    program created pursuant to this subsection, State agencies shall provide the Department with access to their databases, and the Department shall comply with all necessary security measures and restrictions to ensure that access to
                    any specific information held confidential under federal and State law is limited to authorized persons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) The information obtained by the Department pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be privileged and confidential, is not a public record pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.132.html#t132s132-1" target="_blank">G.S. 132-1</a></cite>,

                    The Dashboard shall be continuously updated to allow for monitoring by State leadership, staff and families involved in the social services system, and the general public to ensure maximum accountability and transparency and the effective
                    and efficient use of social services and funds. The Department of Health and Human Services shall work closely with the organization to identify available data sources to include in the Dashboard for the relevant programs. With respect

                    Services system dated March 1, 2016, to ensure the provision of accurate federal reporting and improved case management, continuous quality improvement (CQI), and overall improved outcomes for children and families. The data from the
                    Dashboard shall be readily available on the Department's Web site. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Dashboard" means a standard set of performance and outcome metrics that indicate how effectively the components of the social
                    services system are working.

                        Due Process Rights Not Violated. - North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services violated a mother's due process and equal protection rights because although the hearing officer's final decision came some time after the hearing date, the mother's
                        children failed to take advantage of their statutory right to compel the hearing officer to take action; the children were afforded an adequate opportunity to have their concerns addressed in a timely manner, but merely failed
                        to take advantage of that right, and their equal protection rights were not violated by the hearing officer's delay. Cloninger v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 345, 691 S.E.2d 127

                    <p>
                        Failure to Give Notice of Right to Counsel. - The omission of information concerning the right to counsel in the notice of termination of services under subsection (c) was a serious error; lack of assistance of counsel could have a major impact on the
                        proceedings, and the notice fell short of the necessary specificity regarding the reasons for termination. King v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 376

                    <p>
                        Failure to Apprise Petitioner of Basis for Decision. - Use of the general language "continuing refusal to cooperate" did not sufficiently apprise the petitioner of the basis for the decision and seriously impaired his ability to rebut those grounds at
                        the subsequent hearing. King v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 376 S.E.2d 245 (1989).

                    <p>
                        Standing to Appeal Eligibility Decision. - Daughter of deceased Medicaid recipient had no right to appeal from Department of Human Resources decision regarding her father's eligibility, as she was neither an "applicant" nor a "recipient," nor the legal
                        representative of her father's estate. Yates v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 390 S.E.2d 761 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Standard of Review. - Superior court was required under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa04s108A-79ol1k" target="_self">G.S. 108A-79(k)</a></cite> to determine whether decisions by a hearing officer for the North Carolina Department
                        of Health and Human Services, regarding the denial of Medicaid emergency medical benefits for a claimant's hospitalizations, were factually and legally correct. Thus, the superior court properly made its own findings of fact, and
                        conducted a de novo review to the extent it was functioning as an appellate court. Meza v. Div. of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 668 S.E.2d 571 (2008), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 61</cite>,

                        The standard of review of an agency decision under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa04s108A-79ol1k" target="_self">G.S. 108A-79(k)</a></cite> is de novo when the superior court exercises its statutory authority to take testimony
                        and examine into the facts of the case to determine whether the final decision is in error under federal and State law. If, however, the superior court proceeds solely upon the administrative record, the hearing is governed by
                        the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba04s150B-51ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-51(b)</a></cite>, in which questions of fact are reviewed under the whole

                        Omission of Information Concerning Right to Counsel Was Error. - The omission of information concerning the right to counsel in the notice of termination of services under subsection (c) was a serious error; lack of assistance of counsel could have a
                        major impact on the proceedings, and the notice fell short of the necessary specificity regarding the reasons for termination; the general "continuing refusal to cooperate" does not sufficiently apprise the petitioner of the basis
                        for the decision and seriously impairs his ability to rebut those grounds at the subsequent hearing; therefore, plaintiff's benefits were improperly terminated by the failure to follow prescribed statutory requirements for notice.

                        Findings of Fact Inadequate. - Work First benefits recipient's appeal of the affirmance of a reduction of her benefits was remanded to the trial court as the trial court's findings of fact related to the recipient's diabetic condition and her ability
                        to work merely recited the evidence, did not articulate what the trial court considered to be the definition of disability in the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), specifically 42 U.S.C.S.
                        <span class="s1">
    §

                    <p>
                        Substantial Evidence Found. - Substantial competent evidence in the form of medical expert opinion supported a hearing officer's conclusion that a petitioner, a non-qualified alien, was entitled to Medicaid benefits for portions of two hospitalizations
                        because the petitioner's condition met the definition of an emergency medical condition, under 42 U.S.C.S.

                        Jurisdiction to Consider Whether Previous Order Was Being Violated. - Trial court had jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 70,
                        to decide whether its previous order was being violated where that order had determined that the Medicaid recipient was to continue to receive benefits under the categorically needy eligibility group until he was determined to
                        be ineligible under the rules as modified by that order, the decision to terminate his benefits under a program for which he appeared eligible squarely raised the issue of whether the agency had acted as a disobedient party, and
                        neither the APA nor <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa04s108A-79" target="_self">G.S. 108A-79</a></cite> provided for administrative review of the alleged violation of the court order. Pachas v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 12</cite>,

                        Provisions Governing Appeals. - Appeals by applicants and recipients of public assistance or social services from adverse decisions of county agencies or boards are governed by the substantive provisions and procedural requirements of this section, including
                        the procedural provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (G.S. 150B-1 et seq.), consistent with the statute, to the extent that substance and procedure are not in conflict with applicable federal law and regulations. See opinion
                        of Attorney General to Mr. Phillip J. Kirk, Jr., Secretary, Department of Human Resources, 55 N.C.A.G. 91 (1986).

        Substantive Provisions of Section Govern over Administrative Procedure Act.
       </b> - Given the detailed substantive provisions of this section, designed specifically to apply to appeals of county agency decisions, and the fact that the Administrative Procedure Act, by its terms, does not apply to
                        such appeals, the legislature, by reference to such act, did not intend to substitute the act's substantive requirements for those of this section. The citation to the act simply indicated a legislative intent to incorporate the
                        powers of hearing officers and the hearing procedures detailed in the act into subsection (i) of this section by reference. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Phillip J. Kirk, Jr., Secretary, Department of Human Resources,
