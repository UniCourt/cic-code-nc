      </i> ), as amended by Session Laws 2018-138, s. 2.5(a), (b), and, as amended by Session Laws 2018-141, s. 1-3, provides: "(a) The General Assembly finds that:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) The historic flood and other impacts of Hurricane Florence in September of 2018 caused unprecedented damage to the State and its people, with particular devastating statewide impacts on North Carolina farmers and the State's agriculture industry.

                <p>
                    "(2) The State has over 50,000 farms across over 8 million acres, which generates 87 billion dollars of economic impact annually and represents the State's number one industry, making it a vital component to a healthy state economy.

                <p>
                    "(3) The total loss of crops as a result of the flooding is estimated at over a billion dollars and the estimated federal crop insurance payments will only cover a percentage of the total crop loss.

                    "(4) The federal crop insurance program as authorized in the 2014 Farm Bill is an inadequate method of indemnification as compared to traditional forms of insurance and is not sufficient to aid farmers with substantial losses due to catastrophic events

                    taxes, interest, and penalties shall be those provided in this Article, as now or hereinafter amended or supplemented. If any third person claims any intangible attached or garnished hereunder and his lawful right thereto, or to any
                    part thereof, is shown to the Commissioner, he shall discharge the attachment or garnishment to the extent necessary to protect such right, and if such right is asserted after the filing of said copies as aforesaid, it may be established
                    by interpleader as now or hereafter provided by the General Statutes in cases of attachment and garnishment. In case such third party has no notice of proceedings hereunder, he shall have the right to file his petition under oath with
                    the Commissioner at any time within 12 months after said intangible is paid to him and if the Commissioner finds that such party is lawfully entitled thereto or to any part thereof, he shall pay the same to such party as provided for
                    refunds by G.S. 105-407 and if such payment is denied, said party may appeal from the determination of the Commissioner to the Superior Court of Wake County or to the superior court of the county wherein he resides or does business.
                    The intangibles of a taxpayer shall be paid or collected hereunder only to the extent necessary to satisfy said fees or taxes, interest, penalties, and costs. Except as hereinafter set forth, the remedy provided in this section shall
                    not be resorted to unless a warrant for collection or execution against the taxpayer has been returned unsatisfied: Provided, however, if the Commissioner is of opinion that the only effective remedy is that herein provided, it shall
                    not be necessary that a warrant for collection or execution shall be first returned unsatisfied, and in no case shall it be a defense to the remedy herein provided that a warrant for collection or execution has not been first returned
                    unsatisfied: Provided, however, that no salary or wage at the rate of less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month, whether paid weekly or monthly, shall be attached or garnished under the provisions of this section.

                        Cattle and Cattle Diseases. - The State Board of Agriculture has authority to make and enforce regulations for the quarantine of cattle and to prevent their transportation in view of preventing the spreading of contagious diseases. And an owner permitting
                        cattle to run at large in a no-fence county who willfully allows cattle to stray across the line is guilty of a violation of the act. State v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 630</cite>, 74 S.E. 458

                        publication of county or watershed data would result in disclosure of an individual operation's water use, the data will be combined with data from another county or watershed.

                    Every soil additive distributed in North Carolina shall be registered with the Commissioner by the person whose name appears on the label on forms furnished by the Commissioner. The applicant shall furnish such information as the Commissioner may require.
                    In determining the acceptability of any product for registration, the Commissioner may require proof of claims made for the soil additive. If no specific claims are made, the Commissioner may require proof of usefulness and value of
                    the soil additive. As evidence of proof, the Commissioner may rely on experimental data furnished by the applicant and may require that such data be developed by a recognized research or experimental institution. The Commissioner may
                    further require that such data be developed from tests conducted under conditions identical to or closely related to those present in North Carolina. The Commissioner may reject any data not developed under such conditions and may
                    rely on the advice of the Director of the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station in evaluating data for registration.

                    This Article shall be known by the title of "Structural Pest Control Act of North Carolina of 1955." It is declared to be the policy of this State that the regulation of persons, corporations and firms engaged in the business of structural pest control
                    in this State, as defined in G.S. 106-65.25, is in the public interest in order to ensure a high quality of workmanship and in order to prevent deception, fraud and unfair trade practices in the conduct of said business. The General
                    Assembly finds that quality of structural pest control work is not easily determined by the general public due to the inaccessibility of the areas treated and the complexity of the methods of treatment.

                    The Commissioner, subject to the provisions of section 13 of this act [Session Laws 1975, chapter 958, section 13] is authorized to designate by regulation one or more areas of this State as "elimination zones" where boll weevil eradication programs will
                    be undertaken. The Commissioner is authorized to promulgate reasonable regulations regarding areas where cotton cannot be planted within an elimination zone when he has reason to believe it will jeopardize the success of the program
                    or present a hazard to public health or safety. The Commissioner is authorized to issue regulations prohibiting the planting of noncommercial cotton in such elimination zones, and requiring that all growers of commercial cotton in
                    the elimination zones participate in a program of boll weevil eradication including cost sharing as prescribed in the regulations. Notice of such prohibition and requirement shall be given by publication for one day each week for three
                    successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the affected area. The Commissioner is authorized to set by regulation a reasonable schedule of penalty fees to be assessed when growers in designated "elimination zones"
                    do not meet the requirements of (G.S. 106-65.73) and participation in cost sharing as prescribed by regulation. Such penalty fees shall not exceed a charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per acre. When a grower fails to meet the requirements
                    of regulations promulgated by the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall have authority in elimination zones to destroy cotton not in compliance with such regulations.

                    pay for losses resulting from the destruction of cotton which was planted in such zones prior to promulgation of such notice.

                    The General Assembly of North Carolina finds that due to the interstate nature of boll weevil infestation, it is necessary to secure the cooperation of cotton growers, other State governments and agencies of the federal government, in order to carry out
                    a program of boll weevil suppression and eradication. The purpose of this Article is to provide for the certification of a cotton growers' organization to cooperate with State and federal agencies in the administration of cost-sharing
                    programs for the eradication and suppression of the boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis Boheman) and other cotton pests.

                <p>
                    Whenever in the judgment of the Board of Agriculture such action will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers, the Board shall promulgate regulations fixing and establishing for any food or class of food a reasonable definition and
                    standard of identity, and/or reasonable standard of quality and/or fill of container. In prescribing a definition and standard of identity for any food or class of food in which optional ingredients are permitted, the Board shall,
                    for the purpose of promoting honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers, designate the optional ingredients which shall be named on the label. The definitions and standards so promulgated shall conform so far as practicable
                    to the definitions and standards promulgated by the Commissioner of the Federal Food and Drug Administration under authority conferred by section 401 of the federal act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Temporary permits now or hereafter granted for interstate shipment of experimental packs of food varying from the requirements of federal definitions and standards of identity are automatically effective in this State under the conditions provided in
                    such permits. In addition, the Board of Agriculture may cause to be issued additional permits where they are necessary to the completion or conclusiveness of an otherwise adequate investigation and where the interests of consumers
                    are safeguarded. Such permits are subject to the terms and conditions the Board of Agriculture may prescribe by regulation.

                    The General Assembly finds that the recreational needs of the people, the interests of science, and the economy of the State require that threatened and endangered species of plants and species of plants of special concern be protected and conserved,
                    that their numbers should be enhanced and that propagative techniques be developed for them; however, nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit the rights of a property owner, without his consent, in the management of his

      </b> - Session Laws 2007-491, s. 47, provides: "G.S. 105-241.10, as enacted by Section 1 of this act, and Sections 6, 15, 16, 17, and 22 are effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2007. Section 14 is effective
                    for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. Sections 45, 46, and 47 are effective when they become law. The remainder of this act becomes effective January 1, 2008. The procedures for review of disputed tax matters enacted
                    by this act apply to assessments of tax that are not final as of the effective date of this act and to claims for refund pending on or filed on or after the effective date of this act. This act does not affect matters for which a petition
                    for review was filed with the Tax Review Board under G.S. 105-241.2 before the effective date of this act. The repeal of G.S. 105-122(c) and G.S. 105-130.4(t) and Sections 11 and 12 apply to requests for alternative apportionment formulas
                    filed on or after the effective date of this act. A petition filed with the Tax Review Board for an apportionment formula before the effective date of this act is considered a request under G.S. 105-122(c1) or G.S. 105-130.4(t1), as
                    appropriate."

                    processing, can be properly branded and will satisfy the milk sanitation rules adopted pursuant to G.S. 106-266.31, the court, after the payment of all costs, fees, and expenses and after the claimant posts an adequate bond, may order
                    that the milk be delivered to the claimant for proper labelling and processing under the supervision of the petitioner. The bond shall be returned to the claimant after the petitioner represents to the court either that the milk is

                    <p>
                        Protective Purpose of Article. - This Article has declared the policy of North Carolina to be one of protecting the farmer from the disastrous consequences of planting seed of one kind, believing he is planting another, and from the consequences of the
                        sale and delivery to farmers of seed falsely labeled. Gore v. George J. Ball, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 192</cite>, 182 S.E.2d 389 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Construction. - Although the North Carolina Seed Law of 1963 is regulatory in nature, it does not bar aggrieved parties from pursuing private, civil litigation for damages resulting from mislabeled seed; it is the public policy of North Carolina, as expressed
                        by the General Assembly in the Seed Law, to protect farmers from the disastrous consequences of planting seed of one kind, believing they are planting another. Kornegay Family Farms LLC v. Cross Creek Seed, Inc.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 23</cite>, 803 S.E.2d 377 (2017).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Article is not limited in its purpose or scope to the protection of the purchaser from fraud by the immediate vendor. Gore v. George J. Ball, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 192</cite>, 182 S.E.2d 389 (1971).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The North Carolina Seed Law is aimed at protecting farmers by strict labeling, quality control inspections and branding regulations. The seed law has no effect on a nonconflicting disclaimer which governs activity beyond its scope. Billings v. Joseph
                        Harris Co., <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 689, 220 S.E.2d 361 (1975), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 502</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 321 (1976).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Limitation of Remedies Clauses Violated Public Policy. - Because it was the policy of the State to protect farmers from the potentially devastating consequences of planting mislabeled seed, a corporation's limitation of remedies clauses were unenforceable
                        against commercial farmers; the farmers were sold mislabeled seed and could only recognize the mistake after planting the seeds, and enforcing the corporation's limitation of remedies clauses would foreclose the possibility of
                        them recovering consequential damages and would violate that policy. Kornegay Family Farms LLC v. Cross Creek Seed, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 23</cite>, 803 S.E.2d 377 (2017).

                        Indictment for Sale of Improperly Labeled Seed. - An indictment under this section charging the sale or offering for sale of seed not labeled in accordance with G.S. 106-277.3 should allege the person to whom defendant sold or offered to sell seed not
                        properly labeled, or that the purchaser was in fact unknown, the particulars in which the label failed to meet the statutory requirements, and where and how the seed was exposed to sale. State v. Bissette,

                        Construction. - Although the North Carolina Seed Law of 1963 is regulatory in nature, it does not bar aggrieved parties from pursuing private, civil litigation for damages resulting from mislabeled seed; it is the public policy of North Carolina, as expressed
                        by the General Assembly in the Seed Law, to protect farmers from the disastrous consequences of planting seed of one kind, believing they are planting another. Kornegay Family Farms LLC v. Cross Creek Seed, Inc.,

                        Limitation of Remedies Clauses Violated Public Policy. - Because the legislature is always presumed to act with full knowledge of prior and existing law, and it has taken no action over the last forty years to invalidate the supreme court's interpretation
                        of the policy of the North Carolina Seed Law of 1963 regarding limitation of remedies, that it invalidates enforcement of limitation of remedies clauses in private, civil actions based on mislabeled seed, the supreme court may
                        assume that the General Assembly is satisfied with that interpretation. Kornegay Family Farms LLC v. Cross Creek Seed, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 23</cite>, 803 S.E.2d 377 (2017).

                    under the federal Plant Variety Protection Act, the court shall order the payment of restitution to any injured party for any losses incurred as a result of the unlawful sale.

                    before a special seed board as an alternative to filing a court action. To take advantage of this procedure, a purchaser of seed must file a complaint with the North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture in time for the seed, crop,
                    or plants to be inspected. Failure to follow this procedure will limit the amount of damages you may be able to recover. Please contact the Commissioner of Agriculture for information about this claims procedure."

                    feedstuff, and not to protect from himself a farmer who mixes his own feed.

      </i> Crude protein ............. Three times the relative percentage * of deviation from the guarantee times the retail value of the commercial feed. Crude fat ................. Ten percent (10%) of retail value of the lot of
                    commercial feed. Crude fiber ............... Ten percent (10%) of retail value of the lot of commercial feed. Vitamins .................. Ten percent (10%) of retail value of the lot of commercial feed. Minerals ..................
                    Ten percent (10%) of retail value of the lot of commercial feed. Crude protein equiva- lent from nonprotein nitrogen .................. Ten percent (10%) of retail value of the lot of commercial feed. Animal drugs .............. Twenty
                    percent (20%) of retail value of the lot of commercial feed. Antibiotics ............... Twenty percent (20%) of retail value of the lot of commercial feed. Other analysis ............ Ten percent (10%) of retail value of the lot of

                    The State Veterinarian or an authorized representative may enter any property in the State or stop any motor vehicle to examine any poultry that the State Veterinarian has reason to believe is affected with or exposed to a contagious animal disease. The
                    State Veterinarian or an authorized representative may quarantine any poultry affected with or exposed to a contagious disease or injected with or otherwise exposed to any material capable of producing a contagious disease and give
                    public notice of the quarantine by posting or placarding with a suitable quarantine sign the entrance to or any part of the premises on which the poultry is held. The poultry shall be maintained by the poultry owner or the owner or
                    operator of the premises in accordance with this Part at the expense of the poultry owner or the owner or operator of the premises. The quarantine under this section does not apply to those diseases that are endemic in the State and
                    for which adequate preventive and control measures are not available. No poultry under quarantine shall be moved from the place of quarantine, unless permitted by the State Veterinarian or an authorized representative in writing. The
                    quarantine shall remain in effect until cancelled by official written notice from the State Veterinarian or an authorized representative and shall not be released or cancelled until the sick or dead poultry have been properly disposed
                    of and the premises have been properly cleaned and disinfected.

                    It is the duty of the owner of domesticated animals that die from any cause and the owner or operator of the premises upon which any domesticated animals die, to bury the animals to a depth of at least three feet beneath the surface of the ground within

                    animal closer than 300 feet to any flowing stream or public body of water. It is unlawful for any person to remove the carcasses of dead domesticated animals from the person's premises to the premises of any other person without the
                    written permission of the person having charge of the other premises and without burying the carcasses as provided under this section. The governing body of each municipality shall designate some appropriate person whose duty it shall
                    be to provide for the removal and disposal, according to the provisions of this section, of any dead domesticated animals located within the limits of the municipality when the owner of the animals cannot be determined. The board of
                    commissioners of each county shall designate some appropriate person whose duty it shall be to provide for the removal and disposal under this section, of any dead domesticated animals located within the limits of the county, but without
                    the limits of any municipality, when the owner of the animals cannot be determined. All costs incurred by a municipality or county in the removal of dead domesticated animals shall be recoverable from the owner of the animals upon
                    admission of ownership or conviction. "Domesticated animal" as used in this section includes poultry.

                    adjust both fees for market operation within the limits set in this section. A fee to be set by the Board of Agriculture may be charged to the buyer of cattle and swine required to be tested under G.S. 106-409 and 106-410, and the
                    amount collected used to offset the twenty-five dollar ($25.00) market operation fee. All test fees charged in excess of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall revert to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
                    and be payable within 24 hours following the close of a sale day. The starting and finishing time of each sale shall be recorded by the livestock inspector on his report of the sale. A copy of the report shall be given to the market
                    operator or his representative following the sale. Failure to make the required payment within 24 hours following close of a sale day shall be cause for the Commissioner of Agriculture to prohibit, on 72 hours' notice, further sales
                    at the market until the account is paid in full. The operation fee shall be waived when a livestock market operator employs a licensed, accredited veterinarian approved by the State Veterinarian to be present at the market from the
                    starting time of the sale until all livestock to be admitted to the sales barn on that sale day have entered and such work in inspection, testing and vaccination as designated by the State Veterinarian has been completed.

       § 106-465. Organization and membership of tobacco boards of trade; rules and regulations; fire insurance and extended coverage required; price fixing prohibited.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Tobacco warehousemen and the purchasers of leaf tobacco, at auction, on warehouse floors, are hereby authorized to organize, either as nonstock corporations, or voluntary associations, tobacco boards of trade in the several towns and cities in North Carolina
                    in which leaf tobacco is sold on warehouse floors, at auction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such tobacco boards of trade as may now exist, or which may hereafter be organized, are authorized to make reasonable rules and regulations for the economical and efficient handling of the sale of leaf tobacco at auction on the warehouse floors in the
                    several towns and cities in North Carolina in which an auction market is situated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each tobacco board of trade organized pursuant to this section shall, on or before June 1, 1973, by regulation, require that all auction warehouse firms which are members of, or may hereafter request membership in, such board of trade for the purpose
                    of displaying for sale and selling leaf tobacco, deposit with the board of trade prior to the market opening, a copy of a policy of fire insurance and extended coverage in a company licensed to do business in North Carolina to fully
                    insure, as determined by the board of trade, the market value of the maximum volume of tobacco that will be weighed and left displayed for sale on said warehouse floor at any time during the marketing season. Warehouses using mechanized
                    conveyor-line auction sales where tobacco is not displayed for sale on sales floor would be excluded from the requirement of this regulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In determining the market value and maximum volume of tobacco that will be weighed and placed on said warehouse floor at any one time, the board of trade shall use as criteria the prior season's official gross average price for that belt, as recorded
                    by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the maximum limit of daily sales, as recommended by the currently functioning flue-cured and burley tobacco marketing organizations, applied to each warehouse
                    based on the firm's pro rata share of the market's maximum limit daily sales opportunity, multiplied times the number of days of sales that said warehouse plans to place on sales floor at any one time, including any and all tobacco
                    weighed and deposited with the warehouse as bailee for future sale. The data relating to the official average price and the maximum limits of daily sales shall be assembled and supplied by the North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture
                    or his representative to the board of trade in each tobacco market in North Carolina, at least 30 days prior to the opening of markets in each belt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to operate an auction sale in said market until said policy is so deposited with and approved by the board of trade. The board of trade shall enjoin the sale of tobacco by any warehouse firm that
                    fails to so deposit a policy of fire insurance and extended coverage with the board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tobacco boards of trade in the several towns and cities in North Carolina are authorized to require as a condition to membership therein the applicants to pay a reasonable membership fee and the following schedule of maximum fees shall be deemed reasonable,
                    to wit:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A membership fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) in those towns in which less than 3,000,000 pounds of tobacco was sold at auction between the dates of August 20, 1931, and May 1, 1932; a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) in those towns in which during said
                    period of time more than 3,000,000 and less than 10,000,000 pounds of tobacco was sold; a fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) in those towns in which during said period of time more than 10,000,000 and less than 25,000,000 pounds
                    of tobacco was sold; a fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00) in those towns in which during said period of time more than 25,000,000 pounds of tobacco was sold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Membership, in good standing, in a local board of trade shall be deemed a reasonable requirement by such board of trade as a condition to participating in the business of operating a tobacco warehouse or the purchase of tobacco at auction therein.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Membership in the several boards of trade may be divided into two categories:

                <p>
                    Purchasers of leaf tobacco may be: (i) participating or (ii) nonparticipating. The holder of a membership as a purchaser of leaf tobacco shall have the option of becoming, upon written notice to the board of trade, either a participating or a nonparticipating
                    member. Individuals, partnerships, and/or corporations who are members of tobacco boards of trade, established under this section or coming within the provisions of this section, as nonparticipating members shall not participate in
                    or have any voice or vote in the management, conduct, activities, allotment of sales time, and/or hours, the fixing of dates for the opening or closing of tobacco auction markets, or in any other manner or respect. Individuals, partnerships,
                    and/or corporations who are such nonparticipating members in any of the several tobacco boards of trade shall not be responsible or liable for any of the acts, omissions or commissions of the several tobacco boards of trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It shall be unlawful and punishable as of a Class 1 misdemeanor for any bidder or purchaser of tobacco upon warehouse floors to refuse to take and pay for any basket or baskets so bid off from the seller when the seller has or has not accepted the price
                    offered by the purchaser or bidder of other baskets. Any person suspended or expelled from a tobacco board of trade under the provisions of this section may appeal from such suspension to the superior court of the county in which said
                    board of trade is located.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nothing in this section shall authorize the organization of any association having for its purpose the control of prices or the making of rules and regulations in restraint of trade.

        Interests of Warehousemen, Buyers and Sellers of Tobacco.
       </b> - The warehousemen have an economic stake in the markets' operations, but the markets exist for the purpose of serving the interests of buyers and sellers of tobacco. Those interests deserve inquiry and consideration

        Jurisdiction of Federal Trade Commission.
       </b> - There is a substantial public interest in maintaining free and open competition among warehousemen on tobacco auction markets. The public interest often is specific and substantial, because the unfair method employed
                        threatens the existence of present or potential competition. That is the basis for the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission in a case involving regulations adopted pursuant to this section governing the allocation of selling
                        time to tobacco warehouses. Asheville Tobacco Bd. of Trade, Inc. v. FTC, 263 F.2d 502 (4th Cir. 1959).

                    <p>
                        The decisions of the North Carolina courts since the enactment of this section make it clear that the sale of tobacco at auction is of great public importance to the State of North Carolina, but they also show that the operation of the business is in
                        the hands of private parties. A tobacco board of trade is organized primarily for the benefit of those engaged in the business; its articles of association and bylaws constitute a contract amongst the members by which each member
                        consents to reasonable regulations pertaining to the conduct of the business. Such a board is not an instrumentality of the State, and its activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission. Asheville Tobacco

                        Regulations adopted by a local tobacco board of trade involving allocation of selling time to warehouses were held in the instant case to unreasonably and unduly restrain trade in the purchase and sale of tobacco and to constitute unfair methods of competition

                        A tobacco board of trade has no authority to legislate. It cannot create a duty where the law creates none. The legislature has the authority to regulate, within constitutional limits, the sale of leaf tobacco upon the auction markets of this State, and
                        in doing so may prescribe standards of conduct to be observed by those who conduct auction warehouses as well as others participating in the sales. But this is a nondelegable power. Kinston Tobacco Bd. of Trade v. Liggett &amp;

                <p>
                    Meat and meat food products are an important source of the nation's total supply of food. It is essential in the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products distributed to them are
                    wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat or meat food products are injurious to the public welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly
                    labeled and packaged meat and meat food products, and results in sundry losses to livestock producers and processors of meat and meat food products, as well as injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively
                    packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally. It is hereby found that regulation
                    by the Board and cooperation by North Carolina and the United States as contemplated by this and the subsequent Article are appropriate to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise effectuate the purposes of this and
                    the subsequent Article.

                    by the area supervisor of the Meat and Poultry Inspection Service. All official marks may be required by such inspector to be removed from such article or animal before it is released unless it appears to the satisfaction of the area
                    supervisor that the article or animal is eligible to retain such marks.

                        Poultry and poultry products are an important source of the nation's total supply of food. It is essential in the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that slaughtered poultry and poultry products distributed
                        to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded poultry or poultry products are injurious to the public welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated,
                        and properly labeled and packaged poultry and poultry products, and result in sundry losses to poultry producers and processors of poultry and poultry products, as well as injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled,
                        or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally. It is hereby
                        found that regulation by the Board and cooperation by this State and the United States as contemplated by this Article are appropriate to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise effectuate the purposes of this

                    The passage by the Seventy-Ninth Congress of a law designated as Public Law 733, and more particularly Title II of that act, cited as "Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946," makes it all the more important for producers, handlers, processors and others
                    of specific agricultural commodities to associate themselves in action programs, separately and with public and private agencies, to obtain the greatest and most immediate benefits under the provisions of such law, in respect to research,
                    studies and problems of marketing, transportation and distribution.

                    purchaser, or his agent or representative, from the purchase price of any such agricultural products. The assessment so deducted, shall, on or before the first day of June of each year following such deduction or at regular intervals
                    during the year following such deductions, be remitted by such purchaser to the Commissioner of Agriculture of North Carolina who shall thereupon pay the amount of the assessments to the duly certified agency of the producers entitled
                    thereto. The books and records of all such purchasers of agricultural products shall at all times during regular business hours be open for inspection by the Commissioner of Agriculture or his duly authorized agents.

                <p>
                    For the purposes of this Article the Commissioner may designate the duly certified agency of the producers as his agent to conduct inspections or audits of the books of the purchaser of such agricultural products. If it is discovered, as the result of
                    such inspection or audit, that such purchaser has willfully failed to remit assessments when due, then such purchaser shall be liable to the duly certified producers agency for the reasonable costs of such inspection or audit. Such
                    costs may be recovered by the agency by an action against the purchaser in a court of competent jurisdiction. The agency shall also be entitled to recover from such purchaser a penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount due for each

Upon failure of said packer, processor or other purchaser to collect and remit said assessment then the amount of the assessment shall
                    become the obligation of the packer, processor or other purchaser who originally purchased the apples from the grower and he shall become liable therefor to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Failure

                    whom such assessments shall have been levied and collected under the provisions of this Article, if dissatisfied with said assessment and the result thereof, shall have the right to demand of and receive from the treasurer of said
                    agency a refund of such assessment so collected from such farmer or producer, provided such demand for refund is made in writing within 30 days from the date on which said assessment is collected or due to be collected, whichever is
                    earlier from such farmer or producer under the rules and regulations of the duly certified commission, council, board or other agency. Provided, however, that as to growers or producers of potatoes, apples or peaches the right of refund
                    of assessments as provided herein shall be contingent upon such growers or producers having paid said assessment on or before the end of the assessment year in which the assessment was levied. The assessment year shall be determined
                    by the duly certified commission, council, board or agency representing the respective commodity: Provided further, that any farmer or producer of potatoes, apples or peaches who fails to make any protest against the assessment and
                    levy in writing, addressed to the duly certified commission, council, board or agency representing the commodity concerned, within 30 days from the date such assessment shall become due and payable, then, and in such event, suit may
                    be brought by the duly certified commission, council, board or agency concerned in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the collection of the assessment. Provided further that on and after July 1, 1972, as to growers or producers
                    of apples there shall be no right of refund of assessments levied pursuant to the referendum provided for by Article 50, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.106.html" target="_blank">Chapter 106</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes of North Carolina.

                    The General Assembly finds and declares that it is in the best interest of the citizens of North Carolina to promote and encourage the development of an industrial hemp industry in the State in order to expand employment, promote economic activity, and
                    provide opportunities to small farmers for an environmentally sustainable and profitable use of crop lands that might otherwise be lost to agricultural production. The purposes of this Article are to establish an agricultural pilot
                    program for the cultivation of industrial hemp in the State, to provide for reporting on the program by growers and processors for agricultural or other research, and to pursue any federal permits or waivers necessary to allow industrial
                    hemp to be grown in the State.

                    It is desirable that there should be uniformity between the requirements of the several states. Therefore, the Board and Commission are directed, consistent with the purposes of this Article, to so enforce this Article as to strive for achievement of
                    such uniformity and are also authorized and empowered to cooperate with and enter into agreements with any other agency of this State, or any other state regulating antifreeze, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this
                    Article and securing uniformity of regulations in conformity to the primary standards established by this Article.

                    On or before the first day of July of each year, and before any antifreeze may be distributed for the permit year beginning July 1, the manufacturer, packager, or person whose name appears on the label shall make application to the Commissioner on forms
                    provided by the latter for registration for each brand of antifreeze which he desires to distribute. The application shall be accompanied by specimens or facsimiles of labeling for all container sizes to be distributed, when requested
                    by the Commissioner; a license and inspection fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each brand of antifreeze and a properly labeled sample of the antifreeze shall also be submitted at this time. The Commissioner may inspect, test,
                    or analyze the antifreeze and review the labeling. If the antifreeze is not adulterated or misbranded, if it meets the standards established and promulgated by the Board, and if the said antifreeze is not such a type or kind that is
                    in violation of this Article, the Commissioner shall thereafter issue a written license or permit authorizing the sale of such antifreeze in this State for the fiscal year in which the license or inspection fee is paid. If the antifreeze
                    is adulterated or misbranded, if it fails to meet standards promulgated by the Board, or is in violation of this Article or regulations thereunder, the Commissioner shall refuse to register the antifreeze, and he shall return the application
                    to the applicant, stating how the antifreeze or labeling is not in conformity. If the Commissioner shall, at a later date, find that a properly registered antifreeze product has been materially altered or adulterated, or a change has
                    been made in the name, brand or trademark under which the antifreeze is sold, or that it violates the provisions of this Article, or that it violates regulations, definitions or standards duly promulgated by the Board, he shall notify
                    the applicant that the license authorizing sale of the antifreeze is canceled. No antifreeze license shall be canceled unless the registrant shall have been given an opportunity to be heard before the Commissioner or his duly designated
                    agent and to modify his application in order to comply with the requirements of this Article and regulations, definitions, and standards promulgated by the Board. All fees received by the Commissioner shall be placed in the Department

                <p>
                    It is the declared policy of the State to conserve and protect and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural land and forestland for the production of food, fiber, and other products. When other land uses extend into agricultural and
                    forest areas, agricultural and forestry operations often become the subject of nuisance suits. As a result, agricultural and forestry operations are sometimes forced to cease. Many others are discouraged from making investments in
                    farm and forest improvements. It is the purpose of this Article to reduce the loss to the State of its agricultural and forestry resources by limiting the circumstances under which an agricultural or forestry operation may be deemed
                    to be a nuisance.

                        Findings and Purpose. - The General Assembly finds that sentinel landscapes are places where preserving the working and rural character of the State's private lands is important for both national defense and conservation priorities. It is the intent of
                        the General Assembly to direct the Committee to coordinate the overlapping priority areas in the vicinity of and where testing and training occur near or adjacent to major military installations, as that term is defined in G.S.
                        143-215.115, or other areas of strategic benefit to national defense. Further, the Committee shall assist landowners in improving their land to benefit their operations and enhance wildlife habitats while furthering the State's
                        vested economic interest in preserving, maintaining, and sustaining land uses that are compatible with military activities at major military installations and National Guard facilities. In its work, the Committee shall develop
                        and implement programs and strategies that (i) protect working lands in the vicinity of and where testing and training occur near or adjacent to major military installations or other areas of strategic benefit to national defense,
                        (ii) address restrictions that inhibit military testing and training, and (iii) forestall incompatible development in the vicinity of and where testing and training occur near or adjacent to military installations or other areas
                        of strategic benefit to national defense.

                    provide funds for strawberry research and marketing.

                    the use and enjoyment of adjoining property.

                        The General Assembly finds that North Carolina has suffered a significant loss of its traditional industrial and agricultural economic base. The State's dairy industry is at serious risk of total collapse unless milk prices reach levels sufficient to
                        allow dairy farmers to meet production costs. At the same time, North Carolina is experiencing rapid population growth and urbanization. This growth and urbanization have fueled a rapid loss of prime agricultural land and green
                        space, resulting in a decline in the quality of life for which the State is known.

                        The General Assembly finds that the dairy industry in North Carolina makes a substantial economic, environmental, and quality-of-life contribution to the well-being of the citizens of the State. The dairy industry, including both producers and processors,
                        currently contributes over six hundred million dollars ($600,000,000) and 3,000 jobs to the State's economy. Properly managed dairy farms help maintain green space, keep prime agricultural land under production, maintain water
                        quality, enhance food security, and provide a local supply of fresh milk at a reasonable cost to the consumer and to processors in the State. An adequate local milk supply has become increasingly important as transportation costs
                        escalate, making the importation of milk from out-of-state increasingly expensive. The General Assembly finds, however, that despite its importance to the State's economic and environmental well-being, North Carolina's dairy industry
                        is under severe economic pressure, and milk production is declining at an alarming rate. According to United States Department of Agriculture statistics, since 1985 the State has lost sixty-seven percent (67%) of its dairy farms
                        and thirty-five percent (35%) of its processing facilities. North Carolina dairy farms no longer produce sufficient milk for North Carolina's processing facilities to operate. Milk must be imported 10 out of 12 months each year
                        to keep these processing facilities functioning. Further, farm prices for milk exhibit great volatility, creating financial risk and discouraging investment. The General Assembly finds that it is essential to a viable North Carolina
                        dairy industry to have locally produced milk available to processors in the State. The General Assembly further finds that it is essential to the well-being of the citizens of the State to have a local supply of fresh milk available
                        at reasonable cost and not subject to the vagaries of transportation costs and production conditions in other regions of the country.

                        The General Assembly finds that one of the primary reasons for the decline in milk production in the State is the gap between the price paid to farmers for milk under the federal milk programs and the actual cost of production. Inability to meet production
                        costs combined with increasing land prices have led many milk producers to sell their farms for development and retire or turn to other employment. The General Assembly finds that the most effective means to ensure the continuation
                        of a viable dairy industry in this State is to establish a price floor for milk to enable dairy farmers to meet their production costs. It is the intent of the General Assembly to establish a price support program that will stabilize
                        and reverse the decline in the local milk supply and in the dairy industry in the State and encourage new producers to enter the dairy industry. Sustaining and growing North Carolina's dairy industry will advance the State's goals
                        of preserving and enhancing its economic base and improving the quality of life in the State through maintaining green space and water quality and assuring an adequate local supply of fresh milk.

                    the Commissioner; and shall perform such other acts and duties as shall be considered necessary by the Commissioner in the protection, development and improvement of the forested area of each of the counties within the State. No county
                    may be held liable for any part of the expenses thus incurred unless specifically authorized by the board of county commissioners under prior written agreement with the Commissioner; appropriations for meeting the county's share of

                    made by a county for the purposes set out in Articles 75, 76, 78, and 82 of this Chapter in the cooperative forest protection, development and improvement work are not to replace State and federal funds which may be available to the

                    in a county unless that county shall contribute at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total cost of the forestry program.

                    shall take the oath of office prescribed by Section 7 of Article VI of the North Carolina Constitution. Of these officers, the Commissioner may designate certain officers to also have the powers and the duties of a forest ranger enumerated

                    probable cause for believing has committed a crime in the officer's presence and bring such person or persons forthwith before a district court or other officer having jurisdiction. Department law enforcement officers shall also have
                    authority to obtain and serve warrants including warrants for violation of any duly promulgated rule of the Department.

                <p>
                    The purpose of this Article is to regulate certain open burning in order to protect the public from the hazards of forest fires and air pollution and to adapt such regulation to the needs and circumstances of the different areas of North Carolina. The
                    General Assembly finds that open burning in proximity to woodlands must be regulated in all counties to protect against forest fires and air pollution. The General Assembly further finds that in certain counties a high percentage of
                    the land area contains organic soils or forest types which may pose greater problems of forest fire and air pollution controls, and that in counties in which a great amount of land-clearing operations is taking place on these organic
                    soils or these forest types, additional control of open burning is required. The counties subject to the need for additional control are classified as high hazard counties for purpose of this Article.

       § 106-965. Legislative findings.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The General Assembly finds that prescribed burning of forestlands is a management tool that is beneficial to North Carolina's public safety, forest and wildlife resources, environment, and economy. The General Assembly finds that the following are benefits
                    that result from prescribed burning of forestlands:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li id="t106a80s106-965ol11">
                        Prescribed burning reduces the naturally occurring buildup of vegetative fuels on forestlands, thereby reducing the risk and severity of wildfires and lessening the loss of life and property.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t106a80s106-965ol12">
                        The State's ever-increasing population is resulting in urban development directly adjacent to fire-prone forestlands, referred to as a woodland-urban interface area. The use of prescribed burning in these woodland-urban interface areas substantially reduces
                        the risk of wildfires that cause damage.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t106a80s106-965ol13">
                        Many of North Carolina's natural ecosystems require periodic fire for their survival. Prescribed burning is essential to the perpetuation, restoration, and management of many plant and animal communities. Prescribed burning benefits game, nongame, and
                        endangered wildlife species by increasing the growth and yield of plants that provide forage and an area for escape and brooding and that satisfy other habitat needs.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t106a80s106-965ol14">
                        Forestlands are economic, biological, and aesthetic  resources of statewide significance. In addition to   reducing the frequency and severity of wildfires,  prescribed burning of forestlands helps to prepare sites for replanting and natural seeding,
                        to control insects and diseases, and to increase productivity.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t106a80s106-965ol15">
                        Prescribed burning enhances the resources on public use lands, such as State and national forests, wildlife refuges, nature preserves, and game lands. Prescribed burning enhances private lands that are managed for wildlife refuges, nature preserves, and
                        game lands. Prescribed burning enhances private lands that are managed for wildlife, recreation, and other purposes.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    As North Carolina's population grows, pressures resulting from liability issues and smoke complaints discourage or limit prescribed burning so that these numerous benefits to forestlands often are not attainable. By recognizing the benefits of prescribed
                    burning and by adopting requirements governing prescribed burning, the General Assembly helps to educate the public, avoid misunderstandings, and reduce complaints about this valuable management tool.
