                        Purpose of Section. - This section was passed to protect landlords who made verbal or written leases and omitted in their contracts to make provision for reentry on nonpayment of rent when due. The consequence was that often an insolvent lessee would
                        avoid payment of rent, refuse to vacate and stay on until his term expired. Ryan v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 563</cite>, 130 S.E. 156 (1925).

                        This section and G.S. 42-33 are remedial in nature and will apply only where the parties' lease does not cover the issue of forfeiture of the lease term upon nonpayment of rent. Where the contracting parties have considered the issue, negotiated a response,
                        and memorialized their response within the lease, the trial court appropriately should decline to apply these statutory provisions. Charlotte Office Tower Assocs. v.

                        Provision Written into Lease. - This section writes into a contract of a lease of lands, when the lease is silent thereon, a forfeiture of the terms of the lease upon failure of the lessee to pay the rent within 10 days after a demand is made by the lessor
                        or his agent for all past due rent, with right of the lessor to enter and dispossess the lessee. Ryan v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 563</cite>, 130 S.E. 156 (1925).

                        Forfeiture Is for Benefit of Lessor. - The forfeiture implied by this section is for the benefit of the lessor, and is to be declared only at his application. Monger v. Lutterloh, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 274</cite>, 142

                        Ten Days After Demand. - Where a lease contained no forfeiture clause for failure to pay rent, and lessee, after lessor's death, paid rent to lessor's personal representative, to the knowledge of lessor's heir, the heir, who made no demand for the rent,
                        could not declare the lease forfeited, since in the absence of a forfeiture clause, this section applied, and forfeiture under it was not effective until the expiration of 10 days after demand. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co.

                        Where the lease contains no forfeiture clause for failure to pay rent, lessors may assert forfeiture for nonpayment of rent only after 10 days from demand upon lessees for payment. Reynolds v. Earley, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 521</cite>,

                        What Constitutes "Demand". - To constitute a "demand" under this section, a clear, unequivocal statement, either oral or written, requiring the lessee to pay all past due rent, is necessary.

                        Demand must be made with sufficient authority to place the lessee on notice that the lessor intends to exercise his or her statutory right to forfeiture for nonpayment of rent.

                    <p>
                        Forfeiture Denied upon Tender of Rent and Costs. - Where, during the hearing and before judgment on a petition for forfeiture of a lease under this section, all rents and costs lawfully incurred were tendered to the petitioner, the petition was properly
                        denied. Coleman v. Carolina Theatres, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 607</cite>, 143 S.E. 7 (1928).

                        Eviction of Tenants at Will Not Dependent upon Failure to Pay Rent. - Where a tenancy at will exists, a landlord's right to evict the tenants does not depend on whether the tenants have failed to pay their rent. Stout v. Crutchfield,

                        Upon Eviction, Tenancy at Will Instantly Expires. - When a landlord tells tenants to vacate the premises, their tenancy at will instantly expires, regardless of whether they have defaulted on the rent. Stout v. Crutchfield,
                        <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 204 S.E.2d 541, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 595</cite>, 205 S.E.2d 726 (1974).

                        Tenants have the right to bring an immediate action for summary ejectment under G.S. 42-26(1). Stout v. Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 204 S.E.2d 541, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 595</cite>,

                        Lessor Must Terminate Lessee's Estate Before Commencing Summary Ejectment Action. - The trial court erred in granting lessor summary ejectment of lessee since lessor's letter to lessee did not amount to notice that lease was terminated and lessor must
                        terminate lessee's estate before commencing on summary ejectment action. Stanley v. Harvey, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 535, 369 S.E.2d 382 (1988).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lessor was entitled to summary ejectment because the lessor had a right to dispossess the lessee and the sublessee under G.S. 42-3 as the lessee, when the sublessee quit paying rent to the lessee, failed to pay the past-due rent within 10 days of the
                        date the lessor demanded payment of all past-due rent, and forfeiture of the commercial lease was then implied. Gardner v. Ebenezer, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 660 S.E.2d 172 (2008).

                        Failure to Pay Taxes Not Equivalent of Failure to Pay Rent - Alleged failure of tenant to pay property taxes on real property the tenant occupied under a lease with an option to purchase was not the equivalent of breach of a covenant to pay rent, and
                        the landlord was not justified in attempting to declare the lease void and force the tenant to sign a new lease at a higher rent without the option to purchase; as lease was still in effect, tenant had the right to exercise the
                        option to purchase the property. Creech v. Ranmar Props., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite> 97, 551 S.E.2d 224 (2001), cert. denied and dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 160</cite>, 568

                    When any person occupies land of another by the permission of such other, without any express agreement for rent, or upon a parol lease which is void, the landlord may recover a reasonable compensation for such occupation, and if by such parol lease a

                        Judge Did Not Have Authority to Assign No Rental Value at All. - In an action under this section, while the trial judge had the authority to believe all, any or none of the landowner's testimony, and so to decline to accept her estimate of reasonable
                        compensation, he did not have the authority to refuse to assign any rental value to the land at all. Even if the house on the property was fallen down or demolished, the land would still have had a rental value. Simon v. Mock,

                    If a lease of land, in which rent is reserved, payable at the end of the year or other certain period of time, is determined by the death of any person during one of the periods in which the rent was growing due, the lessor or his personal representative
                    may recover a part of the rent which becomes due after the death, proportionate to the part of the period elapsed before the death, subject to all just allowances; and if any security was given for such rent it shall be apportioned
                    in like manner.

                    to the hiring, the lessee may surrender his estate in the demised premises by a writing to that effect delivered or tendered to the landlord within 10 days from the damage or destruction, and by paying or tendering at the same time

                        Repairs by Lessor Within Reasonable Time. - Where the controversy was made to depend upon whether the damage to the leased premises had been repaired by the lessor within a reasonable time when the extent of the damage was insufficient to terminate the
                        lease under its written terms, evidence that three days had elapsed between the time the lessor and lessee had agreed upon the necessary repairs and the time the repairs were made was sufficient to sustain an affirmative verdict
                        that they were made in a reasonable time. Archibald v. Swaringen, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 756</cite>, 135 S.E. 849 (1926).

                        Where a swimming pool was leased for a year, under a written contract that the lease would terminate upon the pool becoming unfit for use, it was held that a crack in the walls thereof by which the pool was drained of water, which was repaired by the
                        lessor at an inappreciable sum, was not sufficient to give the lessee the right to cancel the lease when the repair was made under a parol agreement within a reasonable time. Archibald v. Swaringen,

                        Time Allowed Lessee for Repairs. - Where a monthly rental to be paid by the lessee of a building, and an obligation to make certain repairs by him, are specified as the consideration for the lease, with forfeiture of the lease upon the nonpayment of the
                        rent at stated times, the lessee's liability to repair and to pay rent are, as a rule, distinct and independent obligations, and the law will imply that the lessee be given a reasonable time in which to make the repairs if no time
                        is stated in the lease. Miles v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 479</cite>, 102 S.E. 884 (1920).

                        Applicability of Lease to Building Restored by Landlord. - Though the landlord may be under no implied obligation to restore or repair a building which has been destroyed, etc., if he does enter and make the required repairs without further agreement
                        on the subject, the building so rebuilt or restored will come under the provisions of the lease as far as the same may be applied, and for a breach the landlord may be held responsible. Miles v. Walker,

                    <p>
                        A tenant from year to year is entitled to a written or verbal notice to quit, and a mere demand for possession is insufficient. Vincent v. Corbin, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 108</cite> (1881).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A landlord has no right to dispossess his tenant from year to year, without first giving the statutory notice, where the tenant acknowledges the tenancy, sets up no adverse claim or other defense, and relies upon the want of legal notice. Fayetteville
                        Waterworks Co. v. Tillinghast, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 343</cite>, 25 S.E. 960 (1896).

                    <p>
                        Verbal Notice Is Sufficient. - A verbal notice by landlord to tenant is sufficient. Poindexter v. Call, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 366</cite>, 109 S.E. 26 (1921).

                    <p>
                        Effect of Failure to Provide Notice. - Generally, the effect of failure to provide notice when it is required under this section is that the parties are bound to a new term. The rule applies to agricultural tenancies, even those for fixed one-year terms
                        under G.S. 42-23. Lewis v. Lewis Nursery, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 342 S.E.2d 45, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 43 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Insufficient Notice. - In an action in summary ejectment under G.S. 42-26, proof of notice given the 14th of the month to quit the premises on or before the first of the following month was insufficient to show the statutory notice terminating the term,
                        when it appeared that the original occupancy was taken on the 18th of the month and plaintiff offered no evidence as to the date of the month the term began or when the monthly rentals became due. Stafford v. Yale,
                        <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 220</cite>, 44 S.E.2d 872 (1947).

                        Where on May 18, 1897, a landlord gave a tenant from month to month notice "to get out within 30 days," and the landlord had received the rent for May, it was held that such notice was invalid as to May, as the rent had been paid, and as to June, because
                        not ending with the month. Simmons v. Jarman, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 195</cite>, 29 S.E. 332 (1898).

                        Tenant at Will Not Entitled to Notice. - Where a person is put in possession of land by the owner, without any agreement for rent, and with an express provision that he shall leave it whenever the owner may require him to do so, he is not a tenant from
                        year to year, but is strictly a tenant at will, and is not entitled to notice to quit as provided in this section. Humphries v. Humphries, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. 362</cite> (1843).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Election of Lessor When Tenant Holds Over. - In the absence of a provision in the lease for an extension of the term, when a tenant under a lease for a fixed term of one year or more holds over after the end of the term the lessor may eject him or recognize
                        him as a tenant. Kearney v. Hare, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 570</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 636 (1965).

                        Nothing else appearing, when a tenant for a fixed term of one year or more holds over after the expiration of such term, the lessor has an election. He may treat him as a trespasser and bring an action to evict him and to recover reasonable compensation
                        for the use of the property, or he may recognize him as still a tenant, having the same rights and duties as under the original lease, except that the tenancy is one from year to year and is terminable by either party upon giving
                        to the other 30 days' notice directed to the end of any year of such new tenancy. Coulter v. Capitol Fin. Co., <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 214</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 97 (1966).

                    <p>
                        Term and Rights of Tenant Who Holds Over and Is Recognized. - The fact that a tenant who entered into the occupation of premises under an express lease from month to month continued the occupation for more than two years did not entitle him to one month's
                        notice to quit. Jones v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. 430</cite> (1862).

                    <p>
                        It was not error to charge the jury that if tenant leased premises at $5.00 per month and had held over several months, paying the same rent without any new agreement, he was a tenant from month to month, and entitled to 14 days' (now seven days') notice
                        to quit. Branton v. O'Briant, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 99</cite> (1885).

                    <p>
                        When a tenant for a year or longer time holds over and is recognized by the landlord without further agreement or other qualifying facts or circumstances, he becomes a tenant from year to year, and is subject to the payment of the rent and other stipulations
                        of the lease as far as the same may be applied to existing conditions. Stedman v. McIntosh, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. 291</cite> (1844); Scheelky v. Koch, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 80</cite>, 25
                        S.E. 713 (1896); Harty v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 408</cite>, 27 S.E. 90 (1897); Holton v. Andrews, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 340</cite>, 66 S.E. 212 (1909); Murrill v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 50</cite>,
                        80 S.E. 55 (1913).

                    <p>
                        If the lessor elects to treat as a tenant one holding over after the end of the term of a lease for one year or more, a new tenancy relationship is created as of the end of the former term. This is, by presumption of law, a tenancy from year to year,
                        the terms of which are the same as those of the former lease insofar as they are applicable, in the absence of a new contract between them or of other circumstances rebutting such presumption. Such a tenancy may be terminated by
                        either party at the end of any year thereof by giving notice of intent so to terminate 30 days before the end of such year. Kearney v. Hare, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 570</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 636 (1965).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Special Agreement When Tenant Holds Over. - It is competent to rebut the presumption that a tenant who holds over is a tenant from year to year by proof of a special agreement. Harty v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 408</cite>,
                        27 S.E. 90 (1897).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where a tenancy is from year to year, and, after the commencement of a year, there is an express lease for a certain time and an agreement to quit at the end of that time, no notice is necessary in order to terminate the tenancy after such time. Williams
                        v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. 122</cite> (1843).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where a lease for an original term of 36 months provided that "should the lessee remain in possession of the leased premises beyond the expiration of the original term or any renewal or extension of this lease, which shall result in a tenancy from month
                        to month, this lease may be terminated by either party upon the giving of thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party," the purpose of the clause was held to have been to provide that in such circumstances the tenancy would
                        be from month to month, and so terminable by either party at the end of any month, but only upon 30 days' notice rather than upon the seven days' notice which would otherwise be sufficient to terminate a month to month tenancy
                        under this section. Coulter v. Capitol Fin. Co., <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 214</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 97 (1966).

                        Effect of Leaving Premises After Waiver of Notice. - A tenant from year to year who waives his right to notice to quit and goes out of possession has no right to go back on the premises. Torrans v. Stricklin, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 50</cite>                        (1859).

                        Where one occupied land as his own and refused to quit when possession was demanded, it was held that he could not afterwards insist upon the statutory notice. Head v. Head, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 620</cite> (1860).

                        Termination of Lease Valid. - Trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of a lessor in its summary ejectment action under G.S. 42-26(a) because the lessee's affidavits failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the validity
                        of the lessor's termination of the lease since there was no genuine issue of material fact that the lessor's president was acting in at least a de facto capacity as president when she terminated the lease or that the lessor, as
                        a corporation, had an officer with the title of president; in her affidavit, the president averred that she was validly elected by the lessor's members and was acting in that capacity when she terminated the lease. Havelock Yacht

                        cooperate with and allow the State Bar to take possession of the potentially confidential materials, and the landlord shall not be liable in any way to the tenant for his or her cooperation. However, if the tenant elects to take

                            The lien under this section is acquired automatically by virtue of the landlord's status, and no writing or recordation is required in order to establish the lien. Rivenbark v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite>                            339, 291 S.E.2d 293 (1982).

                            This section makes a judgment for rent a lien on the crop. Hargrove v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 418</cite>, 21 S.E. 916 (1895).
                            <br />

                            Lien Hereunder Is Exclusive. - The only statutory landlord's lien in this jurisdiction is that provided for by this section. Dunham's Music House, Inc. v. Asheville Theatres, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            242, 178 S.E.2d 124 (1970).

                        <p>
                            No Right of Distress. - A landlord's right of distress as a security for the payment of rent available under English common law has never existed in North Carolina. Dunham's Music House, Inc. v. Asheville Theatres, Inc.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 178 S.E.2d 124 (1970).

                            The common-law remedy of lessors by distress does not obtain in this State; and except as specifically given by statute, a landlord has no lien on the product of the leased property for rent. Howland v. Forlaw, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 567</cite>,
                            13 S.E. 173 (1891); Reynolds v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 165</cite>, 56 S.E. 871 (1907).

                            Lien Applies Only to Leases for Agricultural Purposes. - This statutory lien is only given when lands are rented or leased for agricultural purposes. Reynolds v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 165</cite>, 56 S.E. 871
                            (1907).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Except in the case of landlord and tenant provided for specifically by this section, the lessor has no lien upon the product of the leased property as rent; it is for all purposes, until division, deemed vested in the tenant, and his sale to a third person
                            before the rent is ascertained and set apart conveys a good title. Howland v. Forlaw, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 567</cite>, 13 S.E. 173 (1891).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            The words "crops raised" mean simply the crops grown or gathered during the year. The word "raised" appears nowhere else in the section, nor in succeeding section; only the word "crops" is used. The legislature had in mind no distinction between fructus
                            industriales (products obtained by labor and cultivation) and fructus naturales (products which emanate from the power of nature alone), and there was no need of any. State v. Crook, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 1053</cite>,
                            44 S.E. 32 (1903).

                        <p>
                            Hay is ordinarily embraced in the word "crop," as used in this section. But not, it seems, when it is merely a spontaneous growth, such as crabgrass, which springs up after another crop is housed. State v. Crook, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 1053</cite>,
                            44 S.E. 32 (1903).

                        <p>
                            What Constitutes One a Cropper. - An agreement by him who cultivates land that the owner who advances guano, seed wheat, etc., shall out of the crop be repaid in wheat for such advancements, constitutes the former a cropper, and not a tenant. State v.
                            Burwell, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 661</cite> (1869).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A cropper has no estate in the land, and his possession is that of the landlord. State v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 749</cite>, 31 S.E. 731 (1898).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Lien Covers All Crops of the Season. - This section gives the landlord a lien for his rent "on any and all crops," that is, on all that is "cropped, cut or gathered" in that season from his land. State v. Crook, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 1053</cite>,
                            44 S.E. 32 (1903).

                        <p>
                            Lien Does Not Cover Crops of Subsequent Years. - The operation of a mortgage or agricultural lien in respect to crops is confined to crops then or about to be planted, and will not be extended further than those planted next after the execution of the
                            instrument. Wooten v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 48</cite>, 3 S.E. 846 (1887).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The landlord's lien under this section does not attach to a crop made entirely in a year subsequent to that in which the advancements are furnished to the tenant. Brooks v. Garrett, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 452</cite>,
                            142 S.E. 486 (1928).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Antecedent Debts Not Included. - It was not intended to confer a lien upon the landlord for antecedent debts which the lessee might stipulate to pay, and give them a preference over the agricultural lienee, whose money and supplies materially assisted
                            in the production of the crops. This view is assumed to be correct in Thigpen v. Maget, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 39</cite>, 12 S.E. 272 (1890) and is undoubtedly in harmony with the policy
                            of the law in securing the landlord his rent, and at the same time enabling the tenant to obtain advances from third parties. Ballard v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 141</cite>, 19 S.E. 98 (1894).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No Priority for Antecedent Debts. - Although under this section and former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.044.html#t44a10s44-52" target="_blank">G.S. 44-52</a></cite> and G.S. 44-60 the lien of a landlord for
                            rent and advances is superior to that of a third party making advances to the tenant, yet such priority exists only for rent accruing or advances made during the year in which the crops are grown, and not for a balance due
                            for an antecedent year. Ballard v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 141</cite>, 19 S.E. 98 (1894).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lien Does Not Attach to Proceeds of Hail Insurance Policy. - Where a tenant procures and pays for a policy of hail storm insurance, nothing else appearing, the landlord's statutory crop lien for advancements under this section does not extend to the fund
                            paid by insurer under the policy after damage to the crop by the risk covered. Peoples v. United States Fire Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 303</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 381 (1958).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lien of Assignee. - The assignee of a note given by a tenant for rent has a landlord's lien on the crop. Avera v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. 50</cite> (1877).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The assignee of a landlord's lien for rent is the owner of the crops raised to the extent of cash rent due and is entitled thereto as against tenant and third-party holder of note for rent. Rhodes v. Smith-Douglass Fertilizer Co.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 21</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 408 (1941).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the occupant of land is a vendee or mortgagor in default, although he may for some purposes be considered a tenant at will, he is not a lessee whose crop, under the provisions of this section, is vested in the landlord. Taylor v. Taylor,
                            <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 27</cite>, 16 S.E. 924 (1893).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lien Conferred upon Mortgagee by Agreement. - An agreement after default, between mortgagor and mortgagee, that the mortgagor was to remain in possession as tenant, would confer a landlord's lien upon the mortgagee. Cooper v. Kimbell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 120</cite>, 31 S.E. 346 (1898).

                        <p>
                            Lien Conferred by Contract on Vendor After Default. - After default by a vendee of land to pay the purchase money, the vendor may by contract become landlord of the vendee so as to avail himself of the landlord's lien given by this section. Jones v. Jones,
                            <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 254</cite>, 23 S.E. 214 (1895); Ford v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 70</cite>, 28 S.E. 132 (1897).

                        <p>
                            Agreements Between Tenants in Common. - Where A and B, tenants in common, agreed to make partition of lands and fix the boundaries, and A agreed that B should occupy the whole and pay to him a portion of the crop raised thereon, it was held that although
                            this was valid as an agreement for a year, it did not constitute a lease, so as to create the relation of landlord and tenant between the parties. Medlin v. Steele, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 154</cite>                            (1876).

                        <p>
                            When Lessee Has Lien. - When a lessee sublets a part of the farm he becomes a lessor to his sublessee and is entitled to the same lien on his crop which the statute gives a lessor. Moore v. Faison, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 322</cite>,
                            2 S.E. 169 (1887). See also, Perry v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 23</cite>, 37 S.E. 71 (1900).

                        <p>
                            Effect of Subletting. - The landlord's right to the crop to secure payment of rent is not impaired by the subletting of his tenant. The subtenant's crop may thereby be subjected to a double lien, that of the landlord and that of his immediate lessor,
                            but the lien of the landlord is paramount. Montague v. Mial, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 137</cite> (1883); Moore v. Faison, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 322</cite>, 2 S.E. 169 (1887); State v.

                            This section gives a landlord the title to the crop until the rent is actually paid (whether the claim be reduced to a judgment or not), and such title is not impaired by the fact that the tenant conveys the crop to a third person, who takes without notice
                            of the landlord's claim. The rule caveat emptor applies. Belcher v. Grimsley, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. 88</cite> (1883).

                            The tenant, who owns the crop subject to the landlord's rights and lien, has the right to sell the crop, but in the same plight in which he holds it, that is, the purchaser from the tenant takes subject to the landlord's lien, and where the crop remains
                            on the land, the purchaser can remove the crop only by consent of the landlord until the rent is paid. Hall v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 66</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 129 (1954).

                            Third Party Charged with Notice. - Every person who makes advancements to a tenant or cropper of another does so with notice of the rights of the landlord, and with notice that any lien that he may have on the tenant's crop is preferred to all others,
                            and the risk is his if the tenant does not satisfy the preferred lien by complying with the contract and all stipulations in regard thereto. Thigpen v. Leigh, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 47</cite>                            (1885); Thigpen v. Maget, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 39</cite>, 12 S.E. 272 (1890). See also Eason v.

                        <p>
                            A purchaser or mortgagee of a crop takes with full knowledge that if advances shall be necessary to enable the cultivator to make the crop, and without which there would perhaps be no crop, such advances shall be a preferred lien upon the crop, made by
                            reason of such advances, and this preference shall extend to "existing" liens. Wooten v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 48</cite>, 3 S.E. 846 (1887).

                            The landlord's lien exists by virtue of this section. No written instrument is required or contemplated. The registration acts, which apply only to written instruments capable of registration, have no significance relative to a landlord's lien. This section
                            itself gives notice to all the world of the law relative to a landlord's lien. Hall v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 66</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 129 (1954).

                            The landlord's lien remains intact until the rent is paid, and all who deal with a tenant with reference to the crop are charged with notice thereof. Nothing short of an actual payment or a complete satisfaction of the lessor's demands meets the words
                            of this section or will serve to determine his lien or title. Neither can the fact that purchasers of the crop had no notice of the landlord's claim at all impair it, in the absence of any suggestion of fraud on his part. It
                            is a question of title, and the tenant can convey no better right to the property than he himself was possessed of. The principle of caveat emptor applies with full force to the case. Hall v. Odom,

                            was not available when it was shown that the landlord had consented to the sale and had thereafter taken possession of the crop at the tenant's request. Lee v. Melton, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 704</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Pleading and Proof of Waiver. - It is not to be understood that a landlord cannot by agreement, express or implied, waive his lien, or by his acts and conduct be estopped from asserting his lien. The gist of such affirmative defense is allegation and
                            proof of such facts and circumstances as will establish the proposition that the landlord in effect constituted the tenant his agent to sell the crop for their joint benefit and account to the landlord for his share out of
                            the proceeds of sale. It is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded with certainty and particularity and established by the greater weight of the evidence. Hall v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 66</cite>,

                            Landlord Estopped to Assert Claim. - Where a landlord who retained a lien on tobacco grown by his tenant gave his AAA marketing card to his tenant in order that he might sell the tobacco in a warehouse, the landlord clothed the tenant with authority or
                            apparent authority to receive payment for the tobacco, and was estopped to assert a claim against the warehouse for the amount of his lien thereon. Adams v. Growers' Whse., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 704</cite>,

                            acquired no tobacco from his tenant that comes within the provisions of his membership contract in the Tobacco Growers Co-operative Association, and is not liable for the penalty therein contained for failure to market the

                            Tenant Has Insurable Interest. - The fact that the possession and title to the crop are deemed vested in the landlord does not divest the tenant of an insurable interest in the crops before division. Batts v. Sullivan,
                            <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 129</cite>, 108 S.E. 511 (1921).

                            When Crop to Be Divided. - Unless otherwise provided by agreement, the crop should be divided from time to time, as considerable parts thereof shall be gathered, especially where the gathering of the whole is delayed for a considerable length of time.
                            Smith v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 88</cite>, 12 S.E. 121 (1890).

                            Crop Left in Field. - A crop cultivated by a tenant and left standing in the field after the expiration of his term becomes the property of the landlord, and this is so, whether or not the tenant has assigned the crop. Sanders v. Ellington,

                            What Are "Advancements" - In General. - The "advancements" referred to in this section embrace anything of value supplied by the landlord to the tenant or cropper in good faith, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of making and saving the crop. Brown
                            v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 124</cite>, 13 S.E. 797 (1891).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where a landlord either pays or becomes responsible for supplies to enable the tenant to make a crop, such supplies are advances. Powell v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 22</cite>, 37 S.E. 71 (1900).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Supplies necessary to make and save a crop are such articles as are in good faith furnished to and received by the tenant for that purpose. Ledbetter v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 276</cite> (1884).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Supplies Necessary to Cultivation of Crop. - When advancements are of such things as in their nature are appropriate and necessary to the cultivation of the crop, e.g., farming implements and work animals, they will be presumed to create the lien; but
                            where they are of articles not in themselves so appropriate and necessary, e.g., dry goods and groceries, whether they will constitute a lien depends upon the purpose for which they were furnished, and it must affirmatively
                            appear that they were made in aid of the crop. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 124</cite>, 13 S.E. 797 (1891).

                            What Are "Advancements" - Question for Jury. - It was proper in the court to leave it to the jury to find whether upon the evidence a mule and wagon, etc., were treated as advancements. Ledbetter v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 276</cite>                            (1884).

                        <p>
                            Fact that lessee diverts advancements from the purpose contemplated cannot change their nature and the purpose of them. Womble v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 84</cite> (1880); Ledbetter v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 276</cite>                            (1884); Brown v.

                        <p>
                            Where a landlord furnished advancements for the making of crops, the liens for the rent and for advancements were in equal degree, and attached, since the 1925 amendment of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.044.html#t44a10s44-52" target="_blank">G.S. 44-52</a></cite>,
                            to the crops raised by the tenant on the same lands, planted during one calendar year and harvested in the next. Brooks v. Garrett, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 452</cite>, 142 S.E. 486 (1928).

                        <p>
                            Advancement of Cottonseed. - Where landlord advanced certain cottonseed, etc., to his tenant in 1884, and in 1885 and 1886 allowed his tenant to retain parts of the undivided cottonseed and crops by way of advancement, it was held that the plaintiff had
                            a landlord's lien on such seed and crops. Thigpen v. Maget, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 39</cite>, 12 S.E. 272 (1890).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Where the landlord supplied the tenant and his family with board, to the end that he might make and save the crop, nothing to the contrary appearing, the reasonable value of such board would constitute an advancement within the meaning of this section.
                            Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 124</cite>, 13 S.E. 797 (1891).

                            Collusion and Fraud in Creating "Advancements." - Where landlord and tenants undertake by collusion and fraud to create an indebtedness to the former, under color of "advancements," to the prejudice of creditors of the tenant, such a transaction will
                            not be sustained. Ledbetter v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 276</cite> (1884).

                        <p>
                            Advances to Sublessee. - The original lessor, after his lessee has paid him in full, has no lien under the statute on the crop of his sublessee for advances made by him to the sublessee. Moore v. Faison, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 322</cite>,
                            2 S.E. 169 (1887).

                        <p>
                            Lien of Third Party for Advances. - The lien of a landlord takes precedence to that of a third party for advances, notwithstanding the priority of the latter in time. Spruill v. Arrington, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 192</cite>,
                            13 S.E. 779 (1891); Crinkley v. Egerton, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 444</cite>, 18 S.E. 669 (1893). See also, Wooten v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 48</cite>, 3 S.E. 846 (1887); Wise Supply Co. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 328</cite>,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The statutory landlord's lien under this section was superior to that of one furnishing supplies to the cropper under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.044.html#t44a10s44-52" target="_blank">G.S. 44-52</a></cite>;
                            but where the cropper under a separate contract with the landlord raised a certain crop, the lien for advancements attached to such crop, and where the landlord received payment for the entire crop including the special crop
                            under separate contract with the cropper and paid himself the amount due as rent, the lien for advancements attached to the surplus and the holder of the lien could recover thereon from the landlord. Glover v. Dail, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 659</cite>,
                            155 S.E. 575 (1930).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A contract expressed and purporting to be a lease of lands for agricultural purposes does not change the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties upon the ground that if the amount of stipulated rent should be paid at a certain time it
                            should be regarded as a credit upon the purchase of the land at a stated price, it not appearing that the transaction of the contemplated purchase had been made under option given; and the landlord or one to whom the contract
                            had been validly assigned could enforce his lien under this section in priority to the lien, under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.044.html#t44a10s44-52" target="_blank">G.S. 44-52</a></cite>,
                            of one furnishing advancements for the cultivation of the crop. Wise Supply Co. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 328</cite>, 139 S.E. 599 (1927).

         IV. REMEDY OF LESSOR.

                            Remedies for Unauthorized Removal of Crop by Tenant. - An attempt to appropriate and carry off the crop may be repelled by the landlord by force, provided no more force is used than is necessary to protect his possession. State v. Austin,
                            <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 749</cite>, 31 S.E. 731 (1898).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This section vests the possession of the crop in the landlord, and, under this right of possession, he has the right to use force, if necessary, to prevent unauthorized removal by the tenant. Moreover, if the tenant, without the consent of the landlord,
                            willfully removes the crop without giving five days' notice of removal, before satisfying the landlord's lien, he is guilty of a misdemeanor under G.S. 42-22. In such case, the tenant is liable both civilly and criminally;
                            for the constructive possession of the crop is in the landlord. Hall v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 66</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 129 (1954).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The landlord may bring claim and delivery to recover possession of crops raised by the tenant or cropper, where his right of possession under this section is denied, or he may resort to any other appropriate remedy to enforce his lien for the rent due
                            and the advances made. Livingston v. Farish, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 140</cite> (1883).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Action Lies. - The action will lie, not only where the crops are removed from the land leased, but also in a case where the tenant or cropper, or any other person, takes the crops into his absolute possession and denies the right of the landlord
                            thereto. Livingston v. Farish, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 140</cite> (1883).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The remedy of claim and delivery was designated for the landlord's protection, and it cannot, either by the terms of the statute or by any fair construction, be resorted to before the time fixed for division, unless the tenant is about to remove or dispose
                            of the crop, or abandon a growing crop; otherwise, the tenant might be sued for parcel of the crop as it was gathered. Neither the language nor the spirit of the statute will permit this. Jordan v. Bryan,
                            <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. 59</cite>, 9 S.E. 135 (1889).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where, in a contract between the landlord and tenant, no time was fixed for division of the crop, the landlord was not obliged to wait until the whole crop had been gathered, but had a right to bring his action for the possession of the crop before it
                            was fully harvested. Smith v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 88</cite>, 12 S.E. 121 (1890); Rich v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 79</cite>, 16 S.E. 931 (1893).

                        <p>
                            Action for Undivided Portion. - The lessor can maintain an action for recovery of an undivided portion of a crop, and it is not necessary that he shall specifically designate in his complaint or affidavit in claim and delivery such undivided part. Boone
                            v. Darden, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 74</cite>, 13 S.E. 728 (1891).

                        <p>
                            Denial of Landlord's Title. - Where, in his answer in an action of claim and delivery, the defendant tenant denies that the crop for the possession of which the action is brought is vested in the plaintiff landlord, such denial avoids the necessity of
                            proving a demand before the commencement of the action. Rich v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 79</cite>, 16 S.E. 931 (1893).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            No Right to Personal Property Exemption. - The right to enforce the landlord's lien cannot be defeated by the lessee claiming the crop as a part of his personal property exemption. Durham v. Speeke, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 87</cite>                            (1880).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The landlord's lien extends to and includes the costs of such legal proceedings as are necessary to recover his rents; and, as all the crops are his until such lien is duly discharged, the tenant has no property therein which he can claim as his constitutional
                            exemption as against such costs. Slaughter v. Winfrey, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 159</cite> (1881).

                            Liability of Warehouse Purchasing from Tenant or Selling as His Agent. - Nothing else appearing, if a warehouse purchased tobacco from a tenant, or sold the tobacco as agent for the tenant, and paid the tenant therefor, without regard to the landlord's
                            lien, the warehouse would be accountable to the landlord on the basis of money had and received for the proceeds of sale up to the balance due as rent. Hall v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 66</cite>,
                            81 S.E.2d 129 (1954).

                            Tenant's Liability. - If the tenant, at any time before satisfying the landlord's liens for rent and advances, removes the crop, or any part of it, he becomes liable civilly and criminally. Jordan v. Bryan, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. 59</cite>,

                        Purpose of Section. - This section intends to encourage and favor the laborer as to those matters and things upon which his labor has been bestowed, so that he may reap the just benefit of his toil. Rouse v. Wooten, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 229</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Creation of Lien. - While one who labors in the cultivation of a crop, under a contract that he shall receive his compensation from the crop when matured and gathered, has no estate or interest in the land, but is simply a laborer - at most, a cropper
                        - his right to receive his share is protected by this section, which for certain purposes creates a lien in his favor, which will be enforced against the employer or landlord or his assigns, and which has precedence over agricultural
                        liens made subsequent to his contract, but before the crop is harvested. Rouse v. Wooten, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 229</cite>, 10 S.E. 190 (1889).

                    <p>
                        Seizure of Crop by Lessor. - The lessor has no right, when there is no agreement to that effect, to take actual possession from the lessee or cropper, and can never do so, except when he obtains the same by an action of claim and delivery, upon the removal
                        of the crop by the lessee or cropper. State v. Copeland, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 691</cite> (1882).

                    <p>
                        Where Lessor Seizes Too Much. - If a lessor seizes more than enough to satisfy his lien, and refuses to make a fair division of the crop, the lessee or cropper can compel him to do so in the manner prescribed in this section. Boone v. Darden,
                        <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 74</cite>, 13 S.E. 728 (1891).

                    <p>
                        Lessee Left to Civil Remedy. - When the lessee is wrongfully deprived of the actual possession of his crop by the lessor, he is left to his civil remedy under this section for the breach of trust, should the lessor refuse to account. State v. Keith,
                        <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 1114</cite>, 36 S.E. 169 (1900).

                    <p>
                        By Claim and Delivery. - Where a lessor gets possession of the crop by his own act, the remedy of the lessee to recover his part thereof is by claim and delivery. Wilson v. Respass, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 112</cite> (1882).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Against Whom Action May Be Brought. - The action allowed to a cropper by this section is given against the lessor or employer, and also against any person to whom he may assign or sell the crop, or any interest therein, as, for example, the person who
                        might have an "agricultural lien" upon it, acquired subsequently to the making of the contract with the cropper. Rouse v. Wooten, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 229</cite>, 10 S.E. 190 (1889).

                        Trover Held Improper. - Where a landlord took the crop into his sole possession, and refused to divide it when it was demanded, on the ground that the crop was not then in condition for a division, but he did not deny the tenant's right to a division,
                        and while in his possession the crop was destroyed by fire, it was held that this did not amount to a conversion, and an action in the nature of trover could not be maintained. Shearin v. Riggsbee,

                        Purpose. - The purpose of this section and G.S. 42-18 is to provide a summary mode for ascertaining a disputed liability, and, in case of delay, to secure the fruits of the judgment by requiring of the lessee, as a condition of his remaining in possession
                        of the property, an adequate undertaking for the payment of what may be recovered. Deloatch v. Coman, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 186</cite> (1884).

                        of the lessee, cropper or assignee of either, and this intent is very clearly expressed in the terms used in the enactment. It is a method of settling a controversy without resort to the possessory actions authorized in the antecedent

                        sustained by reason of the inability of the lessee to perform his contract. Parker v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 280</cite>, 48 S.E. 657 (1904).

                    subject to the decision of the court upon the issue or issues pending between the parties.

                            Purpose. - The purpose of this section is to render the statutory provisions and regulations of the preceding sections more effective, and this penal provision must be interpreted in that light and in that view. It embraces both the landlord and the tenant,
                            and intends the more effectually to secure their respective rights as prescribed. State v. Ewing, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 755</cite>, 13 S.E. 10 (1981).

                            The leading and material part of the purpose of this section is to keep the crops on the land, so that they may be easily seen, known, identified and protected, and to prevent fraud and fraudulent practices that would be greatly facilitated by removing
                            them from the land to any distance. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 646</cite>, 10 S.E. 901 (1890).

                            Actual Seizure Unnecessary. - To constitute the offense of an unlawful seizure of crops by a landlord under this section, it is not essential that the landlord should take forcible or even manual possession of them; the offense will be complete if he
                            exercises that possession or control which prevents the tenant from gathering and removing his crop in a peaceable manner. State v. Ewing, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 755</cite>, 13 S.E. 10 (1891).

                            Removal of Crops Is a Misdemeanor Only. - The offense of removing crops, without payment or notice of such removal, although it may have been committed secretly, or at night, is a simple misdemeanor, and cannot be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary.
                            State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 920</cite> (1886).

                        <p>
                            Larceny of Crops. - An indictment for larceny will not lie against a lessee or cropper for secretly appropriating the crop to his own use, even if done with a felonious intent, where he is in the actual possession of the same. State v. Copeland,
                            <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 691</cite> (1882).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An indictment for larceny will lie against a lessee or cropper for secretly appropriating the crop to his own use, where his actual possession thereof has terminated by a delivery to the landlord. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 558</cite>                            (1882).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the crop is in the actual possession of the landlord, though undivided, the tenant may be convicted of larceny for feloniously taking and carrying it away; and the ownership of the property will be laid properly in the name of the landlord. State v.
                            King, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 648</cite>, 4 S.E. 44 (1887).

                        <p>
                            Gathering the Crop. - How far the tenant might be justified under the statute in severing the crops from the land and storing them on it simply for the purpose of protection to them has been doubtful, but it has been held that he may do so in good faith
                            for such purpose; he may not go beyond that. Varner v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 381</cite> (1875); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 646</cite>, 10 S.E. 901 (1890).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The gathering and preservation of crops was not the evil intended to be remedied by this section, but rather, the wrongful appropriation, whether by carrying them off the premises or consuming them on the premises. Varner v. Spencer,
                            <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 381</cite> (1875).

                        <p>
                            Feeding Crop to Stock. - Where a lessee, after putting a crop in the crib, converted a portion thereof to his own use by feeding it to his stock without the consent of the landlord, this was a removal within the meaning of this section and was indictable.
                            Varner v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 381</cite> (1875).

                        <p>
                            Removal from Premises. - Where a tenant, without the consent of, or notice to, his landlord, and before satisfying the latter's lien, removed a portion of the crop from the land upon which it was produced and stored it in a building upon the tenant's
                            own land, it was held that he was guilty of unlawfully removing crops, notwithstanding the fact that he made the removal for the purpose of sheltering the crop, and kept it separate from others. State v. Williams,
                            <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 646</cite>, 10 S.E. 901 (1890).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If it becomes necessary, in possible cases, to remove crops from the land for their protection, this should be done on notice, or legal steps taken as contemplated and allowed by the statute. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 646</cite>,
                            10 S.E. 901 (1890).

                        <p>
                            Intent Is Immaterial. - While the obvious purpose of this section is the protection of the lessor's interest against a fraudulent disposition or appropriation of the property, inconsistent with his right and tending to defeat his lien for rent, the wrongful
                            intent is not a constituent of the criminal act described, and the offense is sufficiently charged in the substantial words of the act. State v. Pender, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 651</cite> (1880).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The intent in making the removal is immaterial. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 646</cite>, 10 S.E. 901 (1890); State v. Crook, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 1053</cite>, 44 S.E. 32 (1903).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Intent Implied from Act. - The statute broadly forbids the removal of the crops, or any part of them, from the land, except in the case and in the way prescribed, and that without regard to the actual intent. The removal implies the intent to commit the
                            offense. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 646</cite>, 10 S.E. 901 (1890).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lack of Notice Part of Offense. - The offense of removing a crop by a tenant before paying the rent and discharging all liens of the landlord on it is not complete unless the crop is removed without giving the five days' notice, for if the notice is given,
                            removing the crop is not an offense. State v. Crowder, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 432</cite>, 1 S.E. 690 (1887).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to convict the defendant of the offense of removing a crop without the consent of the landlord, the burden is on the State to show that the defendant had not given his landlord the statutory five days' previous notice before the crop had been
                            removed. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 267</cite>, 76 S.E. 683 (1912).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How Want of Notice Proven. - The want of notice may be proved by any competent evidence, and it is not necessary that it should be proved by the landlord or his agent or assignee. State v. Crowder, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 432</cite>,
                            1 S.E. 690 (1887).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a tenant aids and abets a subtenant in removing a crop, before paying the lien of the landlord, he is guilty of a misdemeanor. State v. Crook, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 1053</cite>, 44 S.E. 32 (1903).
                            <br />

                            Landlord's Failure to Comply with Contract No Defense. - A tenant indicted for removal of crops without giving the landlord five days' notice cannot show in defense that he had sustained damage by the failure of the landlord to comply with the contract

                        <p>
                            Indictment Must Follow. - An indictment under this section charging the defendant with removing the crop "without satisfying all liens on said crop" is defective. The words of the statute, "before satisfying all liens held by the lessor or his assigns
                            on said crop," should have been followed. State v. Merritt, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 506</cite> (1883); State v. Rose, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 712</cite> (1884).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sufficient Averments. - In an indictment under this section, it is sufficient to aver, in the words of the statute, that the act was done, "willfully and unlawfully," leaving it to the defendant to show in excuse, if he can, that such removal was made
                            in good faith and for the preservation of the crop. State v. Pender, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 651</cite> (1880).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An averment in an indictment for removing a crop "without having given any notice of such intended removal" is equivalent to the averment that the removal was made without giving "five days' notice." State v. Powell,
                            <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 920</cite> (1886).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where an indictment for removing a crop alleged that the defendants did "rent from B," and subsequently, that he did "remove the crop without satisfying all liens held by said B," it was held that this, in effect, sufficiently charged the relation of
                            landlord and tenant, and that the "liens held by the lessor" were unpaid at the time of the alleged unlawful removal. State v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 91</cite>, 10 S.E. 1026 (1890).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this section the word "crop" includes those ungathered as well as those gathered, and an indictment charging that the landlord seized the "crop growing and unmatured in the field," etc., charges an indictable offense, when it is otherwise sufficient.
                            State v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 696</cite>, 86 S.E. 718 (1915).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Allegation as to Lien. - It is not necessary to allege, in an indictment under this section, that the lessor or landlord had a lien on the crop, where the bill contains an averment of the lease and of the relation of landlord and tenant, or cropper. By
                            virtue of the statute the law implies a lien, and of this the courts will take notice. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 653</cite>, 11 S.E. 166 (1890), distinguishing State v. Merritt,
                            <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 506</cite> (1883). See State v. Rose, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 712</cite> (1884).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In an indictment for removing a crop, it is not necessary to negative the fact that, by agreement between the parties, it was stipulated that the crops should not be subjected to the statutory liens. State v. Turner,
                            <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 91</cite>, 10 S.E. 1026 (1890).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Variance Not Shown. - Where an indictment for removal of crops without notice to the landlord charged an agreement by the defendant to raise a crop on the land of G, and on the trial the proof showed the title to be in another, who rented the land to
                            G, it was held that there was no variance. State v. Foushee, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 766</cite>, 23 S.E. 247 (1895).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Arrest of Judgment. - When on the trial it was proved that the defendants, who were indicted as third persons for removing the crop, had a license from the tenant, from whom they bought the crop, but such fact was not charged in the indictment, the judgment
                            would be arrested. State v. Sears, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 295</cite> (1874).

                <p>
                    All agricultural leases and contracts hereafter made between landlord and tenant for a period of one year or from year to year, whether such tenant pay a specified rental or share in the crops grown, such year shall be from December first to December
                    first, and such period of time shall constitute a year for agricultural tenancies in lieu of the law and custom heretofore prevailing, namely from January first to January first. In all cases of such tenancies a notice to quit of one
                    month as provided in G.S. 42-14 shall be applicable. If on account of illness or any other good cause, the tenant is unable to harvest all the crops grown on lands leased by him for any year prior to the termination of his lease contract
                    on December first, he shall have a right to return to the premises vacated by him at any time prior to December thirty-first of said year, for the purpose only of harvesting and dividing the remaining crops so ungathered. But he shall
                    have no right to use the houses or outbuildings or that part of the lands from which the crops have been harvested prior to the termination of the tenant year, as defined in this section.

                        Applicability. - For a lease to fall within this section it must be both (1) for an agricultural purpose, and (2) for a period of one year or from year to year. Lewis v.

                        When Notice Must Be Given. - Because this section prescribes December 1 as the expiration of the lease year, notice must be given by the preceding November 1. Lewis v.

                    <p>
                        This Article prohibits landlord self-help eviction where residential tenancies are involved. Baker v. Rushing, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 240, 409 S.E.2d 108 (1991).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        North Carolina law requires eviction of residential tenants to be accomplished through court action; thus, in federally subsidized housing cases, the court decides whether applicable rules and regulations have been followed and whether termination of
                        the lease is permissible. Charlotte Hous. Auth. v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 464 S.E.2d 68 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Burden of Persuasion. - Dismissal of a summary ejectment action was error because a trial court held the landlord to a clear, cogent, and convincing evidence standard, and in a summary ejectment action, the landlord's burden of persuasion was by the preponderance
                        of the evidence as set forth in G.S. 42-30; this standard also applied to appeals of summary ejectment actions in the district court. Durham Hosiery Mill Ltd. P'ship v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite>                        590, 720 S.E.2d 426 (2011).

                    <p>
                        The landlord's exclusive remedy to regain possession of house is by means of statutory summary ejectment proceedings pursuant to G.S. 42-26 to 42-36.1. Dobbins v. Paul, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 321 S.E.2d
                        537 (1984), overruled on other grounds, Stanley v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 717</cite>, 454 S.E.2d 225 (1995).

                        Residents of Hotel. - Where each plaintiff resided in hotel pursuant to an oral lease and leased his apartment as his sole and permanent residence, some plaintiffs had resided in the building for as long as six years, and the payments for the apartments
                        were made weekly and were referred to by each party as "rent," at a minimum, the evidence presented genuine issues of material fact regarding plaintiffs' status as residential tenants, and for this reason, summary judgment was
                        improperly granted. Baker v. Rushing, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 240, 409 S.E.2d 108 (1991).

                        The landlord's exclusive remedy to regain possession of house is by means of statutory summary ejectment proceedings pursuant to G.S. 42-26 to 42-36.1. Dobbins v. Paul, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 321 S.E.2d

                        Waiting Period. - Trial court erred in dismissing a former owner's conversion claim against a foreclosing lender and its property manager because the parties could not satisfy the statutory 10-day waiting period by agreeing to a modified timeline where
                        such an agreement violated public policy and was void, and nothing suggested that the former owner had only one opportunity to obtain possession of her personal property during the 10-day period. Heaton-Sides v. Snipes,

        Tenant's Judgment Nondischargeable.
       </b> - Tenant's state court judgment was nondischargeable due to embezzlement under bankruptcy law as although the debtor as a landlord had the right to padlock the property and to possess the tenant's personal property,
                        he also had a legal obligation to release the property to the tenant; the debtor's claim that the tenant made no demand for his personal property was not credible and the debtor's actions involved moral turpitude as he actively
                        ignored the tenant and disposed of the property, without authorization, before the expiration of the 10-day period under G.S. 42-25.9 and G.S. 42-36.2. In re Reid, - Bankr. - (Bankr. M.D.N.C. Feb. 11, 2016).

    §
   </span> 1437d(l)(6), based on a guest's drug activity, was properly denied because (1) G.S. 42-26(a)(2) governed summary eviction, which required, inter alia, that the eviction not be unconscionable, and, (2) the federal
                            statute did not preempt the unconscionability provision, as the provision did not conflict with or stand as an obstacle to achieving the federal statute's purpose, since the statute gave housing authorities discretion to evict,
                            instead of requiring eviction, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development encouraged the consideration of individual circumstances. E. Carolina Reg'l Hous.

                            Summary Ejectment Inappropriate. - Summary ejectment was inappropriate because a federally subsidized housing authority failed to exercise its discretion as required by federal law before pursuing a tenant's eviction; neither the federal statutory framework
                            nor the housing authority's lease or policies compelled eviction, but instead, they only delineated the grounds or cause for eviction. E. Carolina Reg'l Hous. Auth. v. Lofton, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 8</cite>,

                            Jurisdiction Is Statutory. - Jurisdiction in summary ejectment proceedings is purely statutory, and may be exercised only in cases where the relationship of landlord and tenant exists, and the tenant holds over after the expiration of his term, or has
                            otherwise violated the provisions of his lease. Howell v. Branson, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 264</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 687 (1946); Goins v. McLoud, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 655</cite>, 46

                        <p>
                            A court, in conducting summary ejectment proceedings, derives its jurisdiction solely from this statute, and it may exercise such jurisdiction only where a relationship of landlord and tenant exists and where one of three statutory violations occurs.

                            Trial court had jurisdiction pursuant to G.S. 42-26 over dispute between plaintiff landlord and defendant tenant involving a commercial lease, as that section had been applied to the summary ejectment of commercial tenants and plaintiff had sought summary
                            ejectment of defendant for defendant's nonpayment of rent. ARE-100/800/801 Capitola, LLC v. Triangle Labs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 550 S.E.2d 31 (2001).

                            Under subdivision (2), a breach of the lease cannot be made the basis of summary ejectment unless the lease itself provides for termination by such breach or reserves a right of reentry for such breach. Stanley v. Harvey,
                            <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 535, 369 S.E.2d 382 (1988).

                            Burden of Persuasion. - Dismissal of a summary ejectment action was error because a trial court held the landlord to a clear, cogent, and convincing evidence standard, and in a summary ejectment action, the landlord's burden of persuasion was by the preponderance
                            of the evidence as set forth in G.S. 42-30; this standard also applied to appeals of summary ejectment actions in the district court. Durham Hosiery Mill Ltd. P'ship v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite>                            590, 720 S.E.2d 426 (2011).

                            Under this section, it is no longer necessary to allege that a landlord-tenant relationship exists between parties as jurisdictional matter, but it is still necessary to show that the relationship exists in order to bring the case within the provisions
                            of this section before the summary ejectment remedy may be properly granted. Jones v. Swain, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 663, 367 S.E.2d 136 (1988).

                            Allegation of Landlord-Tenant Relationship. - Under this section, it is no longer necessary to allege that a landlord-tenant relationship exists between the parties as a jurisdictional matter, but it is still necessary to show that the relationship exists
                            in order to bring the case within the provisions of this section before the summary ejectment remedy may be properly granted. Jones v. Swain, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 663, 367 S.E.2d

                            Right to Renew Lease. - A tenant, in the absence of an agreement, has neither a legal nor an equitable right to a renewal of the lease. Barnes v. Saleeby, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 256</cite>, 98 S.E. 708 (1919).

                            No Consideration for Option to Renew. - An option in the original lease to renew would not be without consideration, but landlord's agreement during the lease, not constituting part of the lease, not to lease the property without first giving the tenant
                            an opportunity to renew the lease was unenforcable, being without consideration. Barnes v. Saleeby, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 256</cite>, 98 S.E. 708 (1919).

         The hearing to be afforded tenants of public housing before the determination to evict them

                            When the remedy of summary ejectment is sought, the allegation that the relationship of landlord and tenant exists between the parties is no longer necessary as a jurisdictional matter, but it is still necessary to show that the relationship exists in
                            order to bring the case within the provisions of this section before the remedy may be properly granted. Chandler v. Cleveland Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 455,

                            The remedy by summary proceedings in ejectment given by this section is not coextensive with the doctrine of estoppel arising where one enters and holds land under another, but is restricted to the case where the relation between the parties is simply
                            that of landlord and tenant. Hauser v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 248</cite>, 59 S.E. 693 (1907); McLaurin v. McIntyre, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 350</cite>, 83 S.E. 627 (1914).

                            Some Contract or Lease Required. - This section was only intended to apply to a case in which the tenant entered into possession under some contract or lease, either actual or implied, with the supposed landlord, or with some person under whom the landlord
                            claimed in privity, or where the tenant himself is in privity with some person who had so entered. McCombs v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 481</cite> (1872).

                        <p>
                            Trial court erred by granting the new owner of a rental house summary ejectment relief pursuant to G.S. 42-26, because no lease contract existed between the new owner and the tenants who were ordered to surrender possession, and subject matter jurisdiction
                            in a summary ejectment proceeding was premises on an enforceable contract. Adams v. Woods, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 609 S.E.2d 429 (2005).

                            Definite Term Not Necessary. - Summary ejectment will lie only where the relationship of landlord and tenant existed between the parties under a lease contract, express or implied, and the tenant has held over after the expiration of the term, but while
                            it is necessary that the tenant's entry should have been under a demise, it need not be for a definite term, a tenancy at will being sufficient. Simons v. Lebrun, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 42</cite>,

                            Lessor Must Terminate Lessee's Estate Before Commencing Summary Ejectment Action. - The trial court erred in granting lessor summary ejectment of lessee since lessor's letter to lessee did not amount to notice that lease was terminated and lessor must
                            terminate lessee's estate before commencing on summary ejectment action. Stanley v. Harvey, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 535, 369 S.E.2d 382 (1988).

                            Summary Ejectment of Tenants at Will. - When a landlord tells tenants at will to vacate the premises, their tenancy instantly expires, regardless of whether they have defaulted on the rent, and the landlord has the right to bring an immediate action for
                            summary ejectment under this section. Stout v. Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 204 S.E.2d 541, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 595</cite>, 205 S.E.2d 726

                            that he should actually surrender the possession of the land and receive it again at the hands of the lessor. Riley v. Jordan, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 180</cite> (1876).

                            Obligation to Pay Rent. - Where lease did not contain a provision expressly holding the tenant liable for future rents after ejectment, the lease was terminated when defendants were removed and the landlord was placed in possession pursuant to the summary
                            ejectment proceeding, and thus defendants' obligation to pay future rent was also terminated. Holly Farm Foods, Inc. v. Kuykendall, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 442 S.E.2d 94 (1994).

                            When Section Does Not Apply - Generally. - The remedy by summary ejectment under this and the following sections is not available when there is a relation of mortgagor and mortgagee or vendor and vendee. McLaurin v. McIntyre,
                            <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 350</cite>, 83 S.E. 627 (1914).

                            The construction of this section excludes two classes, namely, vendees in possession under a contract for title and vendors retaining possession after a sale, even though such persons are tenants at will or sufferance for some purposes, and are frequently
                            so styled. McCombs v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 481</cite> (1872).

                            When Section Does Not Apply - Title Disputes. - Where a controversy involved the disputed title to real property, out of which certain equities arose, this section did not apply. McLaurin v. McIntyre, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 350</cite>,
                            83 S.E. 627 (1914).

                            When title to property is in issue, the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace (now magistrate) is ousted, and the proceeding is properly dismissed as in case of nonsuit upon appeal to the superior (now district) court. Prudential Ins. Co. v. Totten,
                            <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 431</cite>, 166 S.E. 316 (1932); Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 515</cite>, 177 S.E. 633 (1935).

                            Plaintiff acquired a quitclaim deed to defendants' property at a tax sale and then attempted to quiet title or to establish title to the property through a summary ejectment proceeding. This was simply the wrong action to quiet title and, because the
                            plaintiff and defendants were not in a landlord-tenant relationship, the wrong circumstance under which to bring an action in summary ejectment. College Heights Credit Union v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite>                            494, 409 S.E.2d 742 (1991).

                            When Section Does Not Apply - Bargainor in Deed of Trust. - A bargainor in a deed of trust containing a stipulation of the retention of the possession of the land conveyed until sold under the terms of the trust, who holds possession after a sale of the
                            premises by a trustee, is not such a tenant as comes within the purview of this section, and hence proceedings cannot be taken thereunder to evict him. McCombs v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 481</cite>                            (1872).

                            When Section Does Not Apply - Entry as Vendee. - Where a party entered land under a contract of purchase, while he is so possessed a justice of the peace (now magistrate) has no jurisdiction to oust him under this section. McCombs v. Wallace,
                            <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 481</cite> (1872); McMillan v. Love, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 18</cite> (1875); Riley v. Jordan, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 180</cite> (1876).

                            A vendee under a contract for sale and purchase of land is not such a tenant as may be evicted by summary ejectment under this section. Brannock v. Fletcher, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 65</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 532 (1967).

                        <p>
                            If a vendee, after cancellation, of a contract for the sale of property, continues in possession, he is regarded as a tenant at sufferance, and is properly subject to ejectment under this section. Marantz Piano Co. v. Kincaid,
                            <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 424 S.E.2d 671 (1993).

                            Who May Bring Action. - The landlord under whom a tenant has entered into possession of the leased premises is the proper person to bring a summary action of ejectment to dispossess the tenant holding over after the expiration of his lease, upon proper
                            notice to vacate, and the objection of the tenant that the landlord has again leased the premises to another to begin immediately upon the expiration of his term, and that the second lessee is the only one who can maintain
                            the proceedings in ejectment, is untenable. Shelton v. Clinard, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 664</cite>, 122 S.E. 477 (1924).

                            Estoppel to Deny Landlord's Title. - A tenant cannot dispute the title of his landlord, either by setting up a title in himself or a third person, during the existence of the lease or tenancy. Lawrence v. Eller, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 211</cite>,
                            85 S.E. 291 (1915). See also, Steadman v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 388</cite> (1871).

                        <p>
                            Neither the tenant nor any person claiming title by or through him can dispute the right of the landlord to recover the premises in ejectment, after the expiration of the lease, upon the ground of a defect of title in the landlord. Callendar v. Sherman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. 711</cite> (1845).

                        <p>
                            Where the relation of landlord and tenant is established, and the latter is in possession, the tenant will not be permitted to dispute the title of the landlord during the continuance of the lease. Hobby v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 240</cite>,

                            In a proceeding before a justice of the peace (now magistrate) under this section, a defendant who does not deny having entered as the tenant of the plaintiff is estopped from setting up a superior title existing at the date of the lease or subsequently
                            acquired from a third person. Heyer v. Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 28</cite> (1877).

                            A suit to restrain execution on a judgment in summary ejectment by a justice of the peace (now magistrate) on the ground that the justice had no jurisdiction was properly dismissed where it appeared that plaintiff, formerly the mortgagor of the property,
                            had leased the property and was estopped from attacking the foreclosure and setting up the relation of mortgagor and mortgagee. Shuford v. Greensboro Joint-Stock Land Bank, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 428</cite>,

                            Consideration of Equitable Defenses. - A justice of the peace (now magistrate) has jurisdiction of a summary action in ejectment, and may determine the questions of tenancy and holding over, and while he has no equitable jurisdiction, he may consider
                            equitable defenses set up in a summary ejectment insofar as they relate to the issue of tenancy. Farmville Oil &amp; Fertilizer Co. v. Bowen, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 375</cite>, 168 S.E. 211

                            Provision for Renewal as Defense. - While a provision of renewal of a lease is not itself a renewal so as to vest an estate, yet it gives an equity which may be set up as a defense in a summary proceeding in ejectment. While the court allows this equitable
                            defense to the summary proceedings, the defendants must pay the accrued rent. McAdoo v. Callum Bros. &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 419</cite> (1882).

                            Claim in Respect to Improvements Outside Scope of Proceeding. - Evidence that the relationship of landlord and tenant existed between the parties and that defendants were holding over after the expiration of the term was sufficient to take the case to
                            the jury and support a judgment for plaintiff in summary ejectment, and defendants' claim in respect to improvements was outside the scope of the proceeding and not justiciable therein. Ford v. Ford Moulding Co.,

                            Defendant tenant's estate had not ceased pursuant to G.S. 42-26(2), and thus, plaintiff was not entitled to summarily eject defendant, where the reason the estate had not terminated was that plaintiff's written notice to defendant upon defendant's default
                            of commercial lease for nonpayment of rent did not comply with any of the three methods existing in the lease, but merely stated that plaintiff would be pursuing "curative remedies under the lease and the law." ARE-100/800/801

                            "Unconscionable." - When determining whether a summary eviction was "unconscionable," the term "unconscionable" meant excessive, unreasonable or shockingly unfair or unjust.

                            A lessor has three separate remedies under this Article: (i) possession of the premises; (ii) an award of unpaid rent; and (iii) an award of damages for the tenant's occupation of the premises after the cessation of the estate. Chrisalis Properties, Inc.

                            All Damages Must Be Recovered in One Action. - The fact that this Article specifically allows a lessor to bring an action to regain possession of the premises separate from an action for damages does not create an exception to the general rule that all
                            damages must be recovered in one action. Chrisalis Properties, Inc. v. Separate Quarters, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 81, 398 S.E.2d 628 (1990), discretionary review denied,

                            Superior Court Has Original Jurisdiction. - When the legislature created the district court division and gave it concurrent original jurisdiction over all matters except probate and matters of decedents' estates, it did not thereby divest the superior
                            court division of any of its original jurisdiction; hence, the superior court division has original jurisdiction over summary ejectment actions.

                            Court Had No Jurisdiction Where Daughter Was Not a Tenant. - Where lease described mother as the head of the household and "Tenant," and where daughter was listed as a member of the household, trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction under

                            had been disposed of by the surrender of same by defendants to plaintiffs and no other question was raised in the court below, appeal would be dismissed. Cochran v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 645</cite>,

                            of the lessor's termination of the lease since there was no genuine issue of material fact that the lessor's president was acting in at least a de facto capacity as president when she terminated the lease or that the lessor,
                            as a corporation, had an officer with the title of president; in her affidavit, the president averred that she was validly elected by the lessor's members and was acting in that capacity when she terminated the lease. Havelock

                            Constitutionality. - The summary ejectment procedure as set out in subdivision (1) of this section and G.S. 42-32 is not unconstitutional on grounds that subdivision (1) provides no defense whatsoever to a residential tenant of commercially owned property
                            who holds over after being given notice that the term has expired or that the owner desires possession. Twin City Apts., Inc. v. Landrum, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 490, 263 S.E.2d
                            323 (1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subdivision (1) of this section, as to a tenant holding over, was declared constitutional in Credle v. Gibbs, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 192</cite> (1871).

                        <p>
                            Subdivision (1) of this section provides no defense because none exists. Once the estate of the lessee expires, the lessor, by virtue of his superior title, may resume possession by following proper procedures. Defendant's right to possession is protected
                            by virtue of G.S. 42-35 and G.S. 42-36, which provide a remedy to the tenant if he is evicted, but later restored to possession. Twin City Apts., Inc. v. Landrum, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite>                            490, 263 S.E.2d 323 (1980).

                            Effect of Recognition of Tenant Holding Over. - When a tenant for a year or a longer time holds over and is recognized as tenant by the landlord, without further agreement or other qualifying facts or circumstances, he becomes a tenant from year to year,
                            and is subject to the payment of the rent and other stipulations of the lease as far as the same may be applied to existent conditions. Stedman v. McIntosh, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. 291</cite>                            (1844); Scheelky v. Koch, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 80</cite>, 25 S.E. 713 (1896); Harty v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 408</cite>, 27 S.E. 90 (1897); Holton v. Andrews, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 340</cite>,
                            66 S.E. 212 (1909); Murrill v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 50</cite>, 80 S.E. 55 (1913).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The landlord may treat his tenant who holds over as a trespasser and eject him, or he may recognize him as a tenant; but when such recognition has been made, a presumption arises of a tenancy from year to year, and as stated, under the terms and stipulations
                            of the lease as far as the same may apply. Murrill v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 50</cite>, 80 S.E. 55 (1913).

                        <p>
                            A mere acceptance of rents by the landlord does not create a tenancy from year to year, nor preclude the landlord from recovery of possession. In an action to recover the possession, as the plaintiff is entitled to damages for the occupation of the premises,
                            the plaintiff can accept voluntary payments without thereby ratifying the tenant's possession. Vanderford v. Foreman, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 217</cite>, 39 S.E. 839 (1901).

                            Periodic Tenancy Created Where Rent Accepted and Tenant in Possession. - When a tenant enters into possession under an invalid lease and tenders rent which is accepted by the landlord, a periodic tenancy is created. The period of the tenancy is determined
                            by the interval between rental payments. Kent v. Humphries, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 675</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 43 (1981).

                            When Holding Over Is Allowed. - It seems that it is not a wrongful holding over when the tenant has been compelled to continue his occupation of necessity; for instance, when he has remained in possession solely by reason of the sickness of himself or
                            some member of his family, of such a character that removal could not be presently made without serious danger to the patient. Murrill v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 50</cite>, 80 S.E.
                            55 (1913).

                            Issue as to Holding Over. - The only question the court can try under subdivision (1) of this section is, "Was the defendant the tenant of the plaintiff, and does he hold over after the expiration of the tenancy?" McDonald v. Ingram,

                            Condition Must Be in Lease. - A summary proceeding in ejectment begun during the lessee's term cannot be maintained where the contract of lease contained no condition, the breach of which would authorize a reentry by the lessor. The mere failure to pay
                            rent upon "a lease at . . . . . . dollars a year, payable monthly" does not warrant such reentry. Meroney v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. 390</cite> (1879).

                        <p>
                            Breach of a condition in a lease that the lessee should not use or permit the use of any portion of the premises for any unlawful purpose or purposes, without a provision in the lease automatically terminating the lease or reserving the right of reentry
                            for breach of such condition, cannot be made the basis of summary ejectment, and a provision in the lease that should the landlord bring suit because of the breach of any covenant and prevail in such suit, the tenant should
                            pay reasonable attorneys' fees, does not constitute a provision automatically terminating the lease for breach of such condition or preserve the right of reentry. Morris v. Austraw, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 218</cite>,
                            152 S.E.2d 155 (1967).

                        <p>
                            Except in cases where G.S. 42-3 writes into a lease a forfeiture upon failure of the lessee to pay the rent within 10 days after a demand is made by the lessor or his agent for all past due rent, with right of the lessor to enter and dispossess the lessee,
                            a breach of the conditions of a lease between a landlord and tenant cannot be made the basis of summary ejectment unless the lease itself provides for termination of such breach or reserves the right of reentry for such breach.
                            Morris v. Austraw, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 218</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 155 (1967).

                            Provisions for Termination on Receivership or Bankruptcy Are Not Void. - Provisions of a lease authorizing lessors to terminate the lease and repossess the property upon the appointment of a receiver for lessee or adjudication that lessee was a bankrupt
                            were not void. Such provisions are not contrary to public policy, nor are they prohibited by statute. To the contrary, similar provisions are frequently inserted in leases, particularly when they are of long duration. Carson

                            doctrine of estoppel. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Rubish, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 275 S.E.2d 494, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 417</cite>, 293

                            Where defendant has been partially evicted, in order for him, in a summary action of ejectment, to retain possession of the leased premises by paying a reduction in the rental price fixed by his contract, he must prove that such eviction was caused by
                            the plaintiff, or one acting under his authority, or one paramount in title, and upon failure of evidence of this character, his claim therefor is properly denied as a matter of law. Blomberg v. Evans,

                            breach of such conditions cannot be made the basis for summary ejectment, and issues of fraud in procuring the lease and willful breach of the conditions are erroneously submitted in the superior court upon appeal in such action,
                            it not being permissible for a party to substitute on appeal a suit for rescission. Dees v. Apple, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 763</cite>, 178 S.E. 557 (1935).

                            Proper grounds existed for a summary ejectment proceeding, where the lease specified that if the rent was not paid within 15 days of the first of each month, the date on which the rent was due, the lessor would have the right to re-enter the premises
                            after notifying the lessee of the forfeiture of the estate, and lessee had in fact breached this condition of the lease. Chrisalis Properties, Inc. v.

                            was unaware of the guest's activity and did not condone or tolerate the activity, summary eviction would be unconscionable, as summary eviction would be shockingly unfair.

                        Implication of Language "But If He Omits to Make Such Claim." - Although this section does not explicitly state that assertion of a claim for damages and past-due rents in the summary ejectment proceeding will bar a separate action for that claim, the
                        necessary implication of the language "but if he omits to make such claim, he shall not be prejudiced thereby in any other action for their recovery" is that if the plaintiff does make such claims in the summary ejectment proceeding
                        he shall be prejudiced in another action whereby he attempts to relitigate these claims. Chrisalis Properties, Inc. v. Separate Quarters, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 81, 398 S.E.2d 628

                        Monetary Relief Limited. - In a summary ejectment proceeding, monetary relief - the recovery of rent in arrears and damages for hold-over occupancy - is limited to the amount that the magistrate is statutorily authorized to award. Chrisalis Properties,

                        All Damages Must Be Recovered in One Action. - The fact that this article specifically allows a lessor to bring an action to regain possession of the premises separate from an action for damages does not create an exception to the general rule that all
                        damages must be recovered in one action. Chrisalis Properties, Inc. v. Separate Quarters, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 81, 398 S.E.2d 628 (1990), discretionary review denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 570</cite>,

                    for the defendant to receive delivery of service from the officer. If the officer does not attempt to telephone the defendant or the attempt is unsuccessful or does not result in service to the defendant, the officer shall make at

                    a time reasonably calculated to find the defendant at the place of abode to attempt personal delivery of service. He then shall deliver a copy of the summons together with a copy of the complaint to the defendant, or leave copies thereof
                    at the defendant's dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein. If such service cannot be made the officer shall affix copies to some conspicuous part of the premises

       Notice Not Adequate for Money Damages.
      </b> - In a summary ejectment proceeding where the tenant does not make an appearance, the magistrate may not enter a money judgment for rents and other damages in addition to a order for possession where service of process was
                    effected by first class mail and posting on the premises pursuant to this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Hon. Thomas N. Hix, Chief District Court Judge, 29th Judicial Circuit, 60 N.C.A.G. 95 (1992).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because G.S. 7-217(4) states that the procedure found in this section can be used in summary ejectment cases only, and because summary ejectment is in the nature of an in rem proceeding, an in personam money damages claim cannot be heard and a money judgment
                    cannot be entered in an action where service of process is effected through the alternative method under this section. The requirements for actual service of process found elsewhere in G.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIVa19s7A-213" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-213</a></cite>                    and in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 4 would still apply to the claim for rents and other money damages.

                        Burden of Persuasion. - Dismissal of a summary ejectment action was error because a trial court held the landlord to a clear, cogent, and convincing evidence standard, and in a summary ejectment action, the landlord's burden of persuasion was by the preponderance
                        of the evidence as set forth in G.S. 42-30; this standard also applied to appeals of summary ejectment actions in the district court. Durham Hosiery Mill Ltd. P'ship v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite>                        590, 720 S.E.2d 426 (2011).

                        Monetary Relief Limited. - In a summary ejectment proceeding, monetary relief - the recovery of rent in arrears and damages for hold-over occupancy - is limited to the amount that the magistrate is statutorily authorized to award. Chrisalis Properties,

                        All Damages Must Be Recovered in One Action. - The fact that this article specifically allows a lessor to bring an action to regain possession of the premises separate from an action for damages does not create an exception to the general rule that all

                        Summary Ejectment Inappropriate. - Summary ejectment was inappropriate because a federally subsidized housing authority failed to exercise its discretion as required by federal law before pursuing a tenant's eviction; neither the federal statutory framework
                        nor the housing authority's lease or policies compelled eviction, but instead, they only delineated the grounds or cause for eviction. E. Carolina Reg'l Hous. Auth. v. Lofton, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 8</cite>,

                        Title to Land. - The question of jurisdiction is not to be determined by matter set up in the answer, but the court should hear the evidence as to the issue of tenancy, and if the same is found for the landlord, an estoppel operates upon the tenant, and

                        he restrain its execution except in a direct proceeding to set it aside for fraud, etc. Isler v. Hart, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 499</cite>, 77 S.E. 681 (1913).

                        judicata, and A could not maintain a suit for an injunction to restrain the execution of the judgment in the former action, or that he be kept in possession, or for an accounting, his remedy being to vacate the judgment for recognized
                        equitable reasons in direct proceedings. Isler v. Hart, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 499</cite>, 77 S.E. 681 (1913).

                    On appeal to the district court, the jury trying issues joined shall assess the damages of the plaintiff for the detention of his possession to the time of the trial in that court; and, if the jury finds that the detention was wrongful and that the appeal
                    was without merit and taken for the purpose of delay, the plaintiff, in addition to any other damages allowed, shall be entitled to the amount of rent in arrears, or which may have accrued, to the time of trial in the district court.
                    Judgment for the rent in arrears and for the damages assessed may, on motion, be rendered against the sureties to the appeal.

                        This section was passed in the interest of the tenant. A landlord could bring an action after demand as required by the statute, when each installment of rent was due. The tenant had to pay the rent and costs before judgment or get out. This section was
                        to protect the tenant from hasty eviction, while at the same time the landlord would obtain his rent and costs. Ryan v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 563</cite>, 130 S.E. 156 (1925).

                        This section applies to actions to recover possession of demised premises "upon a forfeiture for the nonpayment of rent" and not to actions to recover possession of property for one of the causes enumerated in G.S. 42-26. Seligson v. Klyman,

                        G.S. 42-3 and this section are remedial in nature and will apply only where the parties' lease does not cover the issue of forfeiture of the lease term upon nonpayment of rent. Where the contracting parties have considered the issue, negotiated a response,
                        and memorialized their response within the lease, the trial court appropriately should decline to apply these statutory provisions. Charlotte Office Tower Assocs. v.

                        What Must Be Paid. - Under the provisions of this section the lessee in summary ejectment is given the right to tender or pay into court the amount of rent due under the lease to the time of the beginning of the action, with interest and costs, and upon
                        his so doing, the proceedings will be stayed; and thus the exception of a lessor that all rents, whether due under the terms of the contract or not, should be included to the time of the dismissal of the action, was untenable.

                        Where a contract for the lease of land at a specified rent contains a provision giving to the lessee the right to take sand therefrom at a stated price, the lessor in ejectment cannot maintain the position that the lessee should tender or pay for the
                        sand he may thus have used, under the provision of this section, as a part of the rental due by him, the contract being construed separately as to the two provisions. Ryan v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 563</cite>,

                        denied, and the term not having expired, the tender of rent in arrears before judgment would bar the cause. Hoover v. Crotts, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 617</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 705 (1950).

                        incurred, as provided in this section, it was held that the petition was properly denied. Coleman v. Carolina Theatres, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 607</cite>, 143 S.E. 7 (1928).

                        Where lease provides that landlord shall have the option to declare the lease void upon failure of lessee to pay rent when due, and waives notice to vacate, lessee may not prevent forfeiture by tendering rents due upon the trial. Tucker v. Arrowood,

                        Effect of Acceptance of Rent. - Acceptance by the landlord of rent accruing after termination of lease, after suit for possession, does not create a tenancy from year to year, and does not preclude the landlord from recovery. Vanderford v. Forman,

                        party disputes the amount of the payment or the due date in the undertaking, the aggrieved party may move for modification of the terms of the undertaking before the clerk of superior court or the district court. Upon such motion
                        and upon notice to all interested parties, the clerk or court shall hold a hearing within 10 calendar days of the date the motion is filed and determine what modifications, if any, are appropriate. No writ of possession or other
                        execution of the magistrate's judgment shall take place during the time the aggrieved party's motion for modification is pending before the clerk of court.

                    <p>
                        Burden of Persuasion. - Dismissal of a summary ejectment action was error because a trial court held the landlord to a clear, cogent, and convincing evidence standard, and in a summary ejectment action, the landlord's burden of persuasion was by the preponderance
                        of the evidence as set forth in G.S. 42-30; this standard also applied to appeals of summary ejectment actions in the district court. Durham Hosiery Mill Ltd. P'ship v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite>                        590, 720 S.E.2d 426 (2011).

                        Plaintiff was not required to comply with this section in order to perfect her appeal, because this section only provides the mechanism for an appellant to stay execution of the magistrate's judgment pending the appeal. Fairchild Properties v. Hall,

                        Discretion as to Surety. - On an application to a justice of the peace (now magistrate) for a suspension of execution after a recovery by a landlord against his tenant, the justice (now magistrate) has discretion as to the sufficiency of the surety, the
                        exercise of which a judge will not review in the absence of any suggestion that the justice (now magistrate) acted dishonestly or capriciously. Steadman v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 388</cite>                        (1871).

                    <p>
                        Power to Increase Bond. - If the bonds should become impaired or if the litigation should become protracted to such an extent as to require additional security to protect the plaintiffs in their rents, then under this section the superior (now district)
                        court can require additional security. Featherstone v. Carr, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 800</cite>, 44 S.E. 592 (1903).

                    <p>
                        Not only is it within the jurisdiction and power of the superior (now district) courts to have the bonds increased or strengthened, but under their general powers in equity they would have the right to take such action. Featherstone v. Carr,

                        Judgment Prior to Action on Bond. - A bond with sureties, conditioned upon the payment of any judgment given in summary proceedings in ejectment, makes the obtaining of the judgment a condition precedent to a recovery thereon against the sureties; and
                        the obtaining of such a judgment must be shown by proper averment and proof, or an action against the sureties will be premature. Blackmore v. Winders, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 212</cite>, 56 S.E.

                        and the lessor was deprived of the use of its money while it was retained by the clerk. N.C. Indus. Capital, LLC v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 649 S.E.2d 14 (2007).

                        under the statute, and thus the lease terms regarding late fees were no longer applicable. N.C. Indus. Capital, LLC v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 649 S.E.2d 14 (2007).

                        When Tenant Restored to Possession. - When a party is put out of possession of land, or is compelled to pay money, under a judgment which is afterwards reserved or set aside, the court will restore the party to the possession of the land, and give him
                        a remedy for the money thus paid. Lytle v. Lytle, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 522</cite> (1886).

                        Eviction of Tenant in Federally Subsidized Low-Income Housing Project. - A tenant in a federally subsidized low-income housing project has an "entitlement" to continued occupancy and cannot be evicted until certain procedural protections have been afforded
                        him. Where a tenant, upon eviction, was not afforded Housing and Urban Development eviction procedures, tenant's tenancy continued as a month-to-month tenancy without interruption. Pursuant to this section, the damages of the tenant
                        which proximately flowed from her wrongful eviction were the loss of her security deposit, her moving expenses, the cost of transfer and storage of her furniture, and the loss of her entitlement to federal rental subsidy payments

                        Sheriff May Store Property. - When the sheriff removes the personal property of an evicted tenant from demised premises pursuant to a writ or order the tenant shall take possession of his property. If the tenant fails or refuses to take possession of
                        his property, the sheriff may deliver the property to any storage warehouse in the county, or in an adjoining county if no storage warehouse is located in that county, for storage. The sheriff may require the landlord to advance
                        the cost of delivering the property to a storage warehouse plus the cost of one month's storage before delivering the property to a storage warehouse. If a landlord refuses to advance these costs when requested to do so by the
                        sheriff, the sheriff shall not remove the tenant's property, but shall return the writ unexecuted to the issuing clerk of court with a notation thereon of his reason for not executing the writ. Except for the disposition of manufactured
                        homes and their contents as provided in G.S. 42-25.9(g) and G.S. 44A-2(e2), within seven days of the landlord's being placed in lawful possession by execution of a writ of possession and upon the tenant's request within that seven-day
                        period, the landlord shall release possession of the property to the tenant during regular business hours or at a time agreed upon. During the seven-day period after being placed in lawful possession by execution of a writ of possession,
                        a landlord may move for storage purposes, but shall not throw away, dispose of, or sell any items of personal property remaining on the premises unless otherwise provided for in this Chapter. If, after being placed in lawful possession
                        by execution of a writ, the landlord has offered to release the tenant's property and the tenant fails to retrieve such property during the landlord's regular business hours within seven days after execution of the writ, the landlord
                        may throw away, dispose of, or sell the property in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 42-25.9(g). If the tenant does not request release of the property within seven days, all costs of summary ejectment, execution and storage
                        proceedings shall be charged to the tenant as court costs and shall constitute a lien against the stored property or a claim against any remaining balance of the proceeds of a warehouseman's lien sale.

                        This Article provides protection to those persons occupying "a dwelling unit . . . normally held out for the use of residential tenants who are using the dwelling as their primary residence."

                        Residents of Hotel. - Where each plaintiff resided in hotel pursuant to an oral lease and leased his apartment as his sole and permanent residence, some plaintiffs had resided in the building for as long as six years, and the payments for the apartments
                        were made weekly and were referred to by each party as "rent," at a minimum, the evidence presented genuine issues of material fact regarding plaintiffs' status as residential tenants, and for this reason, summary judgment was
                        improperly granted. Baker v. Rushing, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 240, 409 S.E.2d 108 (1991).

                        This section did not apply to an action involving personal injuries suffered by tenants when the deck of a rented beach cottage collapsed, as the house was not the tenants' primary residence. Conley v. Emerald Isle Realty, Inc.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 293</cite>, 513 S.E.2d 556 (1999).

                        Liability of Agent. - The broad, statutory definition of landlord makes irrelevant in determining the liability of an agent the common law distinction between disclosed and undisclosed principals. Thus a "person having the actual or apparent authority
                        of an agent to perform the duties imposed" by this Article, would be subject to individual liability for plaintiffs' claim for breach of the implied warranty of habitability. Baker v. Rushing, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite>                        240, 409 S.E.2d 108 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Whether agent who supervised the on-site manager of the building, gave him instructions on the daily operation of the premises, and had authority to order repairs and to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition was "a person with the
                        actual or apparent authority of an agent to perform the duties imposed" by this Article was a genuine issue of material fact. This evidence could support a finding that agent was a landlord as defined by this Article. Baker v.
                        Rushing, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 240, 409 S.E.2d 108 (1991).

                    <p>
                        As agent/manager of property defendant had actual authority to repair and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition and had failed to do so during plaintiff's tenancy; therefore, as landlord, defendant's violation of G.S. 42-42 subjected him
                        to liability for rent abatement. Surratt v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 396, 393 S.E.2d 554 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Plaintiff had a claim for rent abatement against landlord for the amount of rent paid, and no lesser measure of damages was recoverable against landlord merely because he was not the owner but was an agent. Surratt v. Newton,
                        <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 396, 393 S.E.2d 554 (1990).

                        Rent Abatement Allowed for Unfit Apartment. - A tenant is liable only for the reasonable value, if any, of his use of the property in its defective condition while he remains in possession. Accordingly, a tenant may recover damages in the form of a rent
                        abatement calculated as the difference between the fair rental value of the premises if as warranted (i.e., in full compliance with G.S. 42-42(a)) and the fair rental value of the premises in their unfit condition, for any period
                        of the tenant's occupancy during which the finder of fact determines the premises were uninhabitable, plus any special or consequential damages alleged and proved. Miller v. C.W. Myers Trading Post, Inc.,

                        Where the landlord breached the implied warranty of habitability under G.S. 42-42(a)(2), (3), the tenant was entitled to rent abatement under G.S. 42-41, and the trial court was to calculate the damages suffered by the tenant. Dean v. Hill,

                        Punitive Damages Recoverable Only Where Conduct Is Tortious. - Punitive damages are not recoverable in an action for a contractual remedy based on breach of an implied warranty of habitability when the breach neither constitutes nor is accompanied by
                        tortious conduct. Miller v. C.W. Myers Trading Post, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 355 S.E.2d 189 (1987).

                        Nature of Landlord's Duty. - The duty owed by a landlord is not the duty to warn of unsafe conditions, but rather the duty to correct unsafe conditions. Allen v. Equity &amp; Investors Mgt. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite>                        706, 289 S.E.2d 623 (1982).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subdivision (a)(2) of this section imposes not a duty to warn, but a duty to correct unfit conditions. Brooks v. Francis, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 556, 291 S.E.2d 889 (1982).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Grant of summary judgment in favor of the landlord was proper pursuant to G.S. 42-42(a)(4) because, where a landlord lacked knowledge of a hazardous condition created on his leased premises by his tenant, he could not have been held liable for harm caused
                        to third parties by that condition. There was no evidence of defective conditions existed at the time the apartment was leased and the landlord had no knowledge of the planter area being potentially hazardous due to the tenant's
                        alternations of it. Martin v. Kilauea Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 715 S.E.2d 210 (2011).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section did not supplant the landlords' common law duty to warn tenants of hazardous conditions of which landlords know or should know; therefore, the trial court erred when it dismissed plaintiff's claim against defendant-landlords where, prior
                        to the house fire which killed one child and injured another, defendant-landlords never warned the tenants of the potential fire hazard and where they also failed to advise the tenants to vacate the premises because of the hazardous
                        conditions. Prince v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 262, 541 S.E.2d 191 (2000).

                        Subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(3) contemplate the repair or maintenance function and have no relevance to the construction and design of rented dwellings. Collingwood v. General Elec. Real Estate Equities, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                        656, 366 S.E.2d 901 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 63</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 425 (1989).

                    <p>
                        North Carolina cases construing subdivision (a)(3) have applied it in context of safety maintenance of common areas. Collingwood v. General Elec. Real Estate Equities, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 656, 366 S.E.2d
                        901 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 63</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 425 (1989).

                    <p>
                        Where the conditions enumerated in subdivision (a)(4) of this section are the same conditions which render the premises unfit and uninhabitable no written notice is required under the statute. Surratt v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite>                        396, 393 S.E.2d 554 (1990).

                    <p>
                        While subdivision (a)(4) of this section does require written notification of needed repairs involving electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and other facilities and appliances supplied or required to be supplied by the
                        landlord, the statute does not require written notification of these needed repairs if the repairs are necessary to put the premises in a fit and habitable condition or if the conditions constitute an emergency. Surratt v. Newton,
                        <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 396, 393 S.E.2d 554 (1990).

                    <p>
                        No Waiver of Right to Recover for Defect by Taking Possession. - The trial court's suggestion that defendant had waived any right to recover for the defect by taking possession of the premises with the knowledge of the heater's defect and repairs constituted
                        an incorrect statement of the law under this section. Mendenhall-Moore Realtors v. Sedoris, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 486, 366 S.E.2d 534 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Defendant's subsequent acceptance of the premises while hot water heater had not been repaired did not waive defendant's rights to recover for the defect. Mendenhall-Moore Realtors v. Sedoris, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                        486, 366 S.E.2d 534 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Tenant is entitled to decline taking possession of leased premises where a landlord fails to provide and maintain any services agreed upon at the time the lease was contracted. Mendenhall-Moore Realtors v. Sedoris, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                        486, 366 S.E.2d 534 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(4) mean that when landlord has either expressed or implicitly agreed to provide service to or an appliance in demised property, same must be supplied or repaired in time for the tenant to take possession. In other words, this
                        section entitles a tenant to the value of the bargain contained in the lease which includes full and adequate operation of services promised by the landlord. Mendenhall-Moore Realtors v. Sedoris, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                        486, 366 S.E.2d 534 (1988).

                        Hot Water Not Required in Residential Premises. - The statute does not per se require the furnishing of hot water in residential premises. Mendenhall-Moore Realtors v. Sedoris, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 486, 366
                        S.E.2d 534 (1988).

                        A landlord has a duty to exercise due care in making repairs to leased premises. Bolkhir v. North Carolina State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 706</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 898 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Rental of premises for price that is "fair" or below fair rental value does not absolve the landlord of his statutory obligation to provide fit premises. The implied warranty of habitability entitles a tenant in possession of leased premises to the value
                        of the premises as warranted, which may be greater than the rent agreed upon or paid. Miller v. C.W. Myers Trading Post, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 355 S.E.2d 189 (1987).

                    <p>
                        "Switching" of Screen and Glass Panels in Door of Apartment. - In action brought by plaintiff as guardian ad litem for his injured son for injuries suffered when he pushed through a glass panel installed by defendant's employee on storm door of an apartment
                        rented by plaintiff, the Industrial Commission could find and conclude that the replacement of the screen panel with glass by defendant's employee was not reasonably prudent conduct under the circumstances presented, as defendant's
                        employee had actual knowledge that plaintiff's children habitually opened the door in question by pushing forcefully on the middle panel, and the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the Commission's resolution of the question.
                        Bolkhir v. North Carolina State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 706</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 898 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Violation as Evidence of Negligence. - A residential landlord in North Carolina owes his tenant a statutory duty of exercising ordinary or reasonable care to maintain common areas of the leased premises in a safe condition, and a violation of that duty
                        is evidence of negligence. O'Neal v. Kellett, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 225, 284 S.E.2d 707 (1981).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the duty to keep the common areas in a safe condition implies the duty to make reasonable inspection and to correct an unsafe condition which a reasonable inspection might reveal, such a breach of duty would constitute actionable negligence on defendants'
                        part and would support a verdict for plaintiff. Lenz v. Ridgewood Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 284 S.E.2d 702 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 300</cite>, 290

                        Standard of Care Was Not Mere Compliance with Subdivision (a)(1). - Where complaint alleged that defendants were negligent in design and construction of apartment, where defendant argued standard of care was compliance with state and local building and
                        housing codes, and where defendant pointed out that apartment's plans, specifications, materials, and construction conformed in all respects to subdivision (a)(1), compliance with statutory standard was only evidence of due care,
                        and compliance with this section did not insulate landlords from liability for defects in building design or construction. Collingwood v. General Elec. Real Estate Equities, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 63</cite>,

                        As agent/manager of property defendant had actual authority to repair and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition and had failed to do so during plaintiff's tenancy; therefore, as landlord, defendant's violation of this section subjected him

                        Breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability. - Court's conclusion that the amount of rent owed by defendant abated in compensation for plaintiff's violations of housing code, pursuant to this section, mandated a further conclusion that plaintiff violated

                        The proper measure of damages in a rent abatement action based on a breach of the implied warranty of habitability is the difference between the fair rental value of the property in a warranted condition and the fair rental value of the property in its
                        unwarranted condition, provided, however, the damages do not exceed the total amount of rent paid by the tenant; and the tenant is entitled to any special and consequential damages alleged and proved. Von Pettis Realty, Inc. v.

                        Tenant's Contributory Negligence Held a Jury Question. - In a civil action wherein a tenant was injured when he stepped into a hole under the landlord's control, it could not be said as a matter of law whether the surrounding circumstances - darkness,
                        a growth of grass around the hole, the lapse of time between the tenant's prior awareness of the hole and his injury - were sufficient to excuse the tenant's alleged contributory negligence, and the issue of contributory negligence
                        should have been decided by the jury. Baker v. Duhan, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 191, 330 S.E.2d 53 (1985).

                        Rent Abatement Allowed for Unfit Apartment. - A tenant is liable only for the reasonable value, if any, of his use of the property in its defective condition while he remains in possession. Accordingly, a tenant may recover damages in the form of a rent
                        abatement calculated as the difference between the fair rental value of the premises if as warranted (i.e., in full compliance with subsection (a)) and the fair rental value of the premises in their unfit condition, for any period
                        of the tenant's occupancy during which the finder of fact determines the premises were uninhabitable, plus any special or consequential damages alleged and proved. Miller v. C.W. Myers Trading Post, Inc.,

                        Tenants may bring an action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, seeking rent abatement, based on their landlord's noncompliance with subsection (a). The rent abatement is calculated as the difference between the fair rental value of the
                        premises if as warranted (i.e., in full compliance with subsection (a)) and the fair rental value of the premises in their unfit condition ("as is") plus any special and consequential damages alleged and proved. Cotton v. Stanley,

                        Efforts to Repair Did Not Preclude Rent Abatement. - Where plaintiff violated this section, the trial court could not deny rent abatements for two months because of plaintiff's reasonable efforts to repair during those months. Creekside Apts. v. Poteat,

                        Determination of Fair Rental Value of Premises in Calculating Rent Abatement. - The fair rental value of property may be determined by proof of what the premises would rent for in the open market, or by evidence of other facts from which the fair rental
                        value of the premises may be determined; the "other facts" include the dilapidated condition of the premises - indirect evidence of fair rental value. Cotton v.

                    <p>
                        Direct evidence of fair rental value is an opinion of what the premises would rent for on the open market from either an expert or a witness qualified by familiarity with the specific piece of property. Cotton v. Stanley,

                    <p>
                        The rent agreed upon by the parties when entering into the lease is some evidence of the property's "as warranted" fair rental value, but it is not binding. Cotton v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 534, 358
                        S.E.2d 692, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 296</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 779 (1987).

                    <p>
                        The illegality of re-renting a unit on the open market does not automatically reduce the unit's fair rental value to zero. The measure of the unit's fair rental value is not the price at which the owner could lawfully rent the unit to a new tenant in
                        the open market, but the price at which he could rent it if it were lawful for him to do so; thus, the trial court did not err by refusing to find the fair rental value of the plaintiffs' units was zero during the period of time
                        between the repair deadline and the date of repair. Cotton v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 534, 358 S.E.2d 692, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 296</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 779

                        Three-Year Statute of Limitations Governs Rent Abatement. - Rent abatement sought by plaintiffs under the Residential Rental Agreements Act, G.S. 42-38 et seq., a remedy which is not spelled out but which is implied from the statute, and which is not
                        punitive but rather in the nature of a restitutionary remedy, was governed by three-year statute of limitations pursuant to G.S. 1-52(1) and (2). Miller v. C.W. Myers Trading Post, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite>                        362, 355 S.E.2d 189 (1987).

                        Rent Abatement Erroneously Allowed. - Trial court erred, inter alia, in finding that a landlord violated the Residential Rental Agreements Act and in granting a tenant's claim for rent abatement because not only did the trial court fail to make findings
                        as to whether the landlord knew or had reason to know the alarm provided by a broker was not new or in good or safe working order, but it also made no findings as to how failing to verify the operability of the smoke alarm and
                        a carbon monoxide alarm rendered the premises unfit for human habitation, or how such unfitness devalued the fair rental value of the property such that the tenant was entitled to rent abatement. Stikeleather Realty &amp; Invs.

                        Nothing in the Residential Rental Agreement Act precludes a tenant from recovering damages for breach of the covenant of habitability where she has withheld rent; however, damages for rent abatement can only include those amounts actually paid by defendant
                        for substandard housing. Allen v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 394 S.E.2d 478 (1990).

                        Plaintiff had a claim for rent abatement against landlord for amount of rent paid, and no lesser measure of damages was recoverable against landlord merely because he was not the owner but was an agent. Surratt v. Newton,

                        Jury's award of $6,400.00 fell within the permissible range of damages in a rent abatement case, and the trial court therefore correctly denied plaintiff's motion for a new trial on the issue of damages. Von Pettis Realty, Inc. v. McKoy,

                        Consequential or Special Damages. - Damages for rent abatement are limited to the amount of rent actually paid by the tenant for the substandard housing, plus any additional special or consequential damages alleged and proved. Foy v. Spinks,

                        Punitive Damages Recoverable Only Where Conduct Is Tortious. - Punitive damages are not recoverable in an action for a contractual remedy based on breach of an implied warranty of habitability when the breach neither constitutes nor is accompanied by
                        tortious conduct. Miller v. C.W. Myers Trading Post, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 355 S.E.2d 189 (1987).

                        Violations of subsection (a) constitute a continuing offense. Thus, plaintiffs would be entitled to recover for any period of their occupancy (following the three-year limit of the statute of limitations) during which they could establish that the condition
                        of the premises was substandard as measured by the statute, regardless of whether the conditions complained of first existed prior to that time. Miller v. C.W.

                        Violation of Housing Code. - Where tenant found many of the conditions in her residence were in violation of the housing code at the time she moved in the house and that landlord's attempts at correcting those conditions were either unsuccessful or temporary,
                        on these facts there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury on whether the house was uninhabitable during the period in which tenant did in fact pay rent. Allen v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite>                        636, 394 S.E.2d 478 (1990).

                        The evidence that premises rented to tenant never met city code standard was sufficient to allow the jury to decide whether tenant was entitled to rent abatement. Allen v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 636,

                        Damage to Tenant's Personal Property. - Trial court did not err when it awarded damages for a broken windshield where a tenant informed the landlord that a tree in the yard of a rented home was rotten and that it posed a danger to her and her family;
                        thereafter, the landlord took no action to remove the defective tree from the property, and during a storm, a limb broke off the tree and damaged the windshield of the tenant's car. Pierce v. Reichard,

                        Rent Abatement Allowed for Unfit Apartment. - A tenant is liable only for the reasonable value, if any, of his use of the property in its defective condition while he remains in possession. Accordingly, a tenant may recover damages in the form of a rent
                        abatement calculated as the difference between the fair rental value of the premises if as warranted (i.e., in full compliance with subsection (a)) and the fair rental value of the premises in their unfit condition, for any period
                        of the tenant's occupancy during which the finder of fact determines the premises were uninhabitable, plus any special or consequential damages alleged and proved. Miller v. C.W. Myers Trading Post, Inc.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 355 S.E.2d 189 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Damages for Rent Abatement. - Nothing in the Residential Rental Agreement Act precludes a tenant from recovering damages for breach of the covenant of habitability where she has withheld rent; however, damages for rent abatement can only include those
                        amounts actually paid by defendant for substandard housing. Allen v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 394 S.E.2d 478 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Three-Year Statute of Limitations Governs Rent Abatement. - Rent abatement sought by plaintiffs under the Residential Rental Agreements Act, G.S. 42-38 et seq., a remedy which is not spelled out but which is implied from the statute, and which is not
                        punitive but rather in the nature of a restitutionary remedy, was governed by three-year statute of limitations pursuant to G.S. 1-52(1) and (2). Miller v. C.W. Myers Trading Post, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite>                        362, 355 S.E.2d 189 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Punitive Damages Recoverable Only Where Conduct Is Tortious. - Punitive damages are not recoverable in an action for a contractual remedy based on breach of an implied warranty of habitability when the breach neither constitutes nor is accompanied by
                        tortious conduct. Miller v. C.W. Myers Trading Post, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 355 S.E.2d 189 (1987).

                        Directed Verdict Properly Entered on Issue of Fraud. - Where, prior to tenant's agreement to rent a house landlord's agent represented that he would make the needed repairs, and where the evidence showed that landlord agent did in fact make the repairs
                        albeit not to the satisfaction of defendant, the court found no evidence that at the time of his promise landlord intended not to make the repairs he was promising to make, and properly entered directed verdict on the issue of
                        fraud. Allen v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 394 S.E.2d 478 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Housing Code Violations. - Where tenant found many of the conditions in her residence were in violation of the housing code at the time she moved in the house and that landlord's attempts at correcting those conditions were either unsuccessful or temporary,
                        on these facts there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury on whether the house was uninhabitable during the period in which tenant did in fact pay rent. Allen v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite>                        636, 394 S.E.2d 478 (1990).

                    <p>
                        The evidence that premises rented to tenant never met city code standard was sufficient to allow the jury to decide whether tenant was entitled to rent abatement. Allen v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 636,

                        Rent Money Paid by Tenants Under a Lease Belonged to the Owners. - Rent money paid by tenants under a lease belonged to the owners of the leased property; lawyers who agreed to receive the rent payment on behalf of their clients, the owners, were obligated
                        to disburse the owners' funds to them on request and to not disclose the disbursement to the tenants. Thus, the tenants' suit against the lawyers, alleging a breach of a fiduciary obligation based on the disbursement of the rent
                        money to the owners, was properly dismissed. Noblot v. Timmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 628 S.E.2d 413 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Administration Fees. - When a residential lease provided for an administrative fee to be charged to a tenant if legal papers were filed against the tenant, this was not a late fee governed by G.S. 42-46(a), as it was reasonably related to the additional
                        expense incurred by the landlord and did not relate solely to the rent being late. Friday v. United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 671, 575 S.E.2d 532 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Excessive Late Fees. - Residential lease providing for a late fee greater than five percent of the rental obligation violated G.S. 42-46(a), even though the late fees that the tenant was actually charged did not violate the statute; the late fee provision
                        was void and unenforceable as against public policy. Friday v. United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 671, 575 S.E.2d 532 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Residential lease provision stating a late fee exceeding five percent of the rent payment, which, therefor, violated the statutory limitation on late fees in G.S. 42-46(a), could support a finding that the landlord violated G.S. 75-54(4) by falsely representing
                        the amount of a debt against the tenant when the landlord requested that late fee in three summary ejectment complaints, or "legal proceedings," against the tenant. Friday v. United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.,

                        Residential lease provision stating a late fee exceeding five percent of the rent payment, which, therefore, violated the statutory limitation on late fees in G.S. 42-46(a), could support a finding that the landlord violated G.S. 75-55(2) by collecting
                        or attempting to collect a charge incidental to the principal debt to which the landlord was not legally entitled. Friday v. United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite>                        671, 575 S.E.2d 532 (2003).

                    where the tenant's deposit is currently located or the name of the insurance company providing the bond.

                        was properly denied because the tenants were not entitled to automatic full refunds of security deposits but only a refund of any sums withheld for a use not statutorily permitted, requiring individual trials and making a class

                    The General Assembly recognizes that the residents of this State have the right to the peaceful, safe, and quiet enjoyment of their homes. The General Assembly further recognizes that these rights, as well as the health, safety, and welfare of residents,
                    are often jeopardized by the criminal activity of other residents of rented residential property, but that landlords are often unable to remove those residents engaged in criminal activity. In order to ensure that residents of this
                    State can have the peaceful, safe, and quiet enjoyment of their homes, the provisions of this Article are deemed to apply to all residential rental agreements in this State.

                        Section Does Not Mandate Eviction or Impose Liability for Failing to Evict. - Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment for landlords in a tenant's action to recover damages for personal injuries he sustained when another tenant assaulted him
                        because the landlords could not be held liable for their allegedly negligent leasing of property to the other tenant; G.S. 42-59.1, and the article in which it is contained, provides landlords with the power to evict tenants engaged
                        in certain criminal activity, but neither mandates eviction nor imposes liability on a landlord for failing to evict. Davenport v. D.M. Rental Props., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 718
