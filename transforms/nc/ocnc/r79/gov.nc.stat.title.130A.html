      "(b) In order for measurable benefits to be realized through the implementation of the Plan, the Plan shall include the adoption of levels of performance necessary to promote:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Uniformity across local health departments,
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Best evidence-based services,
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) National standards of performance,
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Innovations in public health practice, and
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Reduction of geographic and racial health disparities.
     </p>
     <p>
      "LHDs shall have the flexibility and opportunity to use the resources available to achieve the required performance measures in a manner that best suits the LHD.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(c) The Plan will address the need to provide county health departments with financial incentives to encourage and increase local investment in public health functions. County governments shall not supplant existing local funding with State incentive resources. The Secretary may revise the list of activities and performance measures as appropriate, but before doing so, the Secretary shall provide a written explanation of the rationale for the addition, deletion, or revision.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(d) In developing the Plan the Secretary shall establish and chair the Public Health Improvement Plan Task Force (Task Force), the members and expertise of which shall include:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Local health departments,
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Department staff,
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Individuals and entities with expertise in the development of performance measures, accountability, and systems management,
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Experts in development of evidence-based medical guidelines or public health practice guidelines, and
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Individuals and entities that will be affected by the performance measures.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(e) The implementation schedule for the Plan shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) July 1, 2009, establish the Task Force to develop the Plan,
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) March 31, 2010, submit the Plan to the 2010 Regular Session of the 2009 General Assembly,
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) July 1, 2010, implement the Plan, and
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) November 15, 2011, and annually thereafter, report on Plan implementation.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(f) The Department will identify the programmatic activities and funding in the Division of Public Health associated with the core functions and activities in the Plan. Funds associated with these activities shall be subject to a flexible spending formula adopted by the Department, as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Beginning in SFY 2010-2011, the flexible spending formula will begin to replace the current spending with a more effective method of funding public health activities at the local level and achieving the results expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The Task Force shall identify a reliable and consistent source of State revenue to fund the flexible spending formula.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) If sufficient additional revenue is available to implement the Plan, a separate set-aside of available funds would be created. This set-aside would be available to contiguous LHDs that seek to address a specific women's health, child health, or adult health disease or chronic condition, and in doing so, choose to merge into a single Local Health District, thus saving administrative dollars to be focused on public health issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(g) Funds appropriated to the Department for flexible spending shall be distributed to county health departments as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Each of the county health departments will receive a base amount to be determined by the DHHS.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The balance of funds in the Flexible Spending Account is to be distributed to the counties on the basis of a formula that takes into consideration the following elements:
     </p>
     <p>
      "a. Population,
     </p>
     <p>
      "b. Per capita income,

     </p>
     <p>
      "7. Stroke.
     </p>
     <p>
      "d. Percent of minorities in the county,
     </p>
     <p>
      "e. Body Mass Index (BMI) of public school students, and
     </p>
     <p>
      "f. Other factors as the Secretary may find necessary to achieve the goals of the Plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The use of the funds by the LHD would reflect the core public health functions. It will be incumbent upon the LHD to use the funds in a manner that assures its achievement of the performance measures adopted by the Secretary.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(h) To ensure compliance with Department directives, the Task Force shall consider requiring each county health department to submit to the Secretary such data as the Secretary determines is necessary to allow the Secretary to assess whether the county health department has used the funds in a manner consistent with achieving the performance measures associated with this Plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(i) Beginning November 15, 2011, and biannually thereafter, the Secretary shall report to the Governor and the General Assembly on:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The distribution of funds to LHDs,
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The use of these funds by LHDs,
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The specific effect the funding from this Plan has had on:
     </p>
     <p>
      "a. LHDs' performance,
     </p>
     <p>
      "b. Health status indicators, and
     </p>
     <p>
      "c. Health disparities.

       Subject Matter Jurisdiction.
   
   - Trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction to enter findings or conclusions regarding an animal rights organization's claim against a private agency for alleged violations by the agency of G.S. 130A-192, as enforcement of the statute was proper against the local board of health in the Office of Administrative Hearings under G.S. 130A-4(a) and G.S. 130A-24. Justice for Animals, Inc. v. Lenoir County SPCA, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 607 S.E.2d 317 (2005).

      <p>
       Letter to an employee after her termination while on medical leave that expressed sympathy for her medical condition and reiterated facts regarding the employee's termination did not constitute sufficient notice of the decision or action regarding the grievance filed by the employee, which triggered the right to appeal for purposes of G.S. 126-38 (now repealed); because the employer, the Department of Social Services (DSS), failed to provide the notice required under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba03s150B-23ol1f" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-23(f)</a></cite> as to appealing her termination, an administrative law judge properly denied the DSS' motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely.

      - Session Laws 2014-17, s. 1, as amended by Session Laws 2014-44, s. 1(a), provides: "The General Assembly finds that prior to the United States Supreme Court ruling in
      <i>
       CTS Corp. v. Waldburger
      </i>
      , that there was ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the effect of federal law on the North Carolina statute of repose in certain environmental cases. The General Assembly finds that it was the intent of the General Assembly to maximize under federal law the amount of time a claimant had to bring a claim predicated on exposure to a contaminant regulated by federal or State law. The General Assembly finds that the Supreme Court's decision is inconsistent with the General Assembly's intentions and the General Assembly's understanding of federal law at the time that certain actions were filed. The General Assembly finds that it never intended the statute of repose in G.S. 1-52(16) to apply to claims for latent disease caused or contributed to by groundwater contamination, or to claims for any latent harm caused or contributed to by groundwater contamination."

     </p>
     <p>
      "(c) The Plan will address the need to provide county health departments with financial incentives to encourage and increase local investment in public health functions. County governments shall not supplant existing local funding with State incentive resources. The Secretary may revise the list of activities and performance measures as appropriate, but before doing so, the Secretary shall provide a written explanation of the rationale for the addition, deletion, or revision.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(d) In developing the Plan the Secretary shall establish and chair the Public Health Improvement Plan Task Force (Task Force), the members and expertise of which shall include:

     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) If sufficient additional revenue is available to implement the Plan, a separate set-aside of available funds would be created. This set-aside would be available to contiguous LHDs that seek to address a specific women's health, child health, or adult health disease or chronic condition, and in doing so, choose to merge into a single Local Health District, thus saving administrative dollars to be focused on public health issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(g) Funds appropriated to the Department for flexible spending shall be distributed to county health departments as follows:
     </p>
     <p>

     <p>
      "f. Other factors as the Secretary may find necessary to achieve the goals of the Plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The use of the funds by the LHD would reflect the core public health functions. It will be incumbent upon the LHD to use the funds in a manner that assures its achievement of the performance measures adopted by the Secretary.

       Preemption.
   
   - North Carolina General Assembly's statement of intent evidences an intent to provide a complete regulatory scheme, thus preempting local government from regulating wastewater systems designed to discharge effluent to the land surface. Therefore, a county health department did not have the authority to inspect spray irrigation systems since only the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources had the authority to do so. Phillips v. Orange County Health Dep't, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 765 S.E.2d 811 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Rule-Making Powers.
   
   - A board of health acts within its rule-making powers when it enacts a regulation which (1) is related to the promotion or protection of health, (2) is reasonable in light of the health risk addressed, (3) is not violative of any law or constitutional provision, (4) is not discriminatory, and (5) does not make distinctions based upon policy concerns traditionally reserved for legislative bodies. City of Roanoke Rapids v. Peedin, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 578, 478 S.E.2d 528 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the county board of health could adopt rules more strict than those adopted at the state level to protect the public health, under G.S. 130A-39(b), its rules attempting to regulate swine farms more strictly than the State could not stand because they insufficiently expressed a rationale for the county's stricter regulation.

      <p>
       Limited Powers.
   
   - County boards of health and other administrative agencies, being creatures of statute, have only such powers as are conferred upon them by statute, either expressly or by necessary implication. Champion v. Vance County Bd. of Health, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 96</cite>, 19 S.E.2d 239 (1942), decided under former statutory provisions.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Powers Exceeded.
   
   - Enactment of county smoking rules exceeded the general limitations imposed upon rule-making powers of boards of health. City of Roanoke Rapids v. Peedin, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 578, 478 S.E.2d 528 (1996).

       Findings of Board Not Final.
   
   - The finding of the county board of health that the maintenance of a cemetery upon the watershed is a nuisance to the public health has not the same force as the positive declarations of statute, and it may be shown in answer to a notice to show cause why an injunction should not be continued to the final hearing that the particular cemetery, as maintained, was not a nuisance entitling the plaintiff to injunctive relief.

The public health authority may pay for or contribute its share of the cost of any such contract or arrangement from revenues available for these purposes, including revenues arising from the provision of public health services.

       An authority may contract to insure itself and any of its board members, agents, or employees against liability for wrongful death or negligent or intentional damage to person or property or against absolute liability for damage to person or property caused by an act or omission of the authority or of any of its board members, agents, or employees when acting within the scope of their authority and the course of their employment.

       If an authority has waived its governmental immunity pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, any person, or in the event of death, their personal representative, sustaining damages as a result of an act or omission of the authority or any of its board members, agents, or employees, occurring in the exercise of a governmental function, may sue the authority for recovery of damages. To the extent of the coverage of insurance purchased pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, governmental immunity may not be a defense to the action. Otherwise, however, the authority has all defenses available to private litigants in any action brought pursuant to this section without restriction, limitation, or other effect, whether the defense arises from common law or by virtue of a statute.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Purchase of insurance pursuant to this subsection waives the authority's governmental immunity, to the extent of insurance coverage, for any act or omission occurring in the exercise of a governmental function. Participation in a local government risk pool pursuant to Article 23 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.058.html" target="_blank">Chapter 58</a></cite> of the General Statutes shall be deemed to be the purchase of insurance for the purposes of this section. By entering into an insurance contract with the authority, an insurer waives any defense based upon the governmental immunity of the authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the purchase of insurance as authorized by subsection (g) of this section, the liability of an authority for acts or omissions occurring in the exercise of governmental functions does not attach unless the plaintiff waives the right to have all issues of law or fact relating to insurance in the action determined by a jury. The judge shall hear and determine these issues without resort to a jury, and the jury shall be absent during any motion, argument, testimony, or announcement of findings of fact or conclusions of law relating to these issues unless the defendant requests a jury trial on them.

     <p>
      A public health authority board may contract directly with private vendors to operate the authority's Medicaid billing system as an alternative to the State-operated health services information system. The contract may provide for the private vendor to bill directly the State Medicaid billing system (MMIS), thereby bypassing the State health services information system (HSIS). The public health authority shall issue a "request for proposal" to solicit private vendor bids for contracts authorized under this section. Information systems authorized under this section shall be consistent with and interface with relevant statewide public health data systems to address State cost containment and service reporting needs.

       - The holder of a nonexclusive franchise has no monopoly, and cannot complain of competition from a publicly created utility system. Phrased another way, the creation by a state of a competing public utility does not amount to a "taking" compensable under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Hence, a water company had no cause of action for damages against the State, the Utilities Commission, or a sanitary district for infringement of its franchise. Durham v.

     <p>
      A sanitary district shall be incorporated as follows. Either fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the resident freeholders within a proposed sanitary district or fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the freeholders within a proposed sanitary district, whether or not the freeholders are residents of the proposed sanitary district, may petition the county board of commissioners of the county in which all or the largest portion of the land of the proposed district is located. This petition shall set forth the boundaries of the proposed sanitary district and the objectives of the proposed district. For the purposes of this Part, the term "freeholder" shall mean a person holding a deed to a tract of land within the district or proposed district, and also shall mean a person who has entered into a contract to purchase a tract of land within the district or proposed district, is making payments pursuant to a contract and will receive a deed upon completion of the contractual payments. The contracting purchaser, rather than the contracting seller, shall be deemed to be the freeholder. The county tax office shall be responsible for checking the freeholder status of those persons signing the petition. That office shall also be responsible for confirming the location of the property owned by those persons. Upon receipt of the petition, the county board of commissioners, through its chairperson, shall notify the Department and the chairperson of the county board of commissioners of any other county or counties in which any portion of the proposed district lies of the receipt of the petition. The chairperson shall request that the Department hold a joint public hearing with the county commissioners of all the counties in which a portion of the district lies concerning the creation of the proposed sanitary district. The Secretary and the chairperson of the county board of commissioners shall name a time and place within the proposed district to hold the public hearing. The chairperson of the county board of commissioners shall give prior notice of the hearing by posting a notice at the courthouse door of the county and also by publication at least once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper published in the county. In the event the hearing is to be before a joint meeting of the county boards of commissioners of more than one county, or in the event the land to be affected lies in more than one county, publication and notice shall be made in each of the affected counties. In the event that all matters pertaining to the creation of this sanitary district cannot be concluded at the hearing, the hearing may be continued at a time and place within the proposed district named by the Department.

       Services and Rates Not Subject to Control of Utilities Commission.
   
   - A sanitary district which, as a part of its functions, furnishes drinking water to the public and furnishes filtered water for industrial consumers is a quasi-municipal corporation, and is not under the control and supervision of the North Carolina Utilities Commission as to services or rates. Halifax Paper Co. v. Roanoke Rapids San. Dist., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 421</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 378 (1950), decided under former statutory provisions.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Lease of Filter Plant.
   
   - Defendant sanitary district was unable to raise funds for the construction of a filter plant and, in order to carry out the purposes for which it was created, leased a cotton mill's filter plant under an agreement that the mill should get its water at the cost of filtering and should have priority over other industrial consumers. It was held that the lease contract was in the public interest and the district had authority to execute it, and the contract was valid since it did not impair the ability of the district to discharge its duties to the public nor unlawfully discriminate between commercial customers similarly circumstanced. Halifax Paper Co. v. Roanoke Rapids San. Dist., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 421</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 378 (1950), decided under former statutory provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the facts of the preceding paragraph, the district agreed with plaintiff paper mill to furnish it water from the surplus remaining after the needs of the district and lessor enterprise had been satisfied. It was held that upon increased demand by the lessor, resulting in a diminution of the surplus available for sale to other industrial consumers, the district had the power to reduce the amount of water furnished the paper mill proportionately, since the paper mill had no right to any water except out of surplus water remaining after the requirements of the district and the lessor enterprise had been satisfied, and since there was no discrimination in service to commercial users similarly circumstanced in regard to such surplus. Halifax Paper Co. v. Roanoke Rapids San. Dist., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 421</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 378 (1950), decided under former statutory provisions.

       Unfair And Deceptive Trade Practices.
   
   - Trial court did not err by granting summary judgment for a sanitary district on a homeowners association's claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices; regardless of whether a sanitary district is entitled to sovereign immunity, as a quasi-municipal corporation it cannot be sued for unfair and deceptive trade practices. Badin Shores Resort Owners Ass'n v. Handy Sanitary Dist., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 811 S.E.2d 198 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by granting summary judgment for a sanitary district on a homeowners association's claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices because the association's complaint alleged that the district misrepresented the expected total cost of a sewer system, but it did did not support its contention with any evidence before the trial court and did not argue on appeal that the district's alleged breach of contract was accompanied by substantial aggravating circumstances.

       Just Compensation to Be Paid for Damages.
   
   - When a sanitary district, in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, took easements and rights-of-way for sewer lines over the lands of defendants, it became obligated to pay to defendants just compensation for the damage done. North Asheboro-Central Falls San. Dist. v. Canoy, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 749</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 577 (1960), decided under former statutory provisions.

      <p>
       Measure of Compensation.
   
   - Where a sanitary district condemns an easement for sewer lines, together with the perpetual right to enter upon the land for the purpose of inspecting its lines and making necessary repairs, replacements, additions and alterations thereon, with right of the landowners to use the land for all lawful purposes not inconsistent with the rights acquired by the district, the measure of compensation is the difference in the market value of the land free of the easement and the market value of the land subject to the easement. North Asheboro-Central Falls San. Dist. v. Canoy, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 749</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 577 (1960), decided under former statutory provisions.

      When the boundaries of a sanitary district which has no outstanding indebtedness are entirely located within or coterminous with the corporate limits of a city or town, fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the resident freeholders within the district may petition the board of commissioners within the county in which all or the greater portion of the resident freeholders of the district are located to dissolve the district. Upon receipt of the petition, the board of commissioners shall notify the Department, the chairperson of the board of commissioners of any other county or counties in which any portion of the district lies and the governing body of the city or town within which the district lies of the receipt of the petition, and shall request that the Department hold a joint public hearing with the board or boards of commissioners and the governing body of the city or town. The Secretary, the chairperson of the board of commissioners of the county in which all or the greater portion of the resident freeholders are located and the presiding officer of the governing body of the city or town shall name a time and place within the boundaries of the district and the city or town for the public hearing. The county board of commissioners shall give notice of the hearing by posting prior notice at the courthouse door of the county or counties and also by publication in a newspaper or newspapers circulating in the district at least once a week for four consecutive weeks. If all matters pertaining to the dissolution of the sanitary district cannot be concluded at the hearing, the hearing may be continued to a time and place determined by the Department. If, after the hearing, the Commission, the county board or boards of commissioners and the governing body of the city or town shall deem it advisable to comply with the request of the petition, the Commission shall adopt a resolution dissolving the district. All taxes levied by the sanitary district which were levied prior to but which are collected after the dissolution shall vest in the city or town. All property held, owned, controlled or used by the sanitary district upon the dissolution or which may later be vested in the sanitary district, and all judgments, liens, rights and causes of actions in favor of the sanitary district shall vest in the city or town. At the dissolution, taxes owed to the sanitary district shall be collected by the city or town.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The purpose of former G.S. 130-166
   
   appeared to be to permit the death certificate to be introduced as evidence of the fact of death, the time and place where it occurred, the identity of the deceased, the bodily injury or disease which was the cause of death, the disposition of the body and possibly other matters relating to the death. State v. Hamilton, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 330, 192 S.E.2d 24 (1972); Spillman v. Forsyth Mem. Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 406, 227 S.E.2d 292 (1976), decided under former statutory provisions.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The death certificate, when properly certified, would be prima facie evidence of the cause of death.
   
   State v. Hamilton, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 330, 192 S.E.2d 24 (1972), decided under former statutory provisions.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       While certified copies of records are admitted in evidence, the originals are not thereby made incompetent.
   
   State v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 55</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 367 (1978), decided under former statutory provisions.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Admission of Death Certificate in Criminal Proceedings.
   
   - Defendant's right to confrontation and his right to fundamental fairness in a criminal trial were violated by the admission in evidence of hearsay and conclusory statement in victim's death certificate. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1043, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1972), decided under former statutory provisions.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statements Regarding Insured's Suicide Properly Excluded.
   
   - In case brought by widow of insured to recover under life insurance policy, statements listing suicide as the cause of death in the medical examiner's report were properly excluded at trial. Drain v. United Servs. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 354 S.E.2d 269, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 630</cite>, 360 S.E.2d 85 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       In case brought by widow of insured to recover under life insurance policy, coroner's statement on death certificate that the gunshot wound killing the insured was intentionally self-inflicted was not based on personal knowledge of the events which took place and could only be described as hearsay and conclusory. The admission of such a statement would thwart the fairness of the trial and in essence shift the burden of proof on the issue of the cause of death from defendant to plaintiff. Therefore, the exclusion of this statement on the death certificate was proper. Drain v. United Servs. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 354 S.E.2d 269, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 630</cite>, 360 S.E.2d 85 (1987).

      <p>
       Exclusion of Birth Certificate in Paternity Action Held Proper.
   
   - In paternity action, trial court did not err by excluding the child's birth certificate in which the name of the father was left blank. The absence of a named father on the birth certificate had little probative value and was misleading because under subsection (f) of this section the name of the father of an illegitimate child may not be entered on the child's birth certificate without the father's sworn consent. State v. McInnis, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 338, 401 S.E.2d 774, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 274</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 848 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Unilateral Petition for Name Change Disallowed After Birth Certificate Entry.
   
   - Where unmarried parents executed an Affidavit of Paternity and entered respondent's name on the birth certificate as the father, court held that there was no authority, statutory or decisional, permitting petitioner to unilaterally change the name of her son, born out of wedlock and not yet legitimated, absent the father's consent.

      <p>
       Inquiry into Child's Best Interests Not Appropriate.
   
   - The fact that the General Assembly specifically required a "best interests of the child" inquiry in contexts such as termination of parental rights, child custody and placement, parental visitation rights, and even in the change in surname on a birth certificate following legitimization, yet failed to require such inquiry in connection with name changes under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.101.html#t101s101-2" target="_blank">G.S. 101-2</a></cite> and subsection (f) of this section, was taken as clear evidence of its intent that no such inquiry was required in these contexts. In re Crawford, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 137, 517 S.E.2d 161 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of Parental Rights.
   
   - No evidence supported terminating a father's parental rights for failure to legitimate the children because no evidence was adduced showing (1) the children were born out of wedlock or, (2) when the petition was filed, the father did not file a paternity affidavit or petition to legitimate the children, legitimate the children by marrying the children's mother, or establish paternity in court, and (3) a proffer that the father did not pay support or provide gifts or clothes since the children were in foster care did not suffice.

       Change of Name of Illegitimate Child.
   
   - A third person having care of an illegitimate child can petition to have the name of the child changed with only the consent of the child's natural mother. Where the natural mother petitions to change the name of her illegitimate child, the consent of no other person is logically required, as no other person has any "rights" inherent in that child's name.

      Session Laws 2015-272, preamble, provides: "Whereas, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), often known as 'bubble boy disease,' is a primary immune deficiency caused by several different genetic defects, most of which are hereditary; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, children born with SCID lack immunity against bacteria, viruses, and fungi and are prone to repeated and persistent infections that would not cause serious illness in a person or infant with a normal immune system; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, unless treated early, a child will mostly likely die from opportunistic infections as an infant; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, it has been known for the past 15 years that early recognition of SCID through newborn screening is critical to successful management of patients with SCID; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, Baby Carlie Nugent of Harrisburg died in 2000 at the age of 7 months from complications of SCID following a bone marrow transplant because her condition was not diagnosed until she was more than 6 months old; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, early screening for SCID prior to 3.5 months of age could have saved her life; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, development and implementation of a screening test for T-Cell lymphopenia has been accomplished, which led to the unanimous recommendation by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Service's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders of Newborns and Children in January 2010 to add SCID to the list of conditions routinely screened for at birth; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, as of November 2014, there are 26 states screening for SCID, and the North Carolina Newborn Screening Advisory Committee unanimously approved adding SCID to this State's newborn screening panel in January 2011, yet SCID screening still has not started in this State; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the leading center for treatment of SCID in the United States is located in North Carolina at the Duke University Medical Center; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, that Center demonstrated in 1999 that, if a bone marrow transplant could be performed before a baby is 3.5 months of age, there is a 94% survival rate, compared with a 70% survival rate if the infant is transplanted after that age; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, infants who do not receive a bone marrow transplant are likely to die before the age of two; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, in addition to saving lives, the early diagnosis of SCID also saves money, considering the cost of testing a SCID newborn who is not diagnosed until there is a serious infection can range from five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) to well over four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000), while the cost of transplanting a SCID infant who is not sick is usually less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000); Now, therefore,"

      If the State Health Director or the local health director determines that a 30-calendar-day limitation on freedom of movement or access is not adequate to protect the public health, the State Health Director or local health director must institute in superior court in the county in which the limitation is imposed an action to obtain an order extending the period of limitation of freedom of movement or access. If the person substantially affected by the limitation has already instituted an action in superior court in Wake County, the State Health Director must institute the action in superior court in Wake County or as a counterclaim in the pending case. Except as provided below for persons with tuberculosis, the court shall continue the limitation for a period not to exceed 30 days if it determines, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the limitation is reasonably necessary to prevent or limit the conveyance of a communicable disease or condition to others. The court order shall specify the period of time the limitation is to be continued and shall provide for automatic termination of the order upon written determination by the State Health Director or local health director that the quarantine or isolation is no longer necessary to protect the public health. In addition, where the petitioner can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that quarantine or isolation was not or is no longer needed for protection of the public health, the person quarantined or isolated may move the trial court to reconsider its order extending quarantine or isolation before the time for the order otherwise expires and may seek immediate or expedited termination of the order. Before the expiration of an order issued under this section, the State Health Director or local health director may move to continue the order for additional periods not to exceed 30 days each. If the person whose freedom of movement has been limited has tuberculosis, the court shall continue the limitation for a period not to exceed one calendar year if it determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the limitation is reasonably necessary to prevent or limit the conveyance of tuberculosis to others. The court order shall specify the period of time the limitation is to be continued and shall provide for automatic termination of the order upon written determination by the State Health Director or local health director that the quarantine or isolation is no longer necessary to protect the public health. In addition, where the petitioner can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that quarantine or isolation was not or is no longer needed for protection of the public health, the person quarantined or isolated may move the trial court to reconsider its order extending quarantine or isolation before the time for the order otherwise expires and may seek immediate or expedited termination of the order. Before the expiration of an order limiting the freedom of movement of a person with tuberculosis, the State Health Director or local health director may move to continue the order for additional periods not to exceed one calendar year each.

     <p>
      A local health director may declare an animal to be vicious and a menace to the public health when the animal has attacked a person causing bodily harm without being teased, molested, provoked, beaten, tortured or otherwise harmed. When an animal has been declared to be vicious and a menace to the public health, the local health director shall order the animal to be confined to its owner's property. However, the animal may be permitted to leave its owner's property when accompanied by a responsible adult and restrained on a leash.

        Editor's Note. -
       </b>
       <span class="s2">
        <b>
         Many of the cases below were decided under former statutory provisions relating to vicious animals.
        </b>
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose.
   
   - Former provisions relating to vicious animals were enacted for the specific purpose of protecting the public from dogs which have become vicious or a menace to public health. Swaney v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 631, 219 S.E.2d 803 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinance Valid.
   
   - An ordinance of a city making it unlawful to keep a dog which habitually or repeatedly chases, snaps at, attacks or barks at pedestrians, bicycles or vehicles is a valid exercise of the city's police power. Gray v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 176 S.E.2d 16 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       To safeguard and promote the public health, safety and convenience, municipal power to regulate the keeping and licensing of dogs within the corporate area is generally recognized, and ordinances regulating and requiring them to be registered, licensed, and at times muzzled and prevented from going at large, are within the police powers usually conferred upon the local corporation. Such ordinances are authorized by virtue of general powers and the usual general welfare clause. Gray v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 176 S.E.2d 16 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       A town ordinance dealing with dogs running at large was not inconsistent with former provisions relating to vicious animals, which were designed to provide minimum protection against vicious dogs in all parts of the State - rural, urban, small villages and large cities. With more concentrated population, cities are justified in adopting stricter regulations for dogs. Thus, a city was authorized to require a higher standard of conduct or condition with respect to the keeping of dogs within its corporate limits than was required for the State generally. Pharo v. Pearson, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 220 S.E.2d 359 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of Safety Statute as Negligence Per Se.
   
   - The violation of a statute which imposes a duty upon the defendant in order to promote the safety of others, including the plaintiff, is negligence per se, unless the statute, itself, otherwise provides. Swaney v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 631, 219 S.E.2d 803 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Insufficient to Show Dog "Vicious".
   
   - Evidence that a small dog frequently dashed into the street to bark at and pursue motorcycles, automobiles, and other noisy vehicles was not sufficient to justify classifying him as a "vicious" animal and did not make him "a menace to the public health." Sink v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 344</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 265 (1966); Gray v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 176 S.E.2d 16 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Canine courage in a contest for the championship of the neighborhood, together with determination to remain on possession of the field of battle "whence all but him had fled," was not evidence of a vicious character within the meaning of former statute. Sink v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 344</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 265 (1966).

       § 130A-201. Rabies emergency.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A local health director in whose county or district rabies is found in the wild animal population as evidenced by a positive diagnosis of rabies in the past year in any wild animal, except a bat, may petition the State Health Director to declare a rabies emergency in the county or district. In determining whether a rabies emergency exists, the State Health Director shall consult with the Public Health Veterinarian and the State Agriculture Veterinarian and may consult with any other source of veterinary expertise the State Health Director deems advisable. Upon finding that a rabies emergency exists in a county or district, the State Health Director shall petition the Executive Director of the Wildlife Resources Commission to develop a plan pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.113.html#t113sIVa22s113-291.2" target="_blank">G.S. 113-291.2(a1)</a></cite> to reduce the threat of rabies exposure to humans and domestic animals by foxes, raccoons, skunks, or bobcats in the county or district. Upon determination by the State Health Director that the rabies emergency no longer exists for a county or district, the State Health Director shall immediately notify the Executive Director of the Wildlife Resources Commission.

In establishing the Panel, the Collaboratory shall consult with (i) the Department of Health and Human Services, (ii) the Department of Environmental Quality, (iii) the Gillings School of Global Public Health, the School of Medicine, and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, (iv) the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, and (v) the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University to identify experts, including faculty members of institutions of higher education, health care providers, and health insurance providers, both within, and outside of, North Carolina to determine those who are qualified and willing to participate either on the Panel itself or as expert advisers to the Panel. The Panel shall have at least 10 members but no more than 30 members. The Collaboratory may use any monies currently available to it, including funds received through appropriations by the General Assembly, to support this study, including, but not limited to, travel-related expenses for participants. The Collaboratory may submit draft recommendations from the Panel as early as December 31, 2019, and shall submit final recommendations from the Panel no later than April 30, 2020, to the General Assembly in accordance with G.S. 120-29.5."

      - Session Laws 1991, c. 689, s. 179, which amended subsection (d) of this section by inserting "nutrition programs for the elderly administered by the Division of Aging of the Department of Human Resources and," was repealed by Session Laws 1991, c. 761, s. 37.2 since it duplicated Session Laws 1991, c. 656, s. 2.

     <p>
      Session Laws 2005-276, s. 6.37(w), provides: "The Office of State Budget and Management shall develop a methodology for computing the actual costs of collection of civil penalties by State departments and agencies. This methodology shall apply to all State departments and agencies, effective July 1, 2006."

      Session Laws 2005-276, s. 46.3, provides: "Except for statutory changes or other provisions that clearly indicate an intention to have effects beyond the 2005-2007
   fiscal biennium, the textual provisions of this act apply only
   to funds appropriated for, and activities occurring during, the 2005-2007 fiscal biennium."

     <p>
      Session Laws 2005-276, s. 46.5, is a severability clause.

      Session Laws 2009-484, s. 2(a) and (b), amended G.S. 130A-248(d), contingent on Senate Bill 202 of the 2009 Regular Session becoming law or not. Senate Bill 202 was enacted as Session Laws 2009-451, therefore the amendment by Session Laws 2009-484, s. 2(a) did not take effect, and the amendment by 2(b) did take effect.

   "G.S. 130A-148(a4) reads as rewritten." However, there is no subsection (a4) in G.S. 130-148, and it appears that the amendment was intended for G.S. 130A-248(a4). The amendment would have rewritten subsection (a4) to read as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(a4) For the protection of the public health, the Commission shall adopt rules governing the sanitation of limited food service establishments. In adopting the rules, the Commission shall not limit the number of days that limited food service establishments may operate.

       For the purpose of promoting and preserving an environment that is conducive to public health and welfare, and preventing the creation of nuisances and the depletion of our natural resources, the Department shall maintain a Division of Waste Management to promote sanitary processing, treatment, disposal, and statewide management of solid waste and the greatest possible recycling and recovery of resources, and the Department shall employ and retain qualified personnel as may be necessary to effect such purposes. It is the purpose and intent of the State to be and remain cognizant not only of its responsibility to authorize and establish a statewide solid waste management program, but also of its responsibility to monitor and supervise, through the Department, the activities and operations of units of local government implementing a permitted solid waste management facility serving a specified geographic area in accordance with a solid waste management plan.

Actions taken pursuant to this Article shall be deemed to be acts of the sovereign power of the State of North Carolina, and to the extent reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes of this section, a unit of local government may displace competition with public service for solid waste management and disposal.

         If the unit of local government incurs debt after September 1, 2017, and the issuance of the debt will be conditioned upon the unit of local government requiring that all waste collected within the county be disposed of within the landfill, for expansion of a landfill or construction of a new landfill after all necessary approvals for issuance of the debt have been obtained from the Local Government Commission in compliance with Chapter 159 of the General Statutes, including the demonstration of need and cost required by G.S. 159-216, the unit of local government may adopt and enforce such an ordinance until the date the debt associated with expansion of the landfill, or construction of the new landfill, has matured.

       Department's Responsibility for Enforcing Act Cannot Be Impaired by Estoppel.
   
   - Trial court erred in affirming the decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ), who determined that the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) was estopped from issuing a compliance order against a developer because DEQ's duty to enforce the Solid Waste Management Act, and its accompanying regulations, epitomized the type of core police power possessed by a government agency that could not be impaired by estoppel.

       Error In Applying Element of Equitable Estoppel.
   
   - Trial court erred in affirming an administrative law judge's (ALJ) determination that the Department of Environmental Quality was estopped from issuing a compliance order against a developer because the ALJ and trial court erred in their application of the elements of equitable estoppel to the facts; there was no valid basis for the developer to rely on documentation it had previously received for believing it could lawfully proceed to excavate and dispose of solid waste without a permit.

       No land may be used for a commercial hazardous waste disposal facility until fee simple title to the land has been conveyed to this State. In consideration for the conveyance, the State shall enter into a lease agreement with the grantor for a term equal to the estimated life of the facility in which the State will be the lessor and the grantor the lessee. The lease agreement shall specify that for an annual rent of fifty dollars ($50.00), the lessee shall be allowed to use the land for the development and operation of a hazardous waste disposal facility. The lease agreement shall provide that the lessor or any person authorized by the lessor shall at all times have the right to enter without a search warrant or permission of the lessee upon any and all parts of the premises for monitoring, inspection and all other purposes necessary to carry out the provisions of this Article. The lessee shall remain fully liable for all damages, losses, personal injury or property damage which may result or arise out of the lessee's operation of the facility, and for compliance with regulatory requirements concerning insurance, bonding for closure and post-closure costs, monitoring and other financial or health and safety requirements as required by applicable law and rules. The State, as lessor, shall be immune from liability except as otherwise provided by statute. The lease shall be transferable with the written consent of the lessor and the consent will not be unreasonably withheld. In the case of a transfer of the lease, the transferee shall be subject to all terms and conditions that the State deems necessary to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules. If the lessee or any successor in interest fails in any material respect to comply with any applicable law, rule or permit condition, or with any term or condition of the lease, the State may terminate the lease after giving the lessee written notice specifically describing the failure to comply and upon providing the lessee a reasonable time to comply. If the lessee does not effect compliance within the reasonable time allowed, the State may reenter and take possession of the premises.

       In the event of changes in laws or rules applicable to the facility which make continued operation by the lessee impossible or economically infeasible, the lessee shall have the right to terminate the lease upon giving the State reasonable notice of not less than six months, in which case the lessor shall have the right to secure a substitute lessee and operator.

       In the event of termination of the lease by the lessor as provided in subsection (a) of this section, or by the lessee as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the lessee shall be paid the fair market value of any improvements made to the leased premises less the costs to the lessor resulting from termination of the lease and securing a substitute lessee and operator. However, the lessor shall have no obligation to secure a substitute lessee or operator and may require the lessee to permanently close the facility.

      (3) Prior to the award of a franchise for the construction or operation of a sanitary landfill, the board of commissioners of the county or counties in which the sanitary landfill is proposed to be located or is located or, if the sanitary landfill is proposed to be located or is located in a city, the governing board of the city shall conduct a public hearing. The board of commissioners of the county or counties in which the sanitary landfill is proposed to be located or is located or, if the sanitary landfill is proposed to be located or is located in a city, the governing board of the city shall provide at least 30 days' notice to the public of the public hearing. The notice shall include a summary of all the information required to be included in the franchise, and shall specify the procedure to be followed at the public hearing. The applicant for the franchise shall provide a copy of the application for the franchise that includes all of the information required to be included in the franchise, to the public library closest to the proposed sanitary landfill site to be made available for inspection and copying by the public. The requirements of this subdivision shall not apply to franchises extended pursuant to subsection (a3) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) An applicant for a new permit for a sanitary landfill shall request each local government having jurisdiction over any part of the land on which the sanitary landfill and its appurtenances are located or to be located to issue a determination as to whether the local government has in effect a franchise, zoning, subdivision, or land-use planning ordinance applicable to the sanitary landfill and whether the proposed sanitary landfill, or the existing sanitary landfill as it would be operated under the permit, would be consistent with the applicable ordinances. The request to the local government shall be accompanied by a copy of the permit application and shall be delivered to the clerk of the local government personally or by certified mail. In order to serve as a basis for a determination that an application for a new permit for a sanitary landfill is consistent with a zoning, subdivision, or land-use planning ordinance, an ordinance or zoning classification applicable to the real property designated in the permit application shall have been in effect not less than 90 days prior to the date the request for a determination of consistency is delivered to the clerk of the local government. The determination shall be verified or supported by affidavit signed by the chief administrative officer, the chief administrative officer's designee, clerk, or other official designated by the local government to make the determination and, if the local government states that the sanitary landfill as it would be operated under the new permit is inconsistent with a franchise, zoning, subdivision, or land-use planning ordinance, shall include a copy of the ordinance and the specific reasons for the determination of inconsistency. A copy of the determination shall be provided to the applicant when the determination is submitted to the Department. The Department shall not act upon an application for a permit under this section until it has received a determination from each local government requested to make a determination by the applicant; provided that if a local government fails to submit a determination to the Department as provided by this subsection within 15 days after receipt of the request, the Department shall proceed to consider the permit application without regard to a franchise, local zoning, subdivision, and land-use planning ordinances. Unless the local government makes a subsequent determination of consistency with all ordinances cited in the determination or the sanitary landfill as it would be operated under the new permit is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be consistent with the cited ordinances, the Department shall attach as a condition of the permit a requirement that the applicant, prior to construction or operation of the sanitary landfill under the permit, comply with all lawfully adopted local ordinances cited in the determination that apply to the sanitary landfill. This subsection shall not be construed to affect the validity of any lawfully adopted franchise, local zoning, subdivision, or land-use planning ordinance or to affect the responsibility of any person to comply with any lawfully adopted franchise, local zoning, subdivision, or land-use planning ordinance. This subsection shall not be construed to limit any opportunity a local government may have to comment on a permit application under any other law or rule. This subsection shall not apply to any facility with respect to which local ordinances are subject to review under either <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.104E.html#t104Es104E-6.2" target="_blank">G.S. 104E-6.2</a></cite> or G.S. 130A-293.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Decision of the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources Division of Waste Management was not arbitrary or capricious
   
   because it articulated the factors that were considered and how those factors were weighed relative to each other before deciding to issue a permit allowing construction of a multi-state solid waste landfill; while county residents who challenged the issuance of that permit argued effectively that more thorough review or different weighing of factors would have been reasonable, the court could not find that the Department's process failed to indicate any course of reasoning and the exercise of judgment. Anson County Citizens Against Chem. Toxins in Underground Storage v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 606 S.E.2d 350 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Discretion to Determine Factors for Issuing Permits.
   
   - Since G.S. 130A-294(b2) did not contain specific factors that had to be considered before the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources Division of Waste Management could issue a permit, the statute granted broad discretion to the Department to determine what factors to consider; because a Department employee testified that he considered at least seven specific criteria, such as the Department's experience with the permitee company, whether and how any violations were resolved, whether out-of-state violations would have violated North Carolina regulations, and the nature and duration of any violations, the Department properly exercised its broad discretion to determine that the permitee company showed compliance with environmental regulations and the Department properly ruled against county residents who challenged the Department's decision to issue a permit allowing construction of a multi-state solid waste landfill in the residents' county. Anson County Citizens Against Chem. Toxins in Underground Storage v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 606 S.E.2d 350 (2004).

       County was liable to landowner for temporary taking of easement
   
   across county's landfill where regulations were promulgated under this section requiring that the facility be secured by means of gates, chains, berms, fences, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized entry. Tolbert v. County of Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 468 S.E.2d 504 (1996).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Franchise for Operation.
   
   - County that began a permitting process for a proposed landfill by submitting its site plan application on December 4, 1992, prior to the effective date of G.S. 294(b1)(3), was not required to secure a franchise for operation of the landfill pursuant to that subsection.

      <p>
       Town was Equitably Estopped from Challenging a Landfill Site Application.
   
   - Because of its actions in approving a proposed landfill site, before ultimately withdrawing its approval of the landfill site before ultimately withdrawing a neighboring town to the site was equitably estopped from challenging a county's application for a facility permit. County of Wake v. N.C. Dep't of Env't, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 225, 573 S.E.2d 572 (2002), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 62</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 387 (2003).

       The Division shall employ full-time resident inspectors for each commercial hazardous waste facility located within the State. Such inspectors shall be employed and assigned so that at least one inspector is on duty at all times during which any component of the facility is in operation, is undergoing any maintenance or repair, or is undergoing any test or calibration. Resident inspectors shall be assigned to commercial hazardous waste management facilities so as to protect the public health and the environment, to monitor all aspects of the operation of such facilities, and to assure compliance with all laws and rules administered by the Division and by any other division of the Department. Such inspectors may also enforce laws or rules administered by any other agency of the State pursuant to an appropriate memorandum of agreement entered into by the Secretary and the chief administrative officer of such agency. The Division may assign additional resident inspectors to a facility depending upon the quantity and toxicity of waste managed at a facility, diversity of types of waste managed at the facility, complexity of management technologies utilized at the facility, the range of components which are included at the facility, operating history of the facility, and other factors relative to the need for on-site inspection and enforcement capabilities. The Division, in consultation with other divisions of the Department, shall define the duties of each resident inspector and shall determine whether additional resident inspectors are needed at a particular facility to meet the purposes of this section.

The Commission shall adopt rules to determine whether a commercial hazardous waste facility is a special purpose commercial hazardous waste facility and to establish classifications of special purpose commercial hazardous waste facilities. The rules to determine whether a commercial hazardous waste facility is a special purpose commercial hazardous waste facility and to establish classifications of special purpose commercial hazardous waste facilities shall be based on factors including, but not limited to, the size of the facility, the type of treatment or storage being performed, the nature and volume of waste being treated or stored, the uniformity, similarity, or lack of diversity of the waste streams, the predictability of the nature of the waste streams and their treatability, whether the facility utilizes automated monitoring or safety devices that adequately perform functions that would otherwise be performed by a resident inspector, the fact that reclamation or recycling is being performed at the facility, and the compliance history of the facility and its operator. Based on the foregoing factors and any increase or decrease in the number of sensitive land uses over time or in estimated population density over time reported pursuant to G.S. 130A-295.01(f), rules adopted pursuant to this subsection shall establish times and frequencies for the presence of a resident inspector on less than a full-time basis at special purpose commercial hazardous waste facilities and specify a minimum number of additional inspections at special purpose hazardous waste facilities.

       <ol>
        <li id="t130Aa09s130A-295.2ol1a1">
         "Financial assurance" refers to the ability of an applicant or permit holder to pay the costs of assessment and remediation in the event of a release of pollutants from a facility, closure of the facility in accordance with all applicable requirements, and post-closure monitoring and maintenance of the facility.
        </li>
        <li id="t130Aa09s130A-295.2ol1a2">
         "Financial qualification" refers to the ability of an applicant or permit holder to pay the costs of proper design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility.
        </li>
        <li id="t130Aa09s130A-295.2ol1a3">
         "Financial responsibility" encompasses both financial assurance and financial qualification.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-295.2ol1b">
       The Commission may adopt rules governing financial responsibility requirements for applicants for permits and for permit holders to ensure the availability of sufficient funds for the proper design, construction, operation, maintenance, closure, and post-closure monitoring and maintenance of solid waste management facilities and for any corrective action the Department may require during the active life of a facility or during the closure and post-closure periods.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-295.2ol1c">
       The Department may provide a copy of any filing that an applicant for a permit or a permit holder submits to the Department to meet the financial responsibility requirements under this section to the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall review the filing and provide the Department with a written opinion as to the adequacy of the filing to meet the purposes of this section, including any recommended changes.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-295.2ol1d">
       The Department may, in its sole discretion, require an applicant for a permit to construct a facility to demonstrate its financial qualification for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a facility. The Department may require an applicant for a permit for a solid waste management facility to provide cost estimates for site investigation; land acquisition, including financing terms and land ownership; design; construction of each five-year phase, if applicable; operation; maintenance; closure; and post-closure monitoring and maintenance of the facility to the Department. The Department may allow an applicant to demonstrate its financial qualifications for only the first five-year phase of the facility. If the Department allows an applicant for a permit to demonstrate its financial qualification for only the first five-year phase of the facility, the Department shall require the applicant or permit holder to demonstrate its financial qualification for each successive five-year phase of the facility when applying for a permit to construct each successive phase of the facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-295.2ol1e">
       If the Department requires an applicant for a permit or a permit holder for a solid waste management facility to demonstrate its financial qualification, the applicant or permit holder shall provide an audited, certified financial statement. An applicant who is required to demonstrate its financial qualification may do so through a combination of cash deposits, insurance, and binding loan commitments from a financial institution licensed to do business in the State and rated AAA by Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, or Fitch, Inc. If assets of a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of the applicant or a permit holder, or a joint venturer with a direct or indirect interest in the applicant or permit holder, are proposed to be used to demonstrate financial qualification, then the party whose assets are to be used must be designated as a joint permittee with the applicant on the permit for the facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-295.2ol1f">
       The applicant and permit holder for a solid waste management facility shall establish financial assurance by a method or combination of methods that will ensure that sufficient funds for closure, post-closure maintenance and monitoring, and any corrective action that the Department may require will be available during the active life of the facility, at closure, and for any post-closure period of time that the Department may require even if the applicant or permit holder becomes insolvent or ceases to reside, be incorporated, do business, or maintain assets in the State. Rules adopted by the Commission shall allow a business entity that is an applicant for a permit or a permit holder to establish financial assurance through insurance, irrevocable letters of credit, trusts, surety bonds, corporate financial tests, or any other financial device as allowed pursuant to 40 Code of Federal Regulations § 258.74 (July 1, 2010 Edition), or any combination of the foregoing shown to provide protection equivalent to the financial protection that would be provided by insurance if insurance were the only mechanism used. Assets used to meet the financial assurance requirements of this section shall be in a form that will allow the Department to readily access funds for the purposes set out in this section. Assets used to meet financial assurance requirements of this section shall not be accessible to the permit holder except as approved by the Department. Where a corporate financial test is used that is substantially similar to that allowed under 40 Code of Federal Regulations § 258.74 (July 1, 2010 Edition), the assets shall be presumed both to be readily accessible by the Department and not otherwise accessible to the permit holder.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-295.2ol1g">
       In order to continue to hold a permit under this Article, a permit holder must maintain financial responsibility and must provide any information requested by the Department to establish that the permit holder continues to maintain financial responsibility. A permit holder shall notify the Department of any significant change in the: (i) identity of any person or structure of the business entity that holds the permit for the facility; (ii) identity of any person or structure of the business entity that owns or operates the facility; or (iii) assets of the permit holder, owner, or operator of the facility. The permit holder shall notify the Department within 30 days of a significant change. A change shall be considered significant if it has the potential to affect the financial responsibility of the permit holder, owner, or operator, or if it would result in a change in the identity of the permit holder, owner, or operator for purposes of either financial responsibility or environmental compliance review. Based on its review of the changes, the Department may require the permit holder to reestablish financial responsibility and may modify or revoke a permit, or require issuance of a new permit.

       To meet the financial assurance requirements of this section, the owner or operator of a sanitary landfill, other than a sanitary landfill for the disposal of construction and demolition debris waste, shall establish financial assurance sufficient to cover a minimum of two million dollars ($2,000,000) in costs for potential assessment and corrective action at the facility. The Department may require financial assurance in a higher amount and may increase the amount of financial assurance required of a permit holder at any time based upon the types of waste disposed in the landfill, the projected amount of waste to be disposed in the landfill, the location of the landfill, potential receptors of releases from the landfill, and inflation. The financial assurance requirements of this subsection are in addition to the other financial responsibility requirements set out in this section.

The financial assurance requirements of this subsection are in addition to the other financial responsibility requirements set out in this section.

       The Commission may adopt rules under which a unit of local government and a solid waste management authority created pursuant to Article 22 of Chapter 153A of the General Statutes may meet the financial responsibility requirements of this section by either a local government financial test or a capital reserve fund requirement.

       In addition to the other methods by which financial assurance may be established as set forth in subsection (f) of this section, the Department may allow the owner or operator of a sanitary landfill permitted on or before August 1, 2009, to meet the financial assurance requirement set forth in subsection (h) of this section by establishing a trust fund which conforms to the following minimum requirements:

       The Department may permit a combustion products landfill to be constructed partially or entirely within areas that have been formerly used for the storage or disposal of combustion products at the same facility as the coal-fired generating unit that generates the combustion products, provided the landfill is constructed with a bottom liner system consisting of three components in accordance with this section. Of the required three components, the upper two components shall consist of two separate flexible membrane liners, with a leak detection system between the two liners. The third component shall consist of a minimum of two feet of soil underneath the bottom of those liners, with the soil having a maximum permeability of 1 x 10-7 centimeters per second. The flexible membrane liners shall have a minimum thickness of thirty one-thousandths of an inch (0.030"), except that liners consisting of high-density polyethylene shall be at least sixty one-thousandths of an inch (0.060") thick. The lower flexible membrane liner shall be installed in direct and uniform contact with the compacted soil layer. The Department may approve an alternative to the soil component of the composite liner system if the Department finds, based on modeling, that the alternative liner system will provide an equivalent or greater degree of impermeability.

The response plan shall also describe the remedial actions that the landfill is required to undertake in response to detection of leakage in amounts in excess of the Action Leakage Rate. The Department shall review the response plan as a part of the permit application for the landfill. Compliance with performance of the landfill to prevent releases of waste to the environment may be determined based on leakage rate rather than monitoring well data.

   - Summary judgment to defendants and defendant-intervenors was appropriate in a commerce clause challenge to G.S. 130A-295.6, which placed limitations on the size and location of solid waste landfills, because plaintiffs failed to forecast sufficient evidence to override the General Assembly's articulated objectives and failed to show that any incidental effects on out-of-state waste outweighed the benefits to North Carolina.

      Session Laws 2012-187, s. 15.1, as amended by Session Laws 2013-413, s. 48(a), provides: "No later than July 1, 2013, the Commission for Public Health shall adopt rules to allow applicants for sanitary landfills the option to (i) apply for a permit to construct and operate a five-year phase of landfill development and apply to amend the permit to construct and operate subsequent five-year phases of landfill development; or (ii) apply for a permit to construct and operate a 10-year phase of landfill development and apply to amend the permit to construct and operate subsequent 10-year phases of landfill development, with a limited review of the permit five years after issuance of the initial permit and five years after issuance of each amendment for subsequent phases of development. No later than July 1, 2013, the Commission shall also adopt rules to allow applicants for permits for transfer stations the option to (i) apply for a permit with a five-year duration to construct and operate a transfer station; or (ii) apply for a permit with a 10-year duration to construct and operate a transfer station, with a limited review of the permit five years after issuance of the initial permit and five years after issuance of any amendment to the permit. In developing these rules, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources shall examine the current fee schedule for permits for sanitary landfills and transfer stations as set forth under G.S. 130A-295.8 and formulate recommendations for adjustments to the current fee schedule sufficient to address any additional demands associated with review of permits issued for 10-year phases of landfill development and the issuance permits with a duration of up to 10 years for transfer stations. The Department shall report its findings and recommendations, including any legislative proposals, to the Environmental Review Commission on or before December 1, 2012. The rules required by this section shall not become effective until the fee schedule set forth under G.S. 130A-295.8 is amended as necessary to address any additional demands associated with review of permits issued for 10-year phases of landfill development and the issuance of permits with a duration of up to 10 years to construct and operate transfer stations."

At the direction of the Revisor of Statues, the amendment by 2015-286 was not implemented due to the inability to distinguish which coding applies to which level of amendment. Session Laws 2017-10, s. 3.1(b), effective May 4, 2017, amended Session Laws 2015-286, s. 4.9(b), to correct this coded bill drafting issue by substituting "Section 14.20(c) of S.L. 2015-241 is rewritten to read" for "Section 14.20(a) of S.L. 2015-241 reads as rewritten."

A permittee fee credit exists when the life-of-site permit fee amount is greater than the time-limited permit fee amount. The amount of the permittee fee credit shall be calculated by (i) subtracting the time-limited permit fee amount from the life-of-site permit fee amount due for the same period of time and (ii) multiplying the difference by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years remaining in the facility's time-limited permit and the denominator of which is the total number of years covered by the facility's time-limited permit. The amount of the permittee fee credit shall be allocated in equal annual installments over the number of years that constitute the facility's remaining life-of-site, as determined by the Department, unless the Department accelerates, in its sole discretion, the use of the credit over a shorter period of time. For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions apply:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Life-of-site permit fee amount. - The amount equal to the sum of all annual fees that would be due under the fee structure set forth in G.S. 130A-295.8(d1), as enacted by Section 14.20(c) of this act, during the cycle of the facility's permit in effect on July 1, 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Time-limited permit fee amount. - The amount equal to the sum of the application fee or renewal fee, whichever is applicable, and all annual fees paid or to be paid pursuant to subsections (c) and (d) of G.S. 130A-295.8, as repealed by Section 14.20(c) of this act, during the cycle of the facility's permit in effect on July 1, 2016.

The Fund shall be used to defray expenses incurred by the Department in developing and implementing an emergency hazardous waste remedial plan and to reimburse any federal, State or local agency and any agent or contractor for expenses incurred in developing and implementing such a plan that has been approved by the Department. These funds shall be used upon a determination that sufficient funds or corrective action cannot be obtained from other sources without incurring a delay that would significantly increase the threat to life or risk of damage to the environment. This Fund may not exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000); money in excess of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) shall be deposited in the Inactive Hazardous Sites Cleanup Fund. The Secretary is authorized to take the necessary action to recover all costs incurred by the State for site investigation and the development and implementation of an emergency hazardous waste remedial plan, including attorney's fees and other expenses of bringing the cost recovery action from the responsible party or parties. The provisions of G.S. 130A-310.7 shall apply to actions to recover costs under this section except that: (i) reimbursement shall be to the Emergency Response Fund and (ii) the State need not show that it has complied with the provisions of Part 3 of this Article.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that white goods are difficult to dispose of, that white goods that contain chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants pose a danger to the environment, and that it is in the best interest of the State to require that chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants be removed from discarded white goods. This Part therefore provides for the management of discarded white goods.

       Article 5C of Chapter 105 of the General Statutes imposes a tax on new white goods to provide funds for the management of discarded white goods.

      <p>
       Except as provided in subdivision (3) of this section, a county may not use the tax proceeds for a capital improvement or operating expense that does not directly relate to the management of discarded white goods. Except as provided in subdivision (3) of this section, if a capital improvement or operating expense is partially related to the management of discarded white goods, a county may use the tax proceeds to finance a percentage of the costs equal to the percentage of the use of the improvement or expense directly related to the management of discarded white goods.

       If a county adopts and implements a plan for the management of abandoned manufactured homes pursuant to this Part, the county shall notify the responsible party and the owner of the property on whose land the abandoned manufactured home is located for each identified abandoned manufactured home in the county that the abandoned manufactured home must be properly disposed of by the responsible party within 90 days.

If the responsible party fails to comply with this order, the county shall take any action it deems reasonably necessary to dispose of the abandoned manufactured home, including entering the property where the abandoned manufactured home is located and arranging to have the abandoned manufactured home deconstructed and disposed of in a manner consistent with the plan developed under G.S. 130A-309.113(a).

       § 130A-309.130. Findings.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.130ol11">
       The computer equipment and television waste stream is growing rapidly in volume and complexity and can introduce toxic materials into solid waste landfills.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.130ol12">
       It is in the best interest of the citizens of this State to have convenient, simple, and free access to recycling services for discarded computer equipment and televisions.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.130ol13">
       Collection programs operated by manufacturers and local government and nonprofit agencies are an efficient way to divert discarded computer equipment and televisions from disposal and to provide recycling services to all citizens of this State.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.130ol14">
       The development of local and nonprofit collection programs is hindered by the high costs of recycling and transporting discarded computer equipment and televisions.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.130ol15">
       No comprehensive system currently exists, provided either by electronics manufacturers, retailers, or others, to adequately serve all citizens of the State and to divert large quantities of discarded computer equipment and televisions from disposal.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.130ol16">
       Manufacturer responsibility is an effective way to ensure that manufacturers of computer equipment and televisions take part in a solution to the electronic waste problem.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.130ol17">
       The recycling of certain discarded computer equipment and televisions recovers valuable materials for reuse and will create jobs and expand the tax base of the State.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.130ol18">
       While some computers and computer monitors can be refurbished and reused and other consumer electronics products contain valuable materials, some older and bulkier consumer electronic products, including some televisions, may not contain any valuable products but should nevertheless be recycled to prevent the release of toxic substances to the environment.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.130ol19">
       For the products covered by this Part, differences in product life expectancy, market economics, residual value, and product portability necessitate different approaches to recycling.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.130ol110">
       In order to ensure that end-of-life computer equipment and televisions are responsibly recycled, to promote conservation, and to protect public health and the environment, a comprehensive and convenient system for recycling and reuse of certain electronic equipment should be established on the basis of shared responsibility among manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and the State.

       Drinking Water Supply Well Survey and Provision of Alternate Water Supply. - No later than October 1, 2014, the owner of a coal combustion residuals surface impoundment shall conduct a Drinking Water Supply Well Survey that identifies all drinking water supply wells within one-half mile down-gradient from the established compliance boundary of the impoundment and submit the Survey to the Department. The Survey shall include well locations, the nature of water uses, available well construction details, and information regarding ownership of the wells. No later than December 1, 2014, the Department shall determine, based on the Survey, which drinking water supply wells the owner is required to sample and how frequently and for what period sampling is required. The Department shall require sampling for drinking water supply wells where data regarding groundwater quality and flow and depth in the area of any surveyed well provide a reasonable basis to predict that the quality of water from the surveyed well may be adversely impacted by constituents associated with the presence of the impoundment. No later than January 1, 2015, the owner shall initiate sampling and water quality analysis of the drinking water supply wells. A property owner may elect to have an independent third party selected from a laboratory certified by the Department's Wastewater/Groundwater Laboratory Certification program sample wells located on their property in lieu of sampling conducted by the owner of the coal combustion residuals surface impoundment. The owner of the coal combustion residuals surface impoundment shall pay for the reasonable costs of such sampling. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude or impair the right of any property owner to refuse such sampling of wells on their property. If the sampling and water quality analysis indicates that water from a drinking water supply well exceeds groundwater quality standards for constituents associated with the presence of the impoundment, the owner shall replace the contaminated drinking water supply well with an alternate supply of potable drinking water and an alternate supply of water that is safe for other household uses. The alternate supply of potable drinking water shall be supplied within 24 hours of the Department's determination that there is an exceedance of groundwater quality standards attributable to constituents associated with the presence of the impoundment. The alternate supply of water that is safe for other household uses shall be supplied within 30 days of the Department's determination that there is an exceedance of groundwater quality standards attributable to constituents associated with the presence of the impoundment. The requirement to replace a contaminated drinking water supply well with an alternate supply of potable drinking water and an alternate supply of water that is safe for other household uses set out in this subsection is in addition to any other requirements to replace a contaminated drinking water supply well with an alternate supply of potable drinking water or an alternate supply of water that is safe for other household uses applicable to the owners of coal combustion residuals surface impoundments.

       (See editor's note for applicability) Provision of Permanent Water Supply. - As soon as practicable, but no later than October 15, 2018, the owner of a coal combustion residuals surface impoundment shall establish permanent replacement water supplies for (i) each household that has a drinking water supply well located within a one-half mile radius from the established compliance boundary of a coal combustion residuals impoundment, and is not separated from the impoundment by the mainstem of a river, as that term is defined under G.S. 143-215.22G, or other body of water that would prevent the migration of contaminants through groundwater from the impoundment to a well and (ii) each household that has a drinking water supply well that is located in an area in which contamination resulting from constituents associated with the presence of a coal combustion residuals impoundment is expected to migrate, as demonstrated by groundwater modeling and hydrogeologic, geologic, and geotechnical investigations of the site, conducted in accordance with the requirements of G.S. 130A-309.214(a)(4), and the results of other modeling or investigations that may have been submitted pursuant to G.S. 130A-309.213(b)(4). Preference shall be given to permanent replacement water supplies by connection to public water supplies; provided that (i) a household may elect to receive a filtration system in lieu of a connection to public water supplies and (ii) if the Department determines that connection to a public water supply to a particular household would be cost-prohibitive, the Department shall authorize provision of a permanent replacement water supply to that household through installation of a filtration system. For households for which filtration systems are installed, the impoundment owner shall be responsible for periodic required maintenance of the filtration system. No later than December 15, 2016, an impoundment owner shall submit information on permanent replacement water supplies proposed to be provided to each household to the Department, including, at a minimum, the type of permanent water supply proposed; the location of the household and its proximity to the nearest connection point to a public water supply; projected cost of the permanent water supply option proposed for the household; and any proposal to connect to a public water supply. The Department shall evaluate information submitted by the impoundment owner and render a final decision to approve or disapprove the plan, including written findings of fact, no later than January 15, 2017. If disapproved, an impoundment owner shall resubmit a plan for the Department's approval within 30 days. No later than April 15, 2017, an impoundment owner shall notify all residents identified in the approved plan of their eligibility for establishment of a permanent water supply. Until such time as an impoundment owner has established a permanent water supply for each household required by this subsection, the impoundment owner shall supply the household with an alternate supply of potable drinking water and an alternate supply of water that is safe for other household uses. Nothing in this section shall be construed to (i) require an eligible household to connect to a public water supply or receive a filtration system or (ii) obviate the need for other federal, State, and local permits and approvals. All State entities and local governments shall expedite any permits and approvals required for such projects. The Department may grant an impoundment owner an extension of time, not to exceed one year, to establish permanent water supplies as required by this section, if the Department determines that it is infeasible for the impoundment owner to establish a permanent water supply for a household by October 15, 2018, based on limitations arising from local government resources, including limitations on water supply capacity and staffing limitations for permitting and construction activities.

      <li id="t130Aa09s130A-309.215ol1-a1">
       For variances requested by an impoundment owner, the owner shall, no earlier than one year prior to the applicable deadline, submit an application in a form acceptable to the Department which shall include, at a minimum, all of the following information: identification of the site, applicable requirements, and applicable deadlines for which a variance is sought, and the site-specific circumstances that support the need for the variance. The owner of the impoundment shall also provide detailed information that demonstrates (i) the owner has substantially complied with all other requirements and deadlines established by this Part; (ii) the owner has made good faith efforts to comply with the applicable deadline for closure of the impoundment; and (iii) that compliance with the deadline cannot be achieved by application of best available technology found to be economically reasonable at the time and would produce serious hardship without equal or greater benefits to the public. As soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days from receipt of an application, the Secretary shall evaluate the information submitted in conjunction with the application, and any other information the Secretary deems relevant, to determine whether the information supports issuance of a variance.

       Improper Dismissal of Judicial Review Petition.
   
   - Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) decision to uphold permits for the use of coal combustion residual as structural fill at open pit mines was reversed because (1) the ALJ erred in sua sponte converting a motion for summary judgment into a motion for involuntary dismissal and granting the same, as the ALJ had no such authority, and (2) issues raised by environmental groups required distinctly different reviews of the evidence under the whole record standard and of issues of law under the de novo standard, but it was unclear what standards the trial court applied, as the court reweighed the evidence and rewrote the ALJ's decision without explanation.

Whenever the Secretary determines that an imminent hazard exists he may, in addition to any other powers he may have, without notice or hearing, order any known responsible party to take immediately any action necessary to eliminate or correct the condition, or the Secretary, in his discretion, may take such action without issuing an order. Written notice of any order issued pursuant to this section shall be provided to all persons subject to the order as set out in G.S. 130A-310.3(c).

     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) There are abandoned, idle, and underused properties in North Carolina, often referred to as 'brownfields', that may have been or were contaminated by past industrial and commercial activities, but that are attractive locations for redevelopment.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The reuse, development, redevelopment, transfer, financing, and other use of brownfields is impaired by the potential liability associated with the risk of contamination.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The safe redevelopment of brownfields would benefit the citizens of North Carolina in many ways, including improving the tax base of local government and creating job opportunities for citizens in the vicinity of brownfields.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Potential purchasers and developers of brownfields and other parties who have no connection with the contamination of the property, including redevelopment lenders, should be encouraged to provide capital and labor to improve brownfields without undue risk of liability for problems they did not create, so long as the property can be and is made safe for appropriate future use.
     </p>

      - The preamble to Session Laws 2011-186, provides: "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that public health, safety, and welfare and the environment can be protected by implementing a remediation process that requires that contaminated industrial sites be cleaned up to a level that is sufficient to ensure protection of public health, safety, and welfare and the environment without excessive expenditure of public or private resources; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that there are contaminated industrial sites in North Carolina, including land and other property, surface water, and groundwater, that are adversely affected by environmental contamination due to the presence of drilling waste; hazardous and toxic materials, substances, and wastes; solid waste; oil; and other wastes, contaminants, and regulated substances; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that the presence of environmental contamination on industrial sites creates both potential and actual harm to public health, safety, and welfare and to the environment; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that this potential and actual harm results in substantial economic losses, including reduced property values and tax revenues, decreased ability to develop and expand the beneficial use of these sites, and other opportunity costs because of the uncertainties and concerns that result from the environmental contamination of these sites; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that it is in the public interest that contaminated industrial sites are cleaned up or managed in a manner that protects public health, safety, and welfare and the environment and protects groundwater that is a current or probable future water supply; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that North Carolina has numerous and varied State-managed remediation programs to address environmental contamination, including the Inactive Hazardous Sites Response Act of 1987; the hazardous waste management program administered by the State pursuant to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976; the Leaking Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Act of 1988; the Brownfields Property Reuse Act of 1997; the Dry-Cleaning Solvent Cleanup Act of 1997; the federal Superfund program administered in part by the State pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986; and the groundwater protection rules adopted by the Environmental Management Commission; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that the expenditure of public and private resources on unnecessary remediation could better be channeled to other purposes, including new development, renovation and repair, research and development, training and education, and other activities that maintain and enhance North Carolina's competitive position in the world and the excellent quality of life enjoyed by the citizens of North Carolina; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that North Carolina's groundwater is a valuable public and private resource, serving as the drinking water source for one-half of the State's population and also as a water supply for industrial and commercial uses; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that maintenance of North Carolina's surface water and groundwater resources will become increasingly important to the continued economic vitality of the State in the future; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that use of site-specific remediation standards based on an objective, scientific, and uniform approach to the evaluation of the risk posed by each contaminated site can be protective of public health, safety, and welfare and the environment; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that use of site-specific remediation standards in appropriate circumstances may encourage accelerated cleanup of contaminated industrial sites; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly intends that the levels of remediation that are established for each contaminated site are to be applicable or relevant under federal remediation programs; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the General Assembly intends that the protections afforded to public health, safety, and welfare and to the environment by existing environmental, health, and safety standards that apply to ongoing activities not be diminished in any way, in order that those standards will continue to protect against the discharge or release of contaminants to the environment that would result in additional contaminated sites; Now, therefore,"

   - Session Laws 2008-198, s. 9, provides: "For purposes of this section, 'contamination of drinking water' means any exceedance of the drinking water standards adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or by the drinking water standards adopted by the Commission for Health Services pursuant to Article 10 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.130A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 130A</a></cite> of the General Statutes. It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources aggressively compel persons who are responsible for contamination of groundwater that results in contamination of drinking water to assess and remediate the groundwater contamination as required by law."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2011-394, s. 16.1, provides: "Variance from Setbacks for Public Water Supply Wells. -
     </p>
     <p>
      "(a) The Department of Environment and Natural Resources may grant a variance from the minimum horizontal separation distances for public water supply wells set out in 15A NCAC 18C.0203(2)(d) and 15A NCAC 18C.0203(2)(e) upon finding that:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The well supplies water to a noncommunity water system as defined in G.S. 130A-313(10)(b) or supplies water to a business or institution, such as a school, that has become a noncommunity water system through an increase in the number of people served by the well.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) It is impracticable, taking into consideration feasibility and cost, for the public water system to comply with the minimum horizontal separation distance set out in the applicable sub-subpart of 15A NCAC 18C.0203(2).
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) There is no reasonable alternative source of drinking water available to the public water supply system.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) The granting of the variance will not result in an unreasonable risk to public health.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) A variance from the minimum horizontal separation distances set out in 15A NCAC 18C.0203(2)(d) and 15A NCAC 18C.0203(2)(e) shall require that the noncommunity public water supply well meet the following requirements:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The well shall comply with the minimum horizontal separation distances set out in 15A NCAC 18C.0203(2)(d) and 15A NCAC 18C.0203(2)(e) to the maximum extent practicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The well shall meet a minimum horizontal separation distance of 25 feet from a building, mobile home, or other permanent structure that is not used primarily to house animals.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The well shall meet a minimum horizontal separation distance of 100 feet from any animal house or feedlot and from cultivated areas to which chemicals are applied.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) The well shall meet a minimum horizontal separation distance of 50 feet from surface water.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that continued installation, at a rapidly and constantly accelerating rate, of septic tank systems and other types of wastewater systems in a faulty or improper manner and in areas where unsuitable soil and population density adversely affect the efficiency and functioning of these systems, has a detrimental effect on the public health and environment through contamination of land, groundwater and surface waters. Recognizing, however, that wastewater can be rendered ecologically safe and the public health protected if methods of wastewater collection, treatment and disposal are properly regulated and recognizing that wastewater collection, treatment and disposal will continue to be necessary to meet the needs of an expanding population, the General Assembly intends to ensure the regulation of wastewater collection, treatment and disposal systems so that these systems may continue to be used, where appropriate, without jeopardizing the public health.

      - Session Laws 2004-140, s. 1, provides: "A subsurface wastewater disposal system shall be located the maximum feasible horizontal distance, but not less than 10 feet from any other subsurface wastewater disposal system, when all of the following conditions are met:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The lot or tract of land on which the system will be located is specifically described in a deed, other instrument conveying fee simple title, or on a plat recorded prior to 1 July 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The lot or tract of land is of insufficient size to allow the minimum horizontal separation distance for a conventional wastewater system required in 15A NCAC 18A .1950.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The system will receive sewage from only one single-family residence not to exceed four bedrooms.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) The residence is not capable of being served by a public or community wastewater system at the time construction of the system commences.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) The system will be installed in sand or loamy sand soils as defined in 15A NCAC 18A .1935 and installed in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to Article 11 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.130A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 130A</a></cite> of the General Statutes."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2013-413, s. 34(a)-(d), as amended by Session Laws 2014-120, s. 53, provides: "(a) 15A NCAC 18A .1949(b) (Sewage Flow Rates for Design Units). - Until the effective date of the revised permanent rule that the Commission is required to adopt pursuant to Section 34(c) of this act, the Commission, the Department, and any other political subdivision of the State shall implement 15A NCAC 18A .1949(b) (Sewage Flow Rates for Design Units) as provided in Section 34(b) of this act.

       Special Duty Exception to Public Duty Doctrine Applied.
   
   - Montgomery County Health Department, an agent of the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NCDENR), was a state agency required to inspect sites for suitability of wastewater treatment systems before issuing improvement permits by G.S. 130A-336, and could avail itself of the protection afforded by the public duty doctrine; however, the special duty exception applied, as NCDENR, through the Health Department, made a promise to a property owner by issuing an improvement permit warranting that the owner could construct a three-bedroom home on the property as described in the site plan, and the owner relied on the permit in negotiating the purchase of the property.

       No Liability for Mere Negligence.

       No Tortious Intrusion into Seclusion of Decedent's Family Members.

      <p>
       A cause of action exists in this State for wrongful autopsy.
   
   The cause of action arises from a quasi-property right of the surviving next-of-kin to bury the dead without wrongful interference. Grad v. Kaasa, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 314 S.E.2d 755, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 310</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 888 (1984), decided under former G.S. 130-198 and G.S. 130-200.

      </p>
      <p>
       Violation Will Not Automatically Result in Liability.
   
   - Although the regulations and statutes limit a medical examiner's authority to order autopsies, a violation will not inevitably result in liability. A public official will be held liable only if it is shown that he acted entirely outside the scope of his authority or that his act, while inside his authority, was malicious or corrupt. Grad v. Kaasa, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 314 S.E.2d 755, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 310</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 888 (1984), decided under former G.S. 130-198 and G.S. 130-200.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Medical Examiner Is Immune from Liability.
   
   - A medical examiner acts outside his authority if he subjectively determines that an autopsy is not authorized by statute, yet proceeds anyway, or if he fails to make any subjective determination at all concerning whether an autopsy would serve the public interest before proceeding. Conversely, where a medical examiner receives a death report under G.S. 130-198 (see now G.S. 130A-383) or 10 N.C. Administrative Code

      The General Assembly of North Carolina makes the following findings and declaration:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t130Aa16s130A-414.1ol11">
       A mental or physical disability does not diminish a person's right to health care.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa16s130A-414.1ol12">
       The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., as amended, prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities, yet many individuals with disabilities still experience discrimination in accessing critical health care services.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa16s130A-414.1ol13">
       In other states nationwide, individuals with mental and physical disabilities have been denied lifesaving organ transplants based on assumptions that their lives are less worthy, that they are incapable of complying with post-transplant medical requirements, or that they lack adequate support systems to ensure compliance with post-transplant medical requirements.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa16s130A-414.1ol14">
       Although organ transplant centers must consider medical and psychosocial criteria when determining if a patient is suitable to receive an organ transplant, transplant centers that participate in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federally funded programs are required to use patient selection criteria that result in a fair and nondiscriminatory distribution of organs.
      </li>
      <li id="t130Aa16s130A-414.1ol15">
       North Carolina residents in need of organ transplants are entitled to assurances that they will not encounter discrimination on the basis of a disability.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The General Assembly hereby declares that the life of an individual with a disability who needs an organ transplant is as worthy and valuable as the life of an individual without a disability who needs the same medical service.

Section 9 further provided that the amendment by s. 1 of the act, which amended the catchline and added subsections (c), (d) and (e), would become effective only on and after the effective date of subtitle 2 of Title XXI of the Public Health Service Act, as enacted into federal law pursuant to Title III of Public Law 99-660, and only if this federal law on its effective date contained language forbidding a state from establishing or enforcing a law prohibiting an individual from bringing a civil action against a vaccine manufacturer for damages for a vaccine-related injury or death if this action is not barred by federal law.

      Section 300aa-22(e) of Title 42 of the United States Code, effective October 1, 1988, appears to contain such language.

       Requirement. - An individual shall not perform or offer to perform an inspection, risk assessment, or abatement of target housing or a child-occupied facility unless the individual is certified by the Department to perform the activity. Performance of an inspection, risk assessment, or abatement encompasses a range of activities. To ensure proper performance of all aspects of an inspection, risk assessment, or abatement, the certification requirement imposed on an individual applies to each activity. The categories of individual certification are inspector, risk-assessor, designer, supervisor, worker, and any other category required by federal law. The category of risk-assessor includes the category of inspector. Thus, a person who is certified as a risk-assessor is not required to be certified as an inspector. Otherwise, an individual who performs or offers to perform activities within the scope of more than one category must be certified in each category.

       If the State Health Director reasonably suspects that a public health threat may exist and that the threat may have been caused by a terrorist incident using nuclear, biological, or chemical agents, the State Health Director is authorized to order any of the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t130Aa22s130A-475ol1a1">
         Require any person or animal to submit to examinations and tests to determine possible exposure to the nuclear, biological, or chemical agents.

         Evacuate or close any real property, including any building, structure, or land when necessary to investigate suspected contamination of the property. The period of closure during an investigation shall not exceed 10 calendar days. If the State Health Director determines that a longer period of closure is necessary to complete the investigation, the Director may institute an action in superior court to order the property to remain closed until the investigation is completed.
        </li>

Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to restrict the access of authorized health care, law enforcement, or emergency medical services personnel to quarantine or isolation premises as necessary in conducting their duties.

       The authority under subsection (a) of this section shall be exercised only when and so long as a public health threat may exist, all other reasonable means for correcting the problem have been exhausted, and no less restrictive alternative exists. Before applying the authority under subdivision (4) or (5) of subsection (a) of this section to livestock or poultry for the purpose of preventing the direct or indirect conveyance of a biological, chemical or nuclear agent to persons, the State Health Director shall consult with the State Veterinarian in the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

       For the purpose of this Article, the term "public health threat" means a situation that is likely to cause an immediate risk to human life, an immediate risk of serious physical injury or illness, or an immediate risk of serious adverse health effects.

      The period of limited freedom of movement or access under subdivisions (4) and (5) of subsection (a) of this section shall not exceed 30 calendar days. Any person substantially affected by that limitation may institute, in superior court in Wake County or in the county in which the limitation is imposed, an action to review the limitation. The State Health Director shall give the persons known by the State Health Director to be substantially affected by the limitation reasonable notice under the circumstances of the right to institute an action to review the limitation. If a person or a person's representative requests a hearing, the hearing shall be held within 72 hours of the filing of the request, excluding Saturdays and Sundays. The person substantially affected by that limitation is entitled to be represented by counsel of the person's own choice or if the person is indigent, the person shall be represented by counsel appointed in accordance with Article 36 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7A</a></cite> of the General Statutes and the rules adopted by the Office of Indigent Defense Services. The court shall reduce or terminate the limitation unless it determines, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the limitation is reasonably necessary to prevent or limit the conveyance of biological, chemical or nuclear agents to others, and may apply such conditions to the limitation as the court deems reasonable and necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the State Health Director determines that a 30-calendar-day limitation on freedom of movement or access is not adequate to protect the public health, the State Health Director must institute in superior court in the county in which the limitation is imposed, an action to obtain an order extending the period limiting the freedom of movement or access. If the person substantially affected by the limitation has already instituted an action in superior court in Wake County, the State Health Director must institute the action in superior court in Wake County or as a counterclaim in the pending case. The court shall continue the limitation for a period not to exceed 30 days, subject to conditions it deems reasonable and necessary, if it determines by the preponderance of the evidence, that additional limitation is reasonably necessary to prevent or limit the conveyance of biological, chemical, or nuclear agents to others. The court order shall specify the period of time the limitation is to be continued and shall provide for automatic termination of the order upon written determination by the State Health Director or local health director that the limitation on freedom of movement or access is no longer necessary to protect the public health. In addition, where the petitioner can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the limitation on freedom of movement or access was not or is no longer needed for protection of the public health, the person so limited may move the trial court to reconsider its order extending the limitation on freedom of movement or access before the time for the order otherwise expires and may seek immediate or expedited termination of the order. Before the expiration of an order issued under this section, the State Health Director may move to continue the order for additional periods not to exceed 30 days each.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a health care provider or unit of State or local government willfully does not disclose information pursuant to this subsection, the immunity from civil or criminal liability provided under this subsection shall not be available if the person had actual knowledge that a condition or illness was caused by use of a nuclear, biological, or chemical weapon of mass destruction as defined in G.S. 14-288.21(c).

The order shall specify which health care providers must report, what information is to be reported, and the period of time for which reporting is required.
