        <p>
            "(2) The effectiveness of publishing information on the criteria for licensure of military spouses, as required by G.S. 93B-15.1, and whether there are additional platforms on which this information should be published to ensure broader dissemination
            to military spouses.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(3) The feasibility and effectiveness of including a question about military status, including status as a military spouse, on applications for licensure.

        <p>
            "(4) Determining what steps can be taken to provide or enhance continuing education programs to assist military spouses in maintaining an active occupational license, even if issued by another state.

            "(5) Providing training for at least one employee in the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs on the licensure process outlined in G.S. 93B-15.1 for military-trained applicants and military spouses, and considering ways in which to disseminate

            or registration requirements established by occupational licensing boards and (ii) were denied licensure. The data shall include a summary of the reasons military-trained applicants and military spouses were denied licensure, but shall not
