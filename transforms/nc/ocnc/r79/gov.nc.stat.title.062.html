                        Scope of Authority of Utilities Commission. - The Utilities Commission, being an administrative agency created by statute, has no regulatory authority except such as is conferred upon it by this Chapter, and the Commission may not, by its order, require
                        or authorize a rule or practice by a public utility company which is forbidden by statute, or authorize such company to refuse to perform a duty imposed upon it by statute, unless this Chapter has conferred such authority upon
                        the Commission. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. National Merchandising Corp., <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 715</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 304 (1975).

                        Findings Concerning Company Debt Ratios. - Conclusion of the Utilities Commission's that a natural gas company's capital structure should include a short-term debt ratio of 4.02%, based on a short-term debt equal to stored gas inventory rather than "the
                        daily average balance amount of short-term debt for the most recent twelve month period," was supported by substantial evidence and satisfied requirements of this chapter. State ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers

                    is further authorized after notice to affected parties and hearing to deregulate or to exempt from regulation under any or all provisions of this Chapter: (i) a service provided by any public utility as defined in G.S. 62-3(23)a.6.
                    upon a finding that such service is competitive and that such deregulation or exemption from regulation is in the public interest; or (ii) a public utility as defined in G.S. 62-3(23)a.6., or a portion of the business of such public
                    utility, upon a finding that the service or business of such public utility is competitive and that such deregulation or exemption from regulation is in the public interest.

                    service; (ii) interLATA long distance service; and (iii) long distance operator services. A public utility providing such services shall be permitted, at its own election, to file and maintain tariffs for such services with the Commission

                        necessity case, and the legislature's delegation of this authority to the Commission was not unconstitutional. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                        Purpose of Chapter. - The clear purpose of this Chapter is to confer upon the Utilities Commission the power and the duty to compel a public utility company to render adequate service and to fix therefor reasonable rates pursuant to the procedure prescribed

                        The primary purpose of this Chapter is not to guarantee to the stockholders of a public utility constant growth in the value of and in the dividend yield from their investment, but is to assure the public of adequate service at a reasonable charge. State

                        The provisions of this Chapter, such as G.S. 62-133, designed to assure the utility of adequate revenues, are in the nature of corollaries to the basic proposition that the public is entitled to adequate service at reasonable rates and safeguards against
                        administrative action which would violate constitutional protections by confiscation of the utility's property. Without such assurance, the owners of capital would not invest it in the utility's bonds or stock and the utility could
                        not provide the plant necessary for the rendering of adequate service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 671</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 681 (1974).

                        to compel adequate and efficient utility service to the citizens of this State, where it was clear from the Commission's findings that, without additional gas supplies, the gas utilities would be unable to render adequate service
                        to their customers, that exploration programs were the most feasible means for obtaining these additional supplies, and that the utilities were unable, through traditional methods of financing, to fund sufficient exploration projects

                        Definitions Not Controlling Where Terms Are Used Elsewhere. - The definitions of "public utility" and "franchise" contained in this section are not controlling in determining whether an agreement of a municipality constitutes a franchise or a license,
                        since the definitions of the statute do not purport to be authoritative definitions of those terms as used elsewhere. Shaw v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 90</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 139 (1967).

                        There is nothing in the language of Article 8 or of the Public Utilities Act generally to support the contention that Article 8 is not applicable to a multistate foreign corporation engaged in interstate commerce. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern

                        What Is the "Public" Dependent on Regulatory Circumstances. - Whether any given enterprise is a public utility within the meaning of a regulatory scheme does not depend on some abstract, formulistic definition of "public" to be thereafter universally
                        applied. What is the "public" in any given case depends rather on the regulatory circumstances of that case. Some of these circumstances are: (1) the nature of the industry sought to be regulated; (2) the type of market served
                        by the industry; (3) the kind of competition that naturally inheres in that market; and (4) the effect of nonregulation or exemption from regulation of one or more persons engaged in the industry. The meaning of "public" must,
                        in the final analysis, be such as will, in the context of the regulatory circumstances, accomplish the legislature's purpose and comport with its public policy. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Simpson,

                        In determining the scope of the Commission's authority, the emphasis should be placed on the public utility function rather than a literal reading of the statutory definition of "public utility," and the statutory definition should not be read so narrowly
                        as to preclude commission's jurisdiction over a function which is required to provide adequate service to the subscribers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 522</cite>,

                        are limited in capacity. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 109, 252 S.E.2d 516 (1979), aff'd in part, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 432</cite>,

                        Status of the grantee was a material factor in determining the validity of a grant of a franchise under the authority of former G.S. 160-2, for that statute authorized municipal corporations to grant franchises only to "public utilities," though it did
                        not necessarily follow that such grantee had to be the operator of a business within the definition of "public utility" contained in this section. Kornegay v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 155</cite>,

                        and necessity by the Commission to the applicant would be a nullity. It would not supply a basis for a further order conferring upon the applicant a right which may be granted only to a public utility. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                        The fact that a corporation has the authority to, and does, engage in private business in addition to its public service does not deprive it of its status as a public service corporation. A public service (public utility) corporation having the power
                        of eminent domain makes such corporation amenable to State control through the Utilities Commission. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 109, 252 S.E.2d 516

                        The word "rate," as used in the Public Utilities Act, refers not only to the monetary amount which each customer must ultimately pay, but also to the published method or schedule by which that amount is figured. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten,

                        A contract carrier is not authorized to act as a common carrier; it may not offer its services to the general public. Indeed, it may serve at most a very limited number of shippers, and then only under a private individual contract with each shipper to

                        Lessor of Vehicles Held Not Contract Carrier. - Where the owner of trucks leased them to another corporation under an agreement requiring lessor to carry insurance and maintain the vehicles and giving lessee control over the operation of the trucks with
                        right to use same exclusively for the transportation and delivery of lessee's goods, the lessor was not a contract carrier within the meaning of the statute as it stood in 1949, since the lessor merely leased its vehicles and was
                        not a carrier of any kind, and lessee was solely a private carrier; therefore, lessor was not liable for additional assessment at the "for hire" rates under the statute. Equipment Fin. Corp. v. Scheidt,

                        Former Definition of Contract Carrier Not Retroactive. - The definition of "contract carrier" in the Bus Act of 1949 (former G.S. 62-121.43 through 62-121.79) was definitive or regulatory and intended to be applied prospectively with respect to applications
                        for permits as contract carriers under the general provisions of the act, and had no bearing on or relation to the grandfather rights confirmed in the act. To make these definitive and regulatory provisions retroactive, so as to
                        place a limitation on the rights of a carrier under the grandfather clause contained in the act, would be in contravention of his constitutional rights and contrary to due process of law. Moreover, such a construction would completely
                        nullify the grandfather clause and make it feckless. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Fleming, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 660</cite>, 71 S.E.2d 41 (1952).

                    service area. A North Carolina utility that is a city or county may require the owner of the property to pay a periodic availability fee authorized by law only if the owner elects to have utility service provided to the dwelling unit
                    or commercial establishment by the North Carolina utility. A South Carolina utility that provides service to the property as authorized in this section is not a public utility under G.S. 62-3(23), and is not subject to regulation by
                    the North Carolina Utilities Commission as it relates to providing the particular utility service involved. For purposes of this section only, the term "South Carolina utility" has the same meaning as the term "utility" or "utilities"
                    in the Code of Laws of South Carolina, and the term "North Carolina utility" has the same meaning as the term "public utility" which is defined in G.S. 62-3(23), and also includes a city or county that provides any of the services
                    listed in G.S. 160A-311 or G.S. 153A-274, an authority organized under the North Carolina Water and Sewer Authorities Act, or an electric or telephone membership corporation.

                    <p>
                        The rate making activities of the Commission are a legislative function. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 598</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 862 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Rule making is an exercise of the delegated legislative authority of the Commission, under G.S. 62-30 and G.S. 62-31, to supervise and control the public utilities of this State and to make reasonable rules and regulations to accomplish that end. State
                        ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 598</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 862 (1978).

                        Benefits of 1986 Tax Reform Act to Ratepayers Through Rule Making Procedure. - The Utilities Commission may pass on to the ratepayers the benefits of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 through a rule making procedure rather than a rate making procedure. State
                        ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 190</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 118 (1990).

                        Administrative Rule Making Not Res Judicata. - Actions of an administrative agency which involve the exercise of a legislative rather than a judicial function are not res judicata. Exercises of the Commission's rule making power, therefore, are not governed
                        by the principles of res judicata and are reviewable by the Supreme Court in later appeals of closely related matters. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 598</cite>,

                        Distribution of Gain From Sale of Water and Sewage Facilities. - North Carolina Utilities Commission's assigning a portion of the gain on sale from a municipal utility's purchase of the existing water and sewer facilities of a publicly franchised utility
                        to the publicly franchised utility's remaining ratepayers, instead of assigning all of the gain on sale to the publicly franchised utility's shareholders, was approved on review pursuant to G.S. 62-94 because the Commission did
                        not violate the Commission's authority under G.S. 62-2 and G.S. 62-23. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Water Serv., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 738 S.E.2d 187 (2013).

                        The reason for strict regulation of public utilities is that they are either monopolies by nature or given the security of monopolistic authority for better service to the public. The public is best served in many circumstances where destructive competition
                        has been removed and the utility is a regulated monopoly. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 43</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 249 (1963).

                        Commission Has No Authority Other Than Granted by Legislature. - The Utilities Commission was created by the General Assembly. In fixing rates to be charged by utilities, it exercises a legislative function and has no authority other than that given to
                        it by the legislature. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. North Carolina Textile Mfrs. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 240, 296 S.E.2d 487 (1982), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 238</cite>,

                        Under G.S. 62-42(a)(5) the Commission has the authority to order the utility to take action necessary to secure reasonably adequate service for the public's need and convenience. Undoubtedly yellow pages could fall within this provision. State ex rel.

                        North Carolina Utilities Commission properly ruled that the North Carolina Waste Awareness and Reduction Network's (NC WARN) arrangement with a church to install and maintain a solar panel system constituted a public utility in violation of the Public
                        Utilities Act because NC WARN was operating as a public utility within the meaning of the Public Utilities Act; NC WARN desired to serve customers of its own choosing within an energy company's territory without oversight. State

                        was authorized because the regulation's purpose was to ensure the supply of electricity to retail customers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite>                        681, 622 S.E.2d 169 (2005).

                        Commission's Rule Making Not Res Judicata. - Actions of an administrative agency which involve the exercise of a legislative rather than a judicial function are not res judicata. Exercising of the Commission's rule-making power, therefore, are not governed
                        by the principles of res judicata and are reviewable by the Supreme Court in later appeals of closely related matters. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 598</cite>,

                        Yellow Page Revenue and Expenses Included When Utility Applies for Rate Increase. - Yellow page revenue and expenses should be included in the revenues and expenses of the company when it applies for a rate increase. This is clearly the majority rule.

                    <p>
                        Telephone utility enjoys a great advantage over all competitors in the field of directory advertising. In addition, this preferred position with all its benefits and revenues is directly related to and a result of the company's public utility function.
                        Therefore, the Utilities Commission does have the authority to include the expenses, revenues and investments related to directory advertising in its rate making proceedings. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp;

                        Incorrect Telephone Number Listings. - The Utilities Commission had jurisdiction over complaints concerning incorrect telephone number listings in the telephone directory even when the regulated utility had delegated to another company the public utility
                        function of publishing its directory which also included paid advertising. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 522</cite>, 391 S.E.2d 487 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Proper Listings in Advertisements in Yellow Pages. - If a utility elects to include yellow pages advertising in the directory which it is required to publish, then clearly proper listings in the advertisements in the yellow pages become a part of the
                        utility's "function of providing adequate service" to the public. The public is not well served by listings in the yellow pages or the white pages of the directory which are incorrect or confusing to the consuming public. State

                        Providing a correct telephone listing in the yellow pages as well as in the white pages of the directory is a utility function, and the Commission properly has jurisdiction over complaints which arise from this function. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                        Whether there shall be competition in any given field and to what extent is largely a matter of policy committed to the sound judgment and discretion of the Commission. The Commission must maintain a reasonable balance to see that the public is adequately
                        served and at the same time to see that the public and the public utilities involved are not prejudiced by the effects which flow from excessive competition brought about by excessive services. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina

                        to which she voluntarily dedicated them, so long as she was justly compensated for such service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Mackie, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 338 S.E.2d 888 (1986),

                        The rate making activities of the Commission are a legislative function. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 598</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 862 (1978).

                        Rule making is an exercise of the delegated legislative authority of the Commission, under G.S. 62-30 and this section, to supervise and control the public utilities of this State and to make reasonable rules and regulations to accomplish that end. State

                        Tax Reform Benefits Passed on to Ratepayers by Rule Making Rather Than Rate Making Procedure. - Utilities Commission may pass on to the ratepayers the benefits of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA-86) through a rule making procedure rather than a rate making
                        procedure. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 190</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 118 (1990).

                        Commission's Rule Making Not Res Judicata. - Actions of an administrative agency which involve the exercise of a legislative rather than a judicial function are not res judicata. Exercises of the Commission's rule making power, therefore, are not governed
                        by the principles of res judicata and are reviewable by the Supreme Court in later appeals of closely related matters. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 598</cite>,

                        Finding That Rule Is Reasonable and Necessary Not Required. - In adopting a rule pursuant to this section, the Utilities Commission need not make a finding of fact that the rule is reasonable and necessary in order for it to administer and enforce the
                        provisions of the Public Utilities Act. State ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. Associated Petro. Carriers, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 186 S.E.2d 612 (1972), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 158</cite>,

                        Jurisdiction of Commission to Investigate. - The Commission had the jurisdiction to investigate, upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, to determine whether any motor carrier was operating in violation of the provisions of the Bus
                        Act of 1949 (former G.S. 62-121.43 through 62-121.79). State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. McKinnon, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 1</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 134 (1961).

                        Rule Denying Rights Under Grandfather Clause. - The Utilities Commission did not have the power to promulgate a rule and then to interpret or enforce the rule in such manner as to deny the exercise of rights which the legislature in clear and express
                        terms preserved to all motor vehicle carriers of property who were in bona fide operation on January 1, 1947, and who met the additional requirements contained in the Bus Act of 1949 (former G.S. 62-121.43 through 62-121.79). State

                        Supervisory Powers of Former Corporation Commission. - There was no intent to give a schedule of the thousands of appliances used in handling the business of common carriers, nor to enumerate the countless dealings between them and their patrons which
                        the former Corporation Commission should supervise. The clearly declared purpose was to put the control and supervision of the whole matter in the hands of an impartial commission, with power to make reasonable rules and orders,
                        subject to the right of appeal by either party, the shipper or the carrier, to the courts, instead of leaving such dealing to the unrestricted will of the carrier. Corporation Comm'n v. Railroad, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 126</cite>,

                        Right of State to Regulate. - The right of the State to establish regulations for public service corporations, and over business enterprises in which the owners, corporate or individual, have devoted their property to a public use, and to enforce these
                        regulations by appropriate penalties, is firmly established. Efland v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 135</cite>, 59 S.E. 355 (1907). See also Whiting Mfg. Co. v. Carolina Aluminum Co.,

                        Railroad companies, due to the public nature of the business carried on by them and the interest which the public has in their operation, are subject as to their State business to State regulation, which may be exerted either directly by the legislative
                        authority or by administrative bodies endowed with power to that end. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. North Carolina Corp. Comm'n, 206 U.S. 1, 27 S. Ct. 585, 51 L. Ed. 933 (1907).

                        Purpose of Regulation. - An uncontrolled legal monopoly in an essential service leads, normally and naturally, to poor service and exorbitant charges. To prevent such result, the legislature has conferred upon the Utilities Commission the power to police
                        the operations of the utility company so as to require it to render service of good quality at charges which are reasonable. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>,

                        was authorized because the regulation's purpose was to ensure the supply of electricity to retail customers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite>                        681, 622 S.E.2d 169 (2005).

                        Under G.S. 62-42(a)(5) the Commission has the authority to order the utility to take action necessary to secure reasonably adequate service for the public's need and convenience. Undoubtedly yellow pages could fall within this provision. State ex rel.

                        Because G.S. 62-32 and G.S. 62-42 authorized the North Carolina Utilities Commission to compel utility companies to render adequate service and to set reasonable rates, the Commission was the proper body to hear a dispute between a power company and the
                        town. Although the town could have granted a variance to its ordinance that would have allowed the company to build the proposed new line, the ordinance was not consistent with state law, and the town cited no statutory authority
                        or precedent that required the company to seek such a variance where an administrative agency specifically designed to handle such disputes had jurisdiction. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Town of Kill Devil Hills,

                        to their customers, that exploration programs were the most feasible means for obtaining these additional supplies, and that the utilities were unable, through traditional methods of financing, to fund sufficient exploration projects

                    Whenever the Commission, after notice and hearing, finds that additional natural gas service agreements (including "backhaul" agreements) with interstate or intrastate pipelines will provide increased competition in North Carolina's natural gas industry
                    and (i) will likely result in lower costs to consumers without substantially increasing the risks of service interruptions to customers, or (ii) will substantially reduce the risks of service interruptions without unduly increasing
                    costs to consumers, the Commission may enter and serve an order directing the franchised natural gas local distribution company to negotiate in good faith to enter into such service agreements within a reasonable time. In considering
                    costs to consumers under this section, the Commission may consider both short-term and long-term costs.

                        of adequate service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 204 S.E.2d 529, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 671</cite>, 208

                        Under G.S. 62-32 and this section, the Utilities Commission is given the power and the duty to compel utility companies to render adequate service and to set reasonable rates for such service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten,

                        North Carolina Utilities Commission's conclusion that it had jurisdiction to review, prior to execution, proposed wholesale electric energy contracts granting native load priority supplied from a utility to retail ratepayers and to take appropriate action
                        to protect reliable service to retail customers in North Carolina by obtaining written notice prior to the execution of any wholesale electric energy contracts in interstate commerce for its consent was vacated as the matter was
                        preempted by the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C.S.

                        There was no conflict between G.S. 62-106 and G.S. 62-42 because they served different purposes and were reconcilable; the provisions of G.S. 62-100 through G.S. 62-107 dealt with the siting of certain large transmission lines and were not applicable
                        to the case, and G.S. 62-42 was much broader in scope, dealing with compelling any type of needed improvement to a public utility system. The siting of lines of at least 161 kV was often controversial and the legislature's decision
                        to require specialized procedures for the siting of these lines was logical. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Town of Kill Devil Hills, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 561, 670 S.E.2d 341 (2009),

                    <p>
                        Town's ordinances, as applied to a power company's proposed transmission line, were invalid given the North Carolina Utilities Commission's G.S. 62-42 authority and duty to compel a power company to complete certain improvements in accordance with the
                        purposes of the Public Utilities Act. The Commission appropriately placed the burden of proof as to the validity of the ordinances on the power company; once the Commission became aware of hazardous conditions affecting a public
                        utility or its service to the public, the Commission was obligated to remedy the situation. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Town of Kill Devil Hills, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 561, 670 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Because G.S. 62-32 and G.S. 62-42 authorized the North Carolina Utilities Commission to compel utility companies to render adequate service and to set reasonable rates, the Commission was the proper body to hear a dispute between a power company and the
                        town. Although the town could have granted a variance to its ordinance that would have allowed the company to build the proposed new line, the ordinance was not consistent with state law, and the town cited no statutory authority
                        or precedent that required the company to seek such a variance where an administrative agency specifically designed to handle such disputes had jurisdiction. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Town of Kill Devil Hills,

                        Thus, Commission Is Without Authority to Compel Duplicate Telephone Service. - A reading of this section in pari materia with G.S. 62-110 results in the determination that the Commission does not have the authority to compel a public utility to provide
                        local exchange service to an area which is already receiving such service from another public utility. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel.

                        to their customers, that exploration programs were the most feasible means for obtaining these additional supplies, and that the utilities were unable, through traditional methods of financing, to fund sufficient exploration projects

                <p>
                    The Utilities Commission may adopt appropriate rules and regulations which would allow public utilities to temporarily interrupt service when a structure is moved by the owner of such structure (or by a licensed mover authorized and acting on behalf of
                    the owner) over or along public roads or streets and there are public utility facilities in place which would impede the movement of such structure. Such rules and regulations shall require:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li id="t62a03s62-52ol11">
                        The owner to demonstrate that the public health and safety of the utility's customers and that of the general public will not be affected by the interruption of such service,

                </ol>
                <p>
                    Should the owner and the public utility be unable to agree on a practical procedure and/or the direction to follow in overcoming the impeding facilities in order that the public health and safety of the utility's customers and that of the general public
                    will not be affected, then and in such event the owner may petition the Utilities Commission to require the utility to temporarily interrupt its service to its customers by disconnecting the impeding facilities, provided the owner
                    can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that the public health and safety of the utility's customers and that of the general public will not be affected by such interruption of service and that the public utility was
                    unreasonable in the procedure, direction and cost proposed to the owner to overcome the impeding facility.

                <p>
                    In any event, the owner of said structure shall reimburse the utility its full cost involved in such disconnection and reconnection including but not limited to planning, engineering, notification and administrative costs, labor, material and equipment.
                    Should the impeding facility be overcome other than by disconnection, the owner shall nevertheless reimburse the utility its full cost related thereto.

                    and jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction as to all subjects over which the Commission has or may hereafter be given jurisdiction by law. The commissioners and members of the Commission's staff designated and assigned as
                    examiners shall have full power to administer oaths and to hear and take evidence. The Commission shall render its decisions upon questions of law and of fact in the same manner as a court of record. A majority of the commissioners
                    shall constitute a quorum, and any order or decision of a majority of the commissioners shall constitute the order or decision of the Commission, except as otherwise provided in this Chapter.

                        Commission Is Administrative Agency with Powers of a Dual Nature. - The Utilities Commission, a creature of the General Assembly, is an administrative agency of the State, with such powers and duties as are given it by this Chapter. These powers and duties

                        Commission Is Without Inherent Powers of Appellate Court. - The North Carolina Utilities Commission is a court of general jurisdiction only as to subjects embraced within this Chapter. It is a court of original jurisdiction and does not possess the inherent
                        powers of an appellate court. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Norfolk S. Ry., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 762</cite>, 32 S.E.2d 346 (1944).

                        Liberality and informality are essential to the workings of the Commission. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolinas Comm. for Indus. Power Rates &amp; Area Dev., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 560</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 325

                        Ordinarily, the procedure before the Commission is more or less informal, and is not as strict as in superior court, nor is it confined by technical rules. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolinas Comm. for Indus. Power Rates &amp; Area Dev., Inc.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 560</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 325 (1962); State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Western Carolina Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 369</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 873 (1963); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. M.L.

                        The Commission is required by G.S. 62-65 (a) in deciding on an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to apply the rules of evidence applicable in civil actions in the superior court "insofar as practicable." This section provides
                        that the Commission shall render its decision "in the same manner as a court of record." The procedure before the Commission is, however, not as formal as that in litigation conducted in the superior court. State ex rel. Utils.

                    <p>
                        Since the regulation of public utilities is a continuing and continuous process as to each utility, procedure before the Commission must be more or less informal and not confined by technical rules, in order that regulation may be consistent with changing
                        conditions. State ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. Associated Petro. Carriers, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 186 S.E.2d 612 (1972), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 158</cite>, 188

                        Issues of Fact Not to Be Decided Before All Evidence Is Offered. - It is erroneous if controverted questions of fact, or issues of fact, are decided by the Commission before all of the competent evidence of the parties is offered with respect thereto.

                    <p>
                        Findings Must Be Supported by Competent Evidence. - Since the Commission is required to render its decisions upon questions of law and of fact in the same manner as a court of record, its findings must be, as a matter of law, supported by competent evidence.
                        State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Rail Common Carriers, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 314, 256 S.E.2d 508 (1979).

                        Finding May Be Based on "Late" Exhibits. - The statutes prescribing the procedure for hearings before the Commission do not forbid it to make a finding, as to the capacity and ability of an applicant for a certificate of public convenience and necessity
                        to serve, upon the basis of facts arising between the conclusion of the hearing and the entry of the order, when those facts are shown by "late" exhibits, otherwise competent, and when the adverse party has had adequate notice
                        that such exhibits have been filed with the Commission for inclusion in the record. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 257</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 100

                    <p>
                        Findings of Fact Not Disagreed with in Other Opinions as Those of Commission. - Where neither of the two concurring opinions nor the two dissenting opinions indicated any disagreement with any of the findings of fact stated in the opinion of another commissioner,
                        and the opinion of no other commissioner suggested any other findings of fact, the findings of fact so stated in the opinion of the commissioner were, therefore, concurred in by a majority, if not all of the members of the Commission,
                        and were, therefore, the findings of the Commission. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 257</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 100 (1966).

                    <p>
                        Different Reasons Given by Concurring Commissioners Are Not Grounds for Reversal. - When this section and G.S. 62-79(a) are construed together, as they must be, it is apparent that the General Assembly did not intend that an order of the Commission concurred
                        in by the majority of its members, based upon findings of fact concurred in by a majority of its members, might be reversed solely because the members of the concurring majority chose different rules, or supposed rules, of law
                        as support for their decision and order. The diversity of the reasons given by the three commissioners who join in an ultimate decision and order are not a sufficient ground for its reversal. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina
                        Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 257</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 100 (1966).

                    <p>
                        Order in Opinion Concurred in by Majority Is Order of Commission. - Where a majority of the commissioners concurred in the order set forth in the opinion by one of them, it was the order of the Commission. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel.
                        &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 257</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 100 (1966).

                    <p>
                        If three commissioners concur, the order entered by them constitutes the order of the Commission. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 204 S.E.2d 181 (1974).

                    <p>
                        But all commissioners concurring must have heard evidence. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 204 S.E.2d 181 (1974).

                    <p>
                        It seems inconceivable that the General Assembly intended that when a matter was heard by a hearing division, if "as many as three commissioners hearing the case approved the recommended order," as provided by G.S. 62-76, the order should become a final
                        order, but that the Commission, when a matter was heard before it, could issue a final order when only one of the commissioners who heard the case approved the order. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 204 S.E.2d 181 (1974).

                    <p>
                        Order Approved by Only One Commissioner Not Final. - An order was held to be a recommended order and not a final order where only one of the three commissioners who had heard the evidence in a hearing before the Commission participated in approving the
                        order. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 204 S.E.2d 181 (1974).

                    <p>
                        Res Judicata. - Only specific questions actually heard and finally determined by the Commission in its judicial character are res judicata, and then only as to the parties to the hearing. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolinas Comm. for Indus. Power
                        Rates &amp; Area Dev., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 560</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 325 (1962).

                    <p>
                        Actions of an administrative agency which involve the exercise of a legislative rather than a judicial function are not res judicata. Exercises of the Commission's rule making power, therefore, are not governed by the principles of res judicata and are
                        reviewable by the Supreme Court in later appeals of closely related matters. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 598</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 862 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Deferring Use of Increased Rates Pending Investigation. - After rates for certain intrastate shipments had been duly established by the Utilities Commission, defendant sought to increase such rates by filing tariff schedules to that effect. The Commission,
                        in a proceeding to which defendant was a party, by order of postponement, which was not objected to, deferred use of the new increased rates pending investigation, and also directed that the rates previously fixed should not be
                        changed by subsequent tariffs or schedules until this investigation and suspension proceeding had been disposed of, continuing the investigation from time to time at the request of defendant. It was held that such action of the
                        Commission was binding on defendant. However, defendant was entitled to a reasonable time to comply with the order before penalties might be invoked. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Atlantic C.L.R.R.,

Carriers, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite>                        554, 186 S.E.2d 612 (1972), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 158</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 364 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Findings May Be Based on "Late" Exhibits. - The statutes prescribing the procedure for hearings before the Commission do not forbid it to make a finding, as to the capacity and ability of an applicant for a certificate of public convenience and necessity
                        to serve, upon the basis of facts arising between the conclusion of the hearing and the entry of the order, when those facts are shown by "late" exhibits, otherwise competent, and when the adverse party has had adequate notice
                        that such exhibits have been filed with the Commission for inclusion in the record. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 257</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 100

                        Judicial Notice of Financial Data. - Although the record before the Commission did not include testimony or documentary evidence as to the earnings of the 24 electric utilities whose earnings were shown in Moody's Investment Service, subsection (b) expressly
                        authorizes the Commission to take judicial notice of data published by reputable financial reporting services, so that there was no error in the consideration of this data by the Commission in determining a fair rate of return

                    <p>
                        Judicial Notice of Industry Trend. - The Utilities Commission did not act arbitrarily in judicially noticing the current restructuring trend in the electric utility industry, where the reality of this trend was not subject to reasonable dispute because
                        it was generally known within the industry. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Indus. Group For Fair Util. Rates, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 503 S.E.2d 697 (1998), cert. denied,

                    Complaints may be made by the Commission on its own motion or by any person having an interest, either direct or as a representative of any persons having a direct interest in the subject matter of such complaint by petition or complaint in writing setting
                    forth any act or thing done or omitted to be done by any public utility, including any rule, regulation or rate heretofore established or fixed by or for any public utility in violation of any provision of law or of any order or rule
                    of the Commission, or that any rate, service, classification, rule, regulation or practice is unjust and unreasonable. Upon good cause shown and in compliance with the rules of the Commission, the Commission shall also allow any such
                    person authorized to file a complaint, to intervene in any pending proceeding. The Commission, by rule, may prescribe the form of complaints filed under this section, and may in its discretion order two or more complaints dealing with
                    the same subject matter to be joined in one hearing. Unless the Commission shall determine, upon consideration of the complaint or otherwise, and after notice to the complainant and opportunity to be heard, that no reasonable ground
                    exists for an investigation of such complaint, the Commission shall fix a time and place for hearing, after reasonable notice to the complainant and the utility complained of, which notice shall be not less than 10 days before the
                    time set for such hearing.

                        as to preclude commission jurisdiction over a function which is required to provide adequate service to the subscribers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 522</cite>,

                        Evidence of Actual Costs of Shipments by Protestant Not Required. - In a complaint proceeding to determine the reasonableness of proposed increased intrastate rates for the shipment of crude earth by rail, respondent railroads were not required to present
                        evidence of actual costs of shipments by protestant brick company between its mine and its manufacturing plant, since the appropriate group or class for the Utilities Commission's consideration was not protestant as an individual

                        The Utilities Commission was without jurisdiction to require VEPCO to comply with regulations of the Roanoke Voyages Corridor Commission, or to effect and encourage restoration, preservation, and enhancement of the appearance and aesthetic quality of
                        the U.S. Highway 64 and 264 travel corridor through Roanoke Island, to bear the additional expense of supplying electrical service through underground facilities. The Corridor Commission did not argue or allege inadequate service
                        or unreasonable rates, so the complaint was properly dismissed. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Roanoke Voyages Corridor Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 324, 332 S.E.2d 753 (1985).

                        Providing a correct telephone listing in the yellow pages as well as in the white pages of the directory is a utility function, and the Commission properly has jurisdiction over complaints which arise from this function. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                        Incorrect Telephone Number Listings. - The Utilities Commission had jurisdiction over complaints concerning incorrect telephone number listings in the telephone directory even when the regulated utility had delegated to another company the public utility
                        function of publishing its directory which also included paid advertising. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 522</cite>, 391 S.E.2d 487 (1990).

                        Proper Listings in Advertisements in Yellow Pages. - If a utility elects to include yellow pages advertising in the directory which it is required to publish, then clearly proper listings in the advertisements in the yellow pages become a part of the
                        utility's "function of providing adequate service" to the public. The public is not well served by listings in the yellow pages or the white pages of the directory which are incorrect or confusing to the consuming public. State

                    "Whereas, the resulting competition between traditional telephone service providers, cable companies offering communications services, Voice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers, wireless communications service providers, and other communications service
                    providers promotes and continues to promote additional consumer choices for these services; and

                        The burden is upon carriers asking for an increase in rates to prove justification for the increase and that the proposed rate is just and reasonable. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 317</cite>,

                        Burden Not upon Shippers or Customers. - At a hearing on a proposed increase in charges for railroad services, the shippers and customers of the railroads have no burden of proving anything; the previous rates are presumed to be fair and reasonable and
                        so are the orders of the Commission. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 317</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 210, modified, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 204</cite>, 150

                        Burden of Proof as to Counterclaim. - Where the challenge to the rate of return arose from protestants' counterclaim, the protestants were therefore complainants, and the burden was upon them. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolinas Comm. for Indus.

                        Legality of Rule Placing Burden upon All Carriers as to All Rates. - This section uses the word "carrier" or "utility" in the singular. Therefore, when the Commission initiates an investigation of the entire rate structure of motor carriers, and places
                        upon the carriers the burden of showing that the old rates, which have been in effect for a number of years with the approval of the Commission, are just and reasonable, a question arises as to whether the Commission has exceeded
                        its legislative authority. See State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. North Carolina Motor Carriers Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 432</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 271 (1960).

                        Ordinarily, the procedure before the Commission is more or less informal and is not as strict as in superior court, nor is it confined by technical rules; substance and not form is controlling. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Champion Papers, Inc.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 449</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 890 (1963).

                        This section requires the Commission to find all facts essential to a determination of the question at issue. Having found the facts, it may then make factual conclusions. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Haywood Elec. Membership Corp.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 59</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 865 (1963).

                        The reason for compelling adequate factual findings is to permit proper judicial review. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Haywood Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 59</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 865 (1963).

                        The duty imposed is similar to that duty imposed on a judge of the superior court by former G.S. 1-185 when a jury trial is waived, and on the Industrial Commission by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.097.html#t97a01s97-84" target="_blank">G.S. 97-84</a></cite>                        before it can award or deny compensation.

                        Power to Alter or Amend Orders. - Whatever the effect of subsection (c) of this section on an order filed by a panel of three Commissioners, this does not affect the power of the Utilities Commission to act pursuant to G.S. 62-80. G.S. 62-80 provides
                        the Utilities Commission may "alter or amend" an order after a hearing. By using the words "alter or amend" the legislature intended that the Commission may change an order in some respects without considering all factors that
                        must be considered in a general rate case. The statute does not limit changes in orders to those that have not become final. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Serv. Co., <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite>                        448, 297 S.E.2d 119 (1982).

                        Failure to Make Findings Necessitates Remand. - A failure by the Commission to find facts essential to a determination of the rights of the parties necessitates a remand to the Commission to make necessary findings on which it may base its order. State
                        ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Haywood Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 59</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 865 (1963).

                        Improper Appeal. - To allow an appeal from a recommended order to which no exception has been taken and which has become the final order of the full Commission by operation of the statute would allow a party, in effect, to "bypass" the full Commission,
                        usurping the administrative agency's authority. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Water Serv., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 493</cite>, 439 S.E.2d 127 (1994).

                        The Commission is required to set forth factors it considers in fixing reasonable and just rates which are not enumerated in G.S. 62-133. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Duke Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 1</cite>, 287

                        Questions of Original and Replacement Costs as "Material Issues of Fact". - When the record before the Commission presents questions of the original cost, less depreciation and the replacement cost, less depreciation, these are "material issues of fact,"
                        upon each of which the Commission must make its finding. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 189 S.E.2d 777 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Determination of "Fair Value". - Having made properly supported findings, it is for the Commission, not the reviewing court, to determine, in its expert discretion and by the use of "balanced scales," the relative weights to be given these several factors
                        in ascertaining the ultimate fact of "fair value." State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 189 S.E.2d 777 (1972).

                    <p>
                        While the Commission has the duty to weigh evidence of "fair value" fairly and in "balanced scales," the reviewing court may not set aside the Commission's determination of "fair value" merely because the court would have given the respective elements
                        different weights and would, therefore, have arrived at a different "fair value." State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 189 S.E.2d

                        Failure to include all necessary findings of fact is an error of law and a basis for remand under G.S. 62-94(b)(4) because it frustrates appellate review. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Staff, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 26</cite>,

                    <p>
                        The Commission's order must be sufficient within itself to comply with the statute. Failure to include all necessary findings of fact and details is an error of law and a basis for remand under G.S. 62-94(b)(4) because it frustrates appellate review.

                    <p>
                        The Commission was required to make specific findings showing what effect, if any, it gave to financing costs or down market protection, or both, in arriving at its common equity rate of return decision. Failure to do so constituted an error of law requiring
                        a remand for further proceedings. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Staff-North Carolina Utils. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 689</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 567 (1988).

                        Findings Must Be Supported by Competent Evidence. - Since the Commission is required to render its decisions upon questions of law and of fact in the same manner as a court of record, its findings must, as a matter of law, be supported by competent evidence.

                        Findings Held Sufficient. - Where its final order showed that the Commission arrayed factors suggesting a higher rate of return against those suggesting a lower rate, and appellant's evidence was given substantial weight in the Commission's ultimate conclusion,
                        the Commission's order was sufficiently detailed, and its findings in support of its conclusion were adequate to comply with this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Staff-North Carolina Utils. Comm'n,

                        Utilities Commission's decision to accept an expert's recommendation of an 11.4% return on equity, based on the credibility and objectivity of his company-specific "discounted cash flow" analysis, was independently reached and supported by competent,

                        Reversal and remand of that portion of a North Carolina Utilities Commission's order in which it authorized a 10.2 percent return on equity for a utility company was appropriate because the order did not contain sufficient findings of fact regarding the
                        impact of changing economic conditions on customers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 430</cite>, 758 S.E.2d 635 (2014).

                        North Carolina Utilities Commission did not err by approving a utility company's adjustments to a study of the costs of providing retail electric service to a large industrial customer because there was substantial evidence in the record, including the
                        testimony of three expert witnesses, to support the Commission's findings. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 430</cite>, 758 S.E.2d 635 (2014).

                        Order of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, authorizing a percentage of return on equity for a utility company, was appropriate because the order contained sufficient findings of fact to demonstrate that the order was supported by competent, material,
                        and substantial evidence in view of the entire record. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 644</cite>, 766 S.E.2d 827 (2014).

                    <p>
                        North Carolina Utilities Commission's findings of fact demonstrated that the Commission considered the impact of changing economic conditions upon customers and specified how this influenced the Commission's decision to authorize a 10.2 percent return
                        on equity; the findings were supported by the evidence, including public witness testimony, expert testimony, and the parties' stipulation, and thus the Commission made sufficient findings regarding the impact of changing economic
                        conditions upon customers and these findings were supported by substantial evidence. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 741</cite>, 767 S.E.2d 305 (Jan. 23, 2015).

                    <p>
                        North Carolina Utilities Commission properly concluded it was in the public interest to allow a public utility to utilize a rate adjustment mechanism because its determination was supported by substantial evidence; the Commission thoroughly explained
                        how the utility's use of a rate adjustment mechanism would benefit its customers and took meaningful steps to ensure that problems were addressed and that customers were charged after the utility made improvements to its service.

                        Reasons for Rejecting Uncontradicted Opinion Testimony. - The Commission is not, as a matter of law, required to set forth in its order its reasons for rejecting uncontradicted opinion testimony; however, it is the better practice for the Commission to
                        do so. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Duke Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 1</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 786 (1982).

                        In a complaint proceeding to determine the reasonableness of proposed increased intrastate rates for the shipment of crude earth by rail, the Utilities Commission was not required to make a specific finding that an emergency or change of circumstances
                        not affecting the entire rate structure had occurred in order to allow a change in the rates. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Boren Clay Prods. Co., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 263, 269 S.E.2d

                        concurred in by the majority of its members, based upon findings of fact concurred in by a majority of its members, might be reversed solely because the members of the concurring majority chose different rules, or supposed rules,
                        of law as support for their decision and order. The diversity of the reasons given by the three commissioners who join in an ultimate decision and order are not a sufficient ground for its reversal. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                        Order prescribing different Private Line Service rates for AT&amp;T's nonreseller (end user) customers and its reseller customers upon its face was discriminatory, and absent legally adequate reasons in the order why it was not unjustly discriminatory
                        within the meaning of G.S. 62-2(4), the order would be vacated and the cause remanded to the Commission for further proceedings. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. AT &amp; T Communications of S. States, Inc.,

                        Order Setting Return on Common Equity Improper. - North Carolina Utilities Commission's (Commission) order approving a 10.5 percent return on common equity was not supported by substantial evidence under G.S. 62-94(b) and did not comply with G.S. 62-79(a)
                        where: (1) although the 10.5 percent return on common equity agreed to in a non-unanimous stipulation fell within the range of returns on common equity recommended by the witnesses, no witness specifically recommended an return
                        on common equity of 10.5 percent; (2) the Commission did not weigh any testimony presented, but merely recited the witnesses' testimony; (3) the Commission did not discuss why one witness's testimony was more credible than another's
                        or which methodology was afforded the greatest weight; (4) the Commission adopted the stipulated return on common equity wholesale, as opposed to considering it as one piece of evidence to be weighed in making an otherwise independent
                        determination based on the G.S. 62-133 factors; and (5) the Commission failed to make findings of fact regarding the impact of changing economic conditions on customers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper,

                        already compiled, without requiring institution of a new and independent proceeding by complaint or otherwise. State ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite>                        625, 514 S.E.2d 276 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Authority to Rescind, Alter or Amend Is Discretionary. - The statutory authority of the Utilities Commission to rescind, alter or amend any order or decision made by it, upon proper notice to parties and after opportunity for hearing, is obviously discretionary.

                        General Rate Hearing Not Required for Amendment. - This section requires that the procedures of complaint hearings shall be used before amending an order but it does not require a general rate hearing before an order may be amended. State ex rel. Utils.

                    <p>
                        Effect of G.S. 62-78(c) on Power to Alter or Amend. - Whatever the effect of G.S. 62-78(c) on an order filed by a panel of three Commissioners, this does not affect the power of the Utilities Commission to act pursuant to this section. This section provides
                        that the Utilities Commission may "alter or amend" an order after a hearing. By using the words "alter or amend" the legislature intended that the Commission may change an order in some respects without considering all factors
                        that must be considered in a general rate case. The statute does not limit changes in orders to those that have not become final. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Serv. Co., <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite>                        448, 297 S.E.2d 119 (1982).

                    <p>
                        Reconsideration Until Order Is Final. - At least until an order becomes final by expiration of the time allowed for appeal, this section authorizes the Commission, upon its own motion or upon the motion of any party, to reconsider a previously issued
                        order, upon proper notice and hearing, upon the record already compiled, without requiring the institution of a new and independent proceeding by complaint or otherwise. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten,

                    <p>
                        Modification, etc., Based on Prior Misapprehension of Facts. - This section is broad enough to permit the Commission to modify and amend its order, even substantially, where, upon further consideration of the record before it, the Commission comes to
                        the opinion that its order was due to the Commission's misapprehension of the facts, or disregard of facts, shown by the evidence received at the original hearing. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten,

                        The Commission may not arbitrarily or capriciously rescind its order approving a contract between utilities. It must appear that such rescission is made because of a change of circumstances requiring it in the public interest. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                        In the absence of statutory authority, and in the absence of any additional evidence or a change in conditions, the Commission has no power to reopen a proceeding and modify or set aside an order theretofore made by it, where the order was made in pursuance
                        of an agreement entered into by the parties to the proceeding. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 43</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 249 (1963).

                    <p>
                        Circumstances Justifying Rescission of Prior Order Approving Agreement Between Carriers. - The improvement and construction of highways between two municipalities making feasible a new and quicker bus route between them was a sufficient change of condition
                        to empower the Utilities Commission to modify or rescind a prior order entered by it approving an agreement between two carriers in regard to their respective services to the public between the two municipalities along the older
                        routes. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 43</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 249 (1963).

                        Revocation of Prior Order Reversed. - An order of the Utilities Commission revoking its prior order approving an agreement between carriers in regard to their respective services along the route in question and substituting in lieu thereof an order of
                        the Commission having the same effect as the agreement, was reversed, there being no evidence to support the Commission's conclusion that the new order would promote harmony among the carriers, and there being no showing of a change
                        of condition requiring a revision of the prior order in the public interest. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 43</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 249 (1963).

                        "Complaint Proceeding" Distinguished from General Rate Case. - A hearing pursuant to the provisions of this section and G.S. 62-136 which involves a single rate or small part of a rate structure of a public utility is called a "complaint proceeding."
                        It differs from a general rate case in that it deals with an emergency or change of circumstances which does not affect the entire rate structure of a utility and may be resolved without involving the procedure outlined in G.S.

                        the Commission a bond with sureties approved by the Commission, or an undertaking approved by the Commission, in such amount as the Commission determines will be reasonably sufficient to discharge the obligation hereinabove imposed
                        upon such appealing party. The Commission may, when there are two or more such appealing parties, permit them to file a joint bond or undertaking. If the award order of the Commission is affirmed on appeal, the Commission shall
                        determine the amount, if any, of damages sustained by the party to whom the certificate was awarded, and shall issue appropriate orders to assure that such damages be paid and, if necessary, that the bond or undertaking be enforced.

                            Because the Utilities Commission's order regarding funding for a non-profit research organization did not impact rates and because any rate increases would have been effectuated at subsequent rate cases, intervenor-utility customers association was not
                            an "aggrieved party" within the meaning of this section and, thus, lacked standing to appeal. State ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite>                            127, 542 S.E.2d 247 (2001).

                            a court of record, with all the powers and jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction as to all subjects embraced within the purview of the statute, for which procedure was prescribed and authorized, with the right in

                            orders having been entered in proceedings to which plaintiffs were parties, it was held that plaintiffs had an adequate remedy for the protection of their rights by appeal under former G.S. 62-19 and 62-20, and judgment sustaining

                            Former statute, providing that "from all decisions or determinations made by the Corporation Commission any party affected thereby shall be entitled to an appeal," necessarily meant from a decision which affected or purported to affect some right or interest

                            Under the provisions of former G.S. 62-20, "any party affected" by the order of the Commission as to rates or charges for passengers by a street railway company, etc., was given the right of appeal to the court from such order. In re Southern Pub. Utils.

                            The right of appeal conferred by former G.S. 62-20 was limited to a party to the proceeding. For purposes of appeal, those who had no property or proprietary rights which were or might be affected by orders of the Commission were not such parties. An

                            Municipality Entitled to Appeal. - It is the duty of a municipality granting a charter to a corporation to operate a streetcar system therein, which, by contract, has limited the fares to be charged passengers within a certain amount, to represent the
                            public in proceedings upon a petition filed by the railway company before the Commission requesting that it be permitted to raise the fares beyond those limited in the contract, and thus the municipality might appeal through
                            the courts as former G.S. 62-20 prescribed, when the order was adverse to it or the interest it represented, as a "party affected by the decision and determination of the Commission," expressly provided for by the statute.

                            Notice Mandatory. - Under former G.S. 62-20, the statutory notice of an appeal by a railroad company from an order of the Commission was mandatory, and could not be extended by the consent of the parties of record. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Southern

                            Notice to Complaining Party Under Former G.S. 62-20. - When notice of appeal to the superior court was given to the Commission by a railroad company, and other requirements of former G.S. 62-20 relating thereto were met by the company, this was sufficient,
                            without giving notice of the appeal to the complaining party in the proceedings had before the Commission, as upon this appeal the statute made the Commission the party plaintiff. State ex rel. N.C. Corp. Comm'n v. Southern

                            this would not transform the proceedings in which the order was made into "a suit at law or in equity," and, as such, removable from the superior court of the State to an inferior federal tribunal, upon the ground of diverse

                            In proceedings for the removal of a cause from the State to the federal courts upon the question of diversity of citizenship under the applicable federal statute, the State court is not bound to surrender its jurisdiction until a case has been made which,
                            on the face of the petition, shows the petitioner has a right to the transfer of the cause to the federal courts. State ex rel. N.C. Corp. Comm'n v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 447</cite>,

                            Final Process. - Under this Article as it stood before the 1949 revision, the Commission had no power to enforce its orders and decrees by final process issuing directly therefrom, and for such purpose resort had to be had to ordinary courts, either by
                            independent proceedings or in proper instances by process issued in cases carried before such courts on appeal. State ex rel. N.C. Corp. Comm'n v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 483</cite>,

                            Removal of Franchise Restriction as to Carriage of Passengers by Motor Carrier. - Former G.S. 62-20 authorized a petitioner to appeal to the superior court from an adverse ruling of the Utilities Commission on its petition for the removal from its franchise
                            of a restriction in regard to the carriage of passengers, and the contention that no appeal would lie from such order because the right of appeal was governed by the motor carrier laws authorizing an appeal from an order affecting
                            franchise only when entered for violation of law was untenable. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Scenic Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 325</cite>, 4 S.E.2d 897 (1939).

                            G.S. 62-133.6(e) simply allows the legislature to preempt the North Carolina Utilities Commission's ability to compel a general rate case by freezing rates until 31 December 2007; the North Carolina Utilities Commission properly dismissed a complaint
                            regarding rates and a petition to initiate a general rate proceeding filed against an energy corporation by a customers association. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers Ass'n,

                        <p>
                            Discretion of Utilities Commission. - In deciding complaints, the Utilities Commission is allowed discretion in fashioning a remedy; the Commission could transfer service of one cooperative to electric utility rather than all complainants, as long as
                            its action was not capricious or arbitrary. Dennis v. Duke Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 91</cite>, 459 S.E.2d 707 (1995).

                            Subsection (b) States Authority of Court. - The authority of the court to which an appeal is taken from an order of the Utilities Commission is stated in subsection (b) of this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,

                        <p>
                            Subsection (b) gives the Supreme Court ample basis for ordering refunds to ratepayers who have been charged unlawfully high rates. Therefore, the Supreme Court is authorized to order refunds when the Commission has made an error of law in its rate making
                            procedures. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Conservation Council, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 59</cite>, 320 S.E.2d 679 (1984).

                            Questions on appeal from the Commission must be determined from the record certified by it. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 384</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 689 (1964).

                            The Commission has the duty to enter final orders that are sufficient in detail to enable the Supreme Court on appeal to determine the controverted issues. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. AT &amp; T Communications of S. States, Inc.,

                            Unless Facts Are in Record, Commission's Expert Knowledge Cannot Be Considered. - The Commission's knowledge, however expert, cannot be considered by the Supreme Court on appeal unless the facts embraced within that knowledge are in the record. State

                            under this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 598</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 862 (1978).

                            Doctrine of Res Judicata. - Where an administrative determination has been reviewed by the courts, the res judicata effect, if any, attaches to the court's judgment rather than to the administrative decision. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Thornburg,
                            <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 463</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 451 (1989).

                            Adjustments to Cost Study. - North Carolina Utilities Commission did not err by approving a utility company's adjustments to a study of the costs of providing retail electric service to a large industrial customer because there was substantial evidence
                            in the record, including the testimony of three expert witnesses, to support the Commission's findings. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 430</cite>, 758 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            Standard that governs appellate review of Commission orders is statutorily articulated by subsections (b) and (c) of this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite>                            153, 363 S.E.2d 73 (1987).

                            Commission's Decision Will Be Upheld Unless Assailable Under Subsection (b). - The decision of the Commission with regard to rates for public utilities will be upheld by the Court of Appeals on appeal unless it is assailable on one of the grounds enumerated
                            in subsection (b) of this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Mebane Home Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 242 S.E.2d 165 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 162</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Judicial reversal of an order of the Utilities Commission is a serious matter for the reviewing court which can be properly addressed only by strict application of the six criteria of this section which circumscribe judicial review. State ex rel. Utils.

                        <p>
                            A decision of the Utilities Commission will be upheld on appeal unless the appellate court finds error based on one of the enumerated grounds of this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,

                        <p>
                            Absence of proper findings is an error of law and basis for remand under subdivision (b)(4) of this section because it frustrates appellate review. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Conservation Council, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C.

                            Scope of Review. - Grounds for relief not specifically set forth in the notice of appeal filed with the Commission may not be relied upon in the appellate courts; however, even when specific grounds are set forth, the applicable scope of review may be
                            determined only from an examination of the issues brought forward by the appealing party and the nature of the supporting contentions. Dennis v Duke Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite>                            272, 442 S.E.2d 104 (1994), modified, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 91</cite>, 459 S.E.2d 707 (1995).

                        <p>
                            In reviewing a decision of the Utilities Commission, the appellate court's role is to determine whether the entire record supports the Commission's decision, and where there are two reasonably conflicting views of the evidence, the appellate court may
                            not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Indus. Group For Fair Util. Rates, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 503 S.E.2d 697 (1998),

                        <p>
                            Test on Review. - The test applied by a reviewing court involves a determination of whether, after viewing the entire record, the Utilities Commission's findings and conclusions are supported by substantial, competent, and material evidence. State ex
                            rel. Utils. Comm'n v. North Carolina Gas Serv., <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 288, 494 S.E.2d 621 (1998).

                            The failure to include all the necessary findings of fact is an error of law and a basis for remand under subdivision (b)(4) of this section, because it frustrates appellate review. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Staff,
                            <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 26</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 898 (1986); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Staff-North Carolina Utils. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 689</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 567 (1988).

                        <p>
                            The Commission's order must be sufficient within itself to comply with the statute. Failure to include all necessary findings of fact and details is an error of law and a basis for remand under subdivision (b)(4) of this section, because it frustrates
                            appellate review. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. AT &amp; T Communications of S. States, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 586</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 386 (1988).

                        <p>
                            The Commission was required to make specific finds showing what effect, if any, it gave to financing costs or down market protection, or both, in arriving at its common equity rate of return decision. Failure to do so constituted an error of law requiring
                            a remand for further proceedings. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Staff-North Carolina Utils. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 689</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 567 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Function of Court on Review. - The Court of Appeals looks to the findings of fact and conclusions of the Commission and determines whether the Commission has considered the factors required by law and whether its findings are supported by competent, substantial
                            and material evidence in view of the whole record. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Springdale Estates Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 265 S.E.2d 647 (1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The test upon appeal from a determination of the Utilities Commission is whether the Commission's findings of fact are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Nantahala Power
                            &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 614</cite>, 332 S.E.2d 397, rev'd on other grounds, 476 U.S. 953, 106 S. Ct. 2349, 90 L. Ed. 2d 943 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Supreme Court's statutory function is not to determine whether there is evidence to support a position the Commission did not adopt. The court asks instead, whether there is substantial evidence, in view of the entire record, to support the position
                            which the Commission adopted. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Eddleman, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 344</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 339 (1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Appellate court's statutory function is to assess whether the North Carolina Utilities Commission's order is affected by errors of law and to determine whether there is substantial evidence, in view of the entire record, to support the position adopted.
                            State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 238</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 692 (1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The reviewing court should see if, in view of the entire record, the Utilities Commission's findings and conclusions are supported by substantial, competent and material evidence. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Piedmont Natural Gas Co.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 558</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 591 (1997).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Utilities Commission order issuing a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Convenience and Necessity to a utility to construct a transmission line along a proposed route was affirmed because under G.S. 62-94 and the standard of review,
                            the reviewing court could not weigh the credibility of the evidence and draw the ultimate conclusion; the Commission, after considering evidence from both the utility and the citizens who intervened to object to the proposed
                            route, concluded that the utility demonstrated that the proposed transmission line was necessary for an adequate and reliable supply of electric energy. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Wardlaw,
                            <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 634 S.E.2d 898 (2006).

                        <p>
                            Substantial Evidence Defined. - Substantial evidence is defined as "more than a scintilla or a permissible inference." It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.
                            Southern Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 597, 199 S.E.2d 731 (1973), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 623</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 693 (1974).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Commission may agree with single witness, if the evidence supports his position, no matter how many opposing witnesses might come forward. The court is then required to determine whether the Commission's decision is supported by competent, material and
                            substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Eddleman, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 344</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 339 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Evidence of Reasonableness of Practice. - Where the Commission's order required the defendants to do no more than they did voluntarily and without objection for 30 years or more, preceding the last six or eight years, this would seem to be "strong evidence"
                            of the reasonableness of the practice. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 359</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 510 (1962).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Findings, inferences, conclusions or decision of Utilities Commission which are arbitrary or capricious and which prejudice substantial rights of appellants are not binding on reviewing court. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Thornburg,
                            <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 509</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 772 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Subsection (c) requires the reviewing court to take due note of the rule of prejudicial error. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 671</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 681 (1974).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error in the consideration of an appeal. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Nello L. Teer Co., <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 366</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 511 (1966).

                        <p>
                            Standard Deemed Satisfied. - Where witnesses testified according to a private agreement that was not unanimous, the Utilities Commission was not subjected to a heightened standard of review but satisfied the requirements of this chapter by independently
                            considering and analyzing relevant evidence and facts presented by all the parties. State ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 223</cite>, 524
                            S.E.2d 10 (2000).

                        <p>
                            Substantial evidence supported the North Carolina Utilities Commission's approval of electric utilities' merger because ratepayers' benefits showed the merger met G.S. 62-111(a). In re Duke Energy Corp., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite>                            573, 755 S.E.2d 382 (2014).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Substantial evidence showed public benefits would result from a merger of electric utilities approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission because there were significant guaranteed fuel-cost savings and possible non-fuel-cost savings, as well as
                            commitments to support the community, job development, and low income energy assistance. In re Duke Energy Corp., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 755 S.E.2d 382 (2014).

                        <p>
                            Order of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, authorizing a percentage of return on equity for a utility company, was appropriate because the order contained sufficient findings of fact to demonstrate that the order was supported by competent, material,
                            and substantial evidence in view of the entire record. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 644</cite>, 766 S.E.2d 827 (2014).

                        <p>
                            North Carolina Utilities Commission's findings of fact demonstrated that the Commission considered the impact of changing economic conditions upon customers and specified how this influenced the Commission's decision to authorize a 10.2 percent return
                            on equity; the findings were supported by the evidence, including public witness testimony, expert testimony, and the parties' stipulation, and thus the Commission made sufficient findings regarding the impact of changing economic
                            conditions upon customers and these findings were supported by substantial evidence. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 741</cite>, 767 S.E.2d 305 (Jan. 23, 2015).

                        <p>
                            Record contained conflicting evidence concerning whether the use of the single coincident peak cost of service methodology was reasonable and fair to customers, and the Commission considered all the evidence presented, explained the weight given to the
                            evidence, and found that the methodology was reasonable; there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Commission's finding that the use of the methodology in question allocated costs equitably, and it was not
                            shown that the use of the methodology here resulted in unreasonable or unjust discrimination. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 741</cite>, 767 S.E.2d 305 (Jan.

                        <p>
                            Commission's findings were supported by substantial evidence, including the testimony of witnesses acknowledging that errors occurred and explaining that corrective steps were taken to resolve the errors, and it was not shown that the Commission allowed
                            the company to recover any improper costs from ratepayers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 741</cite>, 767 S.E.2d 305 (Jan. 23, 2015).

                            North Carolina Utilities Commission properly concluded it was in the public interest to allow a public utility to utilize a rate adjustment mechanism because its determination was supported by substantial evidence; the Commission thoroughly explained
                            how the utility's use of a rate adjustment mechanism would benefit its customers and took meaningful steps to ensure that problems were addressed and that customers were charged after the utility made improvements to its service.

                            Decision Not Supported by Substantial Evidence. - North Carolina Utilities Commission's (Commission) order approving a 10.5 percent return on common equity was not supported by substantial evidence under G.S. 62-94(b) and did not comply with G.S. 62-79(a)
                            where: (1) although the 10.5 percent return on common equity agreed to in a non-unanimous stipulation fell within the range of returns on common equity recommended by the witnesses, no witness specifically recommended an return
                            on common equity of 10.5 percent; (2) the Commission did not weigh any testimony presented, but merely recited the witnesses' testimony; (3) the Commission did not discuss why one witness's testimony was more credible than
                            another's or which methodology was afforded the greatest weight; (4) the Commission adopted the stipulated return on common equity wholesale, as opposed to considering it as one piece of evidence to be weighed in making an
                            otherwise independent determination based on the G.S. 62-133 factors; and (5) the Commission failed to make findings of fact regarding the impact of changing economic conditions on customers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                            Abuse of Commission's Discretion Found. - Decision of the North Carolina Utilities Commission to recognize a utility customers association and a customer as interveners in a settlement proceeding resulting from an investigation that was conducted, pursuant
                            to G.S. 62-37, of accounting irregularities in the way in which a utility reported its regulated income to the Commission was an abuse of the Commission's discretion; the association and the customer were not parties affected
                            by the Commission's order approving the settlement, within the meaning of G.S. 62-37, and as such had no standing to appeal the Commission's approval of the settlement agreement. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Util.

                            the Commission gave great weight to testimony concerning the state's unemployment rate, and certain costs were excluded from the rate base for one year in order to serve customer interests. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Cooper,

                            Even Though Reviewing Court Might Have Reached Different Conclusion. - Neither findings of fact nor the Commission's determination of what rates are reasonable may be reversed or modified by a reviewing court merely because the court would have reached
                            a different finding or determination upon the evidence. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 705 (1972); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                            If the rates are reasonable upon an application of the whole record test, the Court of Appeals is bound by the findings of fact establishing them and may not reach a different finding merely because it could have reached another determination upon the
                            evidence. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Springdale Estates Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 265 S.E.2d 647 (1980).

                            by a reviewing court merely because the court's subjective judgment is different from that of the Commission, nor is the Commission required to accept as conclusive the subjective judgment of a witness, even though the record
                            contains no expression of a contrary opinion by another witness. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 428, 225 S.E.2d 101, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 424</cite>,

                            The authority to determine the adequacy of a utility's service and the rates to be charged lies with the Commission, and a reviewing court may not modify or reverse its determination merely because the court would have reached a different finding based
                            on the evidence. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Staff-North Carolina Utils. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 26</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 898 (1986); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Staff-North

                            Finding Held Error of Law. - Finding of the Commission that legal fees which were incurred by utility in contesting the amount of an administrative penalty imposed as a result of its failure to provide adequate water service were recoverable as part of
                            its operating expenses, in that they were "a reasonable and necessary expenditure" which was associated with its water service to its customers, constituted an error of law under subdivision (b)(4) of this section. State ex

                            Findings Concerning Company's Debt Ratio. - Conclusion of the Utilities Commission that a natural gas company's capital structure should include a short-term debt ratio of 4.02%, based on a short-term debt equal to stored gas inventory rather than "the
                            daily average balance amount of short-term debt for the most recent twelve month period," was supported by substantial evidence. State ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers Ass'n,

                            Determination by Commission Is Prima Facie Just and Reasonable. - A determination by the Commission is not simply prima facie evidence of its validity, but is prima facie just and reasonable. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Ray,
                            <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 692</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 870 (1953); State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Municipal Corps., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 193</cite>, 90 S.E.2d 519 (1955); State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Casey,

                            The Commission, not the reviewing court, is to make determination of fair value of the properties. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 308</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 95 (1972).

                        <p>
                            While the Commission has the duty to weigh evidences of "fair value" fairly and in "balanced scales," the reviewing court may not set aside the Commission's determination of "fair value" merely because the court would have given the respective elements
                            different weights and would, therefore, have arrived at a different "fair value." State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 189
                            S.E.2d 777 (1972).

                        <p>
                            The Supreme Court may not reverse an order of the Commission because of its weighting of the respective indicators of "fair value," unless it finds such weighting to have been arbitrary and lacking support in the evidence, in view of the entire record,
                            or otherwise affected by error of law. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. VEPCO, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 398</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 283 (1974).

                            The question of whether a case "is to be a general rate case" under the terms of G.S. 62-137 is a mixed question of law and fact. As to such questions, courts should be hesitant to disturb the Commission's expert determination with regard to the nature
                            of the case presented, particularly when its determination is made prior to hearing and for the initial purpose of setting the scope of the hearing and the resulting amount of information which the public utility will be required
                            to furnish. Even at that stage, however, the Commission's determination must be supported by "competent, material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted." State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Rail Common

                            What constitutes public convenience and necessity is primarily an administrative question with a number of imponderables to be taken into consideration, e.g., whether there is a substantial public need for the service, whether the existing carriers can
                            reasonably meet this need, and whether the service would endanger or impair the operations of existing carriers contrary to the public interest. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co.,

                            to try and determine both issues of law and issues of fact, duly presented by assignments of error based upon exceptions duly taken by the appellant during the hearing before the Commission. The trial of such issues by the

                            Appeals from the Utilities Commissioner were analogous to appeals from a justice of the peace rather than appeals from a referee; hence, since the trial in the superior court was de novo upon issues of fact raised by the exceptions, the superior court
                            properly refused to pass upon appellant's exceptions to the findings of fact seriatim. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Scenic Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 233</cite>, 10 S.E.2d

                            Decision of Commission "Prima Facie Just and Reasonable". - While on appeal from the Utilities Commission to the superior court the provision of former G.S. 62-21 was interpreted to mean that the trial should be de novo, the section also provided that
                            the decision or determination of the Commission "shall be prima facie just and reasonable." State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Great S. Trucking Co., <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 687</cite>, 28 S.E.2d

                            What Evidence Admissible. - On appeal from an order of the Commission under former G.S. 62-21 the trial was de novo, tried under the same rules and regulations as are prescribed for the trial of other civil causes; and any relevant evidence could be there
                            introduced, whether it had theretofore been introduced before the Commission or not. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 270</cite>, 76 S.E. 554 (1912).

                            would have on property values in a nearby town where the present station of one of the roads was located. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 270</cite>,

                            of the decision of the Commission. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 390</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 328 (1944).

                    <p>
                        Relationship With Other Laws. - There was no conflict between G.S. 62-106 and G.S. 62-42 because they served different purposes and were reconcilable; the provisions of G.S. 62-100 through G.S. 62-107 dealt with the siting of certain large transmission
                        lines and were not applicable to the case, and G.S. 62-42 was much broader in scope, dealing with compelling any type of needed improvement to a public utility system. The siting of lines of at least 161 kV was often controversial
                        and the legislature's decision to require specialized procedures for the siting of these lines was logical. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Town of Kill Devil Hills, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite>                        561, 670 S.E.2d 341 (2009), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 739</cite>, 686 S.E.2d 151 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Issuance of Certificate. - Utilities Commission order issuing a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Convenience and Necessity to a utility to construct a transmission line along a proposed route was affirmed because, under G.S. 62-94
                        and the standard of review, the reviewing court could not weigh the credibility of the evidence and draw the ultimate conclusion; further, the Commission did not improperly shift the burden of proof to the citizens rather than
                        to the utility under G.S. 62-105(a). State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Wardlaw, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 634 S.E.2d 898 (2006).

                        Burden of Proof. - Utilities Commission order issuing a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Convenience and Necessity to a utility to construct a transmission line along a proposed route was affirmed because the Commission did not improperly
                        shift the burden of proof to the citizens rather than to the utility under G.S. 62-105(a); the Commission properly assigned to the utility the initial burden of proving it had examined alternative routes and that its preferred
                        route was reasonable and in the public interest. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Wardlaw, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 634 S.E.2d 898 (2006).

                    Within 30 days after receipt of notice of an application as provided by G.S. 62-102, a municipality or county shall file with the Commission and serve on the applicant the provisions of an ordinance that may affect the construction, operation, or maintenance
                    of the proposed transmission line in the manner provided by the rules of the Commission. If the municipality or county does not serve notice as provided above of any such ordinance provisions, the provisions of such ordinance may not
                    be enforced by the municipality or county. If the applicant proposes not to comply with any part of the ordinance, the applicant may move the Commission for an order preempting that part of the ordinance. Service of the motion on the
                    municipality or county by the applicant shall make the municipality or county a party to the proceeding. If the Commission finds that the greater public interest requires it, the Commission may include in a certificate issued under
                    this Article an order preempting any part of such county or municipal ordinance with respect to the construction, operation or maintenance of the proposed transmission line.

                        Relationship With Other Laws. - There was no conflict between G.S. 62-106 and G.S. 62-42 because they served different purposes and were reconcilable; the provisions of G.S. 62-100 through G.S. 62-107 dealt with the siting of certain large transmission
                        lines and were not applicable to the case, and G.S. 62-42 was much broader in scope, dealing with compelling any type of needed improvement to a public utility system. The siting of lines of at least 161 kV was often controversial
                        and the legislature's decision to require specialized procedures for the siting of these lines was logical. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                        are provided are connected, and provided further that any certificated local provider or any other provider authorized by the Commission may provide access lines or trunks connecting such authorized service to the telephone network,
                        and that the local service rates permitted or approved by the Commission for local exchange lines or trunks being shared or resold shall be on a measured usage basis where facilities are available or on a message rate basis otherwise.
                        Provided however, the Commission may permit or approve flat rates, measured rates, message rates, or some combination of those rates for shared or resold services whenever the service is offered to patrons of hotels or motels,
                        occupants of timeshare or condominium complexes serving primarily transient occupants, to patrons of hospitals, nursing homes, rest homes, or licensed retirement centers, or to members of clubs or students living in quarters furnished
                        by educational institutions, or to persons temporarily subleasing residential premises. The Commission shall issue rules to implement the service authorized by this subsection, considering the competitive nature of the offerings
                        and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission shall determine the extent to which such services shall be regulated and, to the extent necessary to protect the public interest, regulate the terms, conditions, and
                        rates charged for such services and the terms and conditions for interconnection to the local exchange network. The Commission shall require any person offering telephone service under this subsection by means of a Private Branch
                        Exchange ("PBX") or key system to secure adequate local exchange trunks from any certificated local provider or any other provider authorized by the Commission so as to assure a quality of service equal to the quality of service
                        generally found acceptable by the Commission. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission for good cause shown by the company, the right and obligation of the certificated local provider or any other provider authorized by the Commission
                        to provide local service directly to any person located within its certificated service area shall continue to apply to premises where shared or resold telephone service is available, provided however, the Commission shall be authorized
                        to establish the terms and conditions under which such services should be provided.

                    or telecommunications service provider with carrier of last resort responsibility may satisfy its carrier of last resort obligation by using any available technology. In continuing this State's commitment to universal service, the
                    Commission shall, by December 31, 1996, adopt interim rules that designate the person that should be the universal service provider and to determine whether universal service should be funded through interconnection rates or through
                    some other funding mechanism. At a time determined by the Commission to be in the public interest, the Commission shall conduct an investigation for the purpose of adopting final rules concerning the provision of universal services,
                    and whether universal service should be funded through interconnection rates or through some other funding mechanism, and, consistent with the provisions of subsections (f4) and (f5) of this section, the person that should be the universal
                    service provider. A local exchange company that has elected to be subject to alternative regulation under G.S. 62-133.5(m) does not have any carrier of last resort obligations.

                            The basis for the requirement of a certificate of public convenience and necessity, as a prerequisite to the right to serve, is the adoption, by the General Assembly, of the policy that, nothing else appearing, the public is better served by a regulated
                            monopoly than by competing suppliers of the service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 257</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 100 (1966); State ex rel. Utils.

                            Requirement Curtails Competition. - Regarding public utilities, competition, deemed unnecessary, is curtailed by the requirement that one desiring to engage in such business procure from the Utilities Commission a certificate of public convenience and
                            necessity. In re Certificate of Need for Aston Park Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 542</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 729 (1973).

                        <p>
                            By this section the State has granted to the utility company a legal monopoly upon a service vital to the economic well-being and the domestic life of the people of a large territory. This franchise is a property right of great value. Normally, when the
                            grantee sells its business to another company, the monopolistic franchise command a substantial price, over and above the exchange value of the physical properties transferred with it. Thus, the value of the franchise enters
                            into and affects the market price of the utility's stock. It does not, however, enter into the computation of the utility's rate base. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>,

                            Standing to Contest Application for Certificate. - Plaintiff utilities which, by virtue of their contiguity to subdivision were in a superior position to any other utility in the area to provide service to the development since no other competitor would
                            be able to provide for subdivision without first obtaining a certificate, and in the event that another company sought a certificate, plaintiffs would be afforded the opportunity to contest the application, had a legitimate
                            expectation of entitlement sufficient to give them a protectible interest so as to challenge city's provision of water to the subdivision. Quality Water Supply, Inc. v. City of Wilmington,

                            Access Charge Tariff Within Authority of Commission. - Considering the evidence supporting the view that access charge tariff was calculated to reimburse local exchange companies (LECs) for having to provide additional connection facilities to local networks,
                            payments could not be viewed as mere increased revenues for the LECs, but to provide funds to set off those expenditures that the LECs were required to make to provide additional facilities to handle additional carrier access.
                            The imposition of the access charge tariff was within the authority granted to the Commission by the 1984 amendments to this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,

                            Plan for Compensation to Local Exchange Companies for Lost Revenues During Transition - Not Invalid. - Plan requiring compensation to local exchange companies for lost revenues during transition period did not violate the equal protection clause or the

                            Same - Not a Penalty or Damages. - Plan requiring compensation to local exchange companies for lost revenues during transition period did not impose a "penalty" or constitute money damages, and could more appropriately be considered as a prerequisite
                            to receiving a certificate. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 153, 363 S.E.2d 73 (1987).

                            of certification which was consistent with the public interest. The plan was therefore statutorily authorized. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel.

                            The status of an entity as a public utility, entitled to the rights conferred by statute and subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, does not depend upon whether it has secured a certificate of public convenience and necessity, pursuant to this
                            section, but is determined instead according to whether it is, in fact, operating a business defined by the legislature as a public utility. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                            that the proposed service is necessary in the sense of being indispensable. Nevertheless, a mere showing of convenience is not sufficient. There must be an element of public need for the proposed service by the applicant in

                            to support both a well and septic system, and that the occupants of these residences, who were currently among appellant's customers, had no alternative means of water supply or sewage disposal other than the service provided
                            by appellant, clearly supported the conclusion not only that appellant's services constituted a convenience to that segment of the public who used them, but also that such services were necessary to the safety and health of

                            A certificate of public convenience and necessity, which authorizes its holder to render "telephone service" does not limit the holder to the practice of the art of telephony as it was known and practiced on the date the certificate was issued, nor to
                            the use therein of devices, equipment and methods then in use. Obviously, it is the intent of such a certificate to authorize the holder to improve its service by adopting and using new and improved devices and methods for

                            Order Held Not to Create a Vested Property Right to Provide Service. - The order of the Commission relating to the provision of intraLATA service by MCI via its own facilities after January 1, 1987, did not give MCI a vested property right of which it
                            was unconstitutionally deprived by the Commission's failure to allow facilities-based intraLATA competition on January 1, 1987. Before MCI could have the right to provide intraLATA service via its own facilities, the Commission
                            would have to issue a certificate of authority to MCI, and the Commission could not issue this certificate without making the requisite findings of fact pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                            in this requirement the concept that, once a certificate is granted which authorizes the holder to render the proposed service within the geographic area in question, a certificate will not be granted to a competitor in the
                            absence of a showing that the utility already in the field is not rendering and cannot or will not render the specific service in question. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,

                            a mobile radio service, the Utilities Commission should have denied an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to an applicant who proposed to render substantially the same mobile radio service in
                            the area; the fact that the applicant proposed to offer an electronic personal paging service as an auxiliary to its mobile radio service was not a sufficient difference to justify the issuance of the certificate, when it appeared

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 2009-390, s. 1(a), provides: "The General Assembly makes the following findings:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) In 2002, North Carolina enacted S.L. 2002-4, the Clean Smokestacks Act, with the goal of improving air quality in the State.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) With the enactment of the Clean Smokestacks Act, North Carolina became a national leader in multipollutant air emissions reduction strategies and has experienced significant reductions in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), and, as
                    a co-benefit, mercury.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) Duke Energy and Progress Energy, the investor-owned public utilities governed by the Clean Smokestacks Act, actively participated in the negotiations that led to the enactment of the Clean Smokestacks Act and recommended substantial emissions reductions
                    requirements and an aggressive timeline for achieving compliance with those requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Both Duke Energy and Progress Energy have produced emissions reductions greater than and sooner than required by the Clean Smokestacks Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) The retirement of coal-fired generating units and installation of generating units that use natural gas as the primary fuel will reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) more than would the installation of sulfur dioxide
                    (SO2) emissions controls on the coal-fired generating units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) The retirement of coal-fired generating units and installation of generating units that use natural gas as the primary fuel will reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and mercury (Hg) significantly more than would the installation of sulfur dioxide
                    (SO2) emissions controls on the coal-fired generating units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) The retirement of coal-fired generating units that are owned and operated by Progress Energy and located in eastern North Carolina and the installation of generating units that use natural gas as their primary fuel to replace them will reduce emissions
                    of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and mercury (Hg) more than would the installation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions controls on the older coal-fired generating units."

                    <p>
                        This section was enacted to help curb overexpansion of generating facilities beyond the needs of the service area. To this end, the General Assembly used the term "public convenience and necessity" to define the standard to be applied by the Utilities
                        Commission to proposed facilities. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. High Rock Lake Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 245 S.E.2d 787, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 646</cite>,

                    <p>
                        The purpose of requiring a certificate of public convenience and necessity before a generating facility can be built is to prevent costly overbuilding. Environmental concerns were generally left to other regulatory agencies, except as they affect the
                        cost and efficiency of the proposed generating facility. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. High Rock Lake Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 245 S.E.2d 787, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 646</cite>,

                        Advance Certification of Facilities in Other States Not Contemplated. - This section does not appear to contemplate advance certification by the North Carolina Utils. Commission of facilities built in other states. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Eddleman,
                        <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 344</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 339 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Public convenience and necessity is based on an element of public need for the proposed service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. High Rock Lake Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 245 S.E.2d 787, cert. denied,

                    <p>
                        Subdivision (b)(1) of G.S. 62-133 does not require the Commission to make new findings on the need for the construction. Before any public utility begins the construction of a facility for generating electricity for use by the public it must first obtain
                        from the Commission a certificate stating that public convenience and necessity requires, or will require such construction. Before such a certificate can be granted the applicant must file an estimate of construction costs and
                        the Commission must hold public hearings. This procedure satisfies the argument that the construction must be necessary. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Conservation Council, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 59</cite>,
                        320 S.E.2d 679 (1984).

                    <p>
                        Subsection (c) of this section makes it clear that the only purpose of a least-cost planning proceeding is to assist the Utilities Commission in developing, publicizing, and keeping current an analysis of the long-range needs for expansion of facilities
                        for the generation of electricity in North Carolina. Nowhere is it suggested in subsection (c) that the purpose of the proceeding is to issue directives which fundamentally alter a given utility's operations. State ex rel. Utils.

                        Scope of Commission's Authority and Jurisdiction. - North Carolina Utilities Commission's dismissal of petitioner independent power producer's application and its establishment of minimum filing requirements did not constitute an impermissible deviation
                        from the process specifically provided in this section and G.S. 62-82, and some deviation from these sections was not beyond the Commission's authority and jurisdiction. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Empire Power Co.,

                        Because the North Carolina Utilities Commission had authority to conduct a pre-sale review of proposed contracts involving sales of electricity by a utility to wholesale customers in interstate commerce under G.S. 62-110.1(a), (c), (d), its actions were
                        not preempted by 16 U.S.C.S.

                        Inclusion of Facility in Another State Absent North Carolina Certificate of Necessity. - The Commission acted within the limits of its authority when it included Catawba Unit 1, located in South Carolina, in power company's rate base, even though no North
                        Carolina certificate of necessity had been obtained prior to beginning construction thereof. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Eddleman, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 344</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 339 (1987).

                            Purpose. - One of the purposes of this Chapter is to vest the Utilities Commission with authority and responsibility to assign territory to electric suppliers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Union Elec. Membership Corp.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 309, 164 S.E.2d 889 (1968).

                        <p>
                            Another purpose of this Chapter, and particularly subsection (b) of this section, is to declare certain rights of electric suppliers in areas outside of municipalities pending the assignment of territory. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Union Elec. Membership
                            Corp., <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 309, 164 S.E.2d 889 (1968).

                        <p>
                            A principal purpose of this section is to provide an orderly method for allocation of service areas as among competing suppliers of electricity and thereby to eliminate unnecessary duplication of electric line facilities. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.
                            Lumbee River Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 164 S.E.2d 895 (1968), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 250</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 663 (1969).

                        <p>
                            The overriding purpose of this section is to promote the public interest, not the business of the electric membership cooperative or that of the investor-owned utility. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Woodstock Elec. Membership Corp.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 108</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 406 (1970).

                        <p>
                            The former absence of statutory provisions restricting competition between electric membership corporations and public utility suppliers of electric power gave rise to many contracts between these two types of suppliers designed to fix their respective
                            territorial rights, which contracts, in turn, gave rise to much litigation. In the hope of putting an end to or reducing this turmoil, the 1965 legislature enacted this section, the language of which was the result of collaboration
                            and agreement between the two types of suppliers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Woodstock Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 108</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 406 (1970).

                            The clear purpose of Session Laws 1965, c. 287, is to prevent wasteful duplication of competing facilities, and thereby serve the public interest. Domestic Elec.

                            The Territorial Assignment Act of 1965, as codified at this section and G.S. 160A-331 through 160A-338, represents an attempt to eliminate the uneconomic duplication of transmission and distribution systems bred of unbridled competition between public
                            utilities, electric membership corporations and municipalities by designating the various competitors' rights. Morgan v. Town of Hertford, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 725, 321 S.E.2d

                            Discretion of Utilities Commission. - In deciding complaints, the Utilities Commission is allowed discretion in fashioning a remedy; the Commission could transfer only service of one cooperative to electric utility rather than all complainants, as long
                            as its action was not capricious or arbitrary. Dennis v. Duke Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 91</cite>, 459 S.E.2d 707 (1995).

                            Prior to the enactment of this section in 1965, there was no restraint upon competition in rural areas between electric membership corporations and public utility suppliers of electric power, except as established by contract. State ex rel. Utils. Lumbee

                            Prior to enactment of this section, electric membership cooperatives and investor-owned public utility companies were free to compete in the rural portions of this State, in the absence of contractual restrictions upon such right, irrespective of the

                            lines by assigning territories to specific suppliers of electricity. Domestic Elec. Serv., Inc. v. City of Rocky Mount, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 347, 201 S.E.2d 508, aff'd on other

                            Legislature Determines What Policy Is in Public Interest. - It is for the legislature, not for the Supreme Court or the Utilities Commission, to determine whether the policy of free competition between the suppliers of electric power, or the policy of
                            territorial monopoly, or an intermediate policy is in the public interest. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Lumbee River Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 250</cite>, 166 S.E.2d

                            and the right to serve "premises" initially requiring service after that date, located within 300 feet of a line of such supplier and not in a territory assigned by the Utilities Commission to a different supplier pursuant

                            Construction. - Where provisions of this section relating to assignment of electric service territory in rural areas are clear and understandable on their face, the Supreme Court is not required to construe this statute in connection with other provisions
                            of this Chapter relating to powers of the Utilities Commission to regulate public utilities. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Lumbee River Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 250</cite>,

                            Subsection (c) contemplates the assignment of a territory to a single supplier for all classes of users of electric power, nothing else appearing. However, the statutory direction that the Commission assign service areas "by adequately defined boundaries"
                            does not compel the conclusions that the intent of the legislature was to require the Commission to choose between (1) jeopardizing the industrial development of a geographic area by assigning it exclusively to an electric
                            membership cooperative, or (2) boxing the cooperative into the narrow strips bordering its existing lines by assigning the territory outside those strips to an investor-owned utility for all types of electric service. State

                            One Area May Be Assigned Jointly to Two Electric Suppliers. - The Utilities Commission did not exceed its authority under this section in assigning the same areas jointly to two electric suppliers, subject to consumers reasonable choice of supplier, since
                            under appropriate circumstances and appropriate findings by the Commission, public convenience and necessity may require such an assignment. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Woodstock Elec. Membership Corp.,

                            of demand and to another supplier for service above that level of demand. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Woodstock Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 108</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 406

                            dividing the geographic area into two service areas on the basis of the users' demand levels, to permit, on the basis of public convenience and necessity, an electric membership cooperative, to which the area of the smaller
                            demands has been assigned, to serve a user whose demand is above the division line, if that user desires to become a member of the cooperative and thus to use its service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Woodstock Elec. Membership

                            Considerations in Assigning Areas to Electric Suppliers. - Subsection (c) of this section declares the purpose for which the authority to assign "areas" is conferred upon the Commission. That purpose is "to avoid unnecessary duplication of electric facilities."
                            To accomplish this objective, the statute directs the Commission to make assignments "in accordance with public convenience and necessity." In determining whether an assignment is in accord with "public convenience and necessity,"
                            the Commission is directed to consider the "adequacy and dependability of the service of electric suppliers." It is also directed to consider "other things." State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Woodstock Elec. Membership Corp.,

                            In assigning rural service areas to electric suppliers pursuant to this section, the Utilities Commission may consider, in addition to development of natural resources and employment opportunities, (1) the past history of service to residential, agricultural,
                            and small commercial users in adjacent territories, (2) the capital required for supplying electric power to large users in the territory and the past experience of a supplier in serving such users, and (3) the demonstrated
                            preference of a substantial class of potential users for one supplier over another. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Woodstock Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 108</cite>, 171

                            The attraction of industry to a sparsely settled rural territory, which will develop its natural resources and provide opportunity of employment to its residents, is one of the "other things" to be considered by the Commission in determining what assignment
                            of territory to electrical suppliers will be in accord with public convenience and necessity. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Woodstock Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 108</cite>,

                            Right to Serve Not Exclusive. - While an electric supplier has the right to serve all premises in its assigned area, the mere grant of a right to serve is not the grant of an exclusive right to do so. Domestic Elec. Serv., Inc. v. City of Rocky Mount,
                            <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 135</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 838 (1974).

                        Showing of Public Need Not Required. - The showing of public need which G.S. 62-262(e)(1) requires of an application for a new authority is not applicable in a transfer proceeding under this section and was not written into it by subsection (a) of this
                        section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Associated Petro. Carriers, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 173 S.E.2d 25 (1970).

                    <p>
                        Subsection (e) of this section does not indicate a policy change toward protecting existing certificate holders from lawful competition. Moreover, like the test of "public convenience and necessity" in subsection (a), the requirement that the Commission
                        find the transfer "in the public interest" does not write into the transfer approval procedure the new certificate test of public need required by G.S. 62-262(e)(1). State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Associated Petro. Carriers,
                        <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 173 S.E.2d 25 (1970).

                        Where the issue of dormancy under G.S. 62-112(c) has been raised, if the Commission finds that the franchise is not dormant, it must then determine if the criteria required by this section for approval of the transfer have been met. If the Commission
                        finds that the franchise is dormant under G.S. 62-112(c), the application for transfer must be denied, because approval would in effect constitute the granting of a new franchise without satisfying the new authority test and other
                        requirements of G.S. 62-262(e). State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Estes Express Lines, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 234 S.E.2d 624 (1977).

                    <p>
                        Test for "Public Convenience and Necessity". - The requirement of "public convenience and necessity" referred to in subsection (a) of this section is satisfied by a showing that the authority has been and is being actively applied in satisfaction of the
                        public need which was shown to exist when the authority was originally acquired. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Associated Petro. Carriers, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 173 S.E.2d 25 (1970).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The criteria "if justified by the public convenience and necessity" in subsection (a) of this section has been interpreted as a statutory basis for the test of dormancy. Where the authority has been abandoned or "dormant," the Commission has denied applications
                        for transfer because approval would in effect be the granting of a new authority without satisfying the new authority test of public need set out in G.S. 62-262(e). Where the authority has been actively operated, the applicants
                        for sale and transfer of motor freight carrier rights are under no burden to show through shipper witnesses that a demand and need exist. The rationale is that public convenience and necessity was shown to exist when the authority
                        was granted or acquired, and the rebuttable presumption of law is that it continues. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Associated Petro. Carriers, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 173 S.E.2d 25

                        Merger of electric utilities approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission (Commission) was not contrary to public convenience and necessity because (1) testimony and G.S 62-133.8(b) and G.S. 62-133.9(b) supported the Commission's monopsony analysis,
                        (2) the Commission considered job losses, and (3) low-income families were not harmed. In re Duke Energy Corp., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 755 S.E.2d 382 (2014).

                        Public Convenience and Necessity for Proposed Transfers of Water and Sewer Franchises. - When the commission is adjudging public convenience and necessity in the context of proposed transfers of water and sewer franchises under subsection (a) of this
                        section, it must inquire into all aspects of anticipated service and rates occasioned and engendered by the proposed transfer, and then determine whether the transfer will serve the public convenience and necessity. State ex rel.

                        Utility commission did not err in approving acquisition of utility's certificate of public convenience and necessity, denying inclusion of acquired utility's purchase price in the base rate, and reducing connection fees. In re Petition of Utils., Inc.,

                    <p>
                        State Policy Favors Transfers of Actively Operated Motor Freight Carrier Certificates. - The policy of the State, as declared in the Public Utilities Act of 1963, clearly favors transfers of actively operated motor freight carrier certificates without
                        unreasonable restraint. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Associated Petro. Carriers, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 173 S.E.2d 25 (1970); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Estes Express Lines,

                        Transfer to a More Competitive Carrier Not Prohibited. - The possibility that a transfer of authority to a more competitive carrier will adversely affect existing carriers does not make such a transfer contrary to the public interest as a matter of law.

                        Requirement of subsection (e) of this section that the Commission find that the proposed transfer "will not adversely affect the service to the public under said franchise" is satisfied by a determination that the proposed transferee of the franchise
                        is capable of rendering service equal to that of the proposed transferor, and does not prohibit approval where transfer of the franchise to a more competitive hauler would have an adverse effect on existing carriers. State ex rel.

                        employees of the seller, (3) unremitted C.O.D. collections due seller, (4) "for loss or damage of goods transported or received for transportation," (5) overcharge on property transported, and (6) for interline accounts to other
                        carriers. American Nat'l Fire Ins. Co. v. Gibbs, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 681</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 669 (1963), decided under this section as it stood prior to the 1963 amendment.

                        Question of Whether Purchaser of Water or Sewer Franchise Can Provide Better Service. - The question of whether another potential purchaser of a water or sewer franchise can provide better service is plainly relevant under the broad public convenience
                        and necessity test of subsection (a) of this section. But such a showing would not of itself be dispositive of the issue of whether approval should be granted. When weighing the broad aspects and implications of public convenience
                        and necessity, the Commission is cloaked with wide discretion and is not required to reject an application for transfer merely because another potential purchaser produces evidence that it might be able to do a better job. State

                        Transfers of Utility Franchises Cannot Be Made Contingent upon Commission Approval. - Lawful transfers of ownership and control of utility franchises cannot be made contingent upon or subject to commission approval; however, in emergency situations, the
                        Commission can issue temporary or interim orders giving conditional or temporary approval of operational control. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                        This section does not permit the completion of transfers contingent upon or subject to Commission approval; the legislature, by the unambiguous terms of the statute, clearly intended to prohibit de facto transfers of franchises before the Commission has
                        had the opportunity to pass upon the merits of the transfer under the public convenience and necessity test. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                        Certificate Holder Not Released from Liability for Nonperformance of Duties. - This section does not confer upon the Utilities Commission the power to release the holder of a certificate of convenience and necessity from liability for the nonperformance
                        of public duties incident to the certificate, and the Commission possesses no such power in the absence of a delegation thereof by the legislature. Hough-Wylie Co. v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 90</cite>,

                        incident to operation, and a shipper may hold lessor liable for lessee's failure to make prompt remittance of C.O.D. collections as required by G.S. 62-273. Hough-Wylie Co. v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 90</cite>,

                        Right to Combine Purchased Route Authority and Original Route Authority of Purchasing Carrier. - Where an irregular carrier acquired the certificate of another irregular carrier with the authority of the Utilities Commission, the purchasing carrier had
                        the legal right to combine or "tack" the irregular route authority purchased by it and its original irregular route authority, as there were no conditions or restrictions imposed by statute or any rule or regulation of the Commission

                        supported by substantial evidence, to the effect that the franchise carrier did not in fact obtain its franchise for the purpose of transferring it to another obviated the application of subsection (d) of this section. State ex

                        Subsection (e) Operates as Separate Test. - The plain language of subsection (e) of this section unambiguously indicates the intent of the legislature for that section to operate as a separate and distinct test, applying only to transfers of motor carrier
                        franchises; that the broader public convenience and necessity test necessarily subsumes under it some of the same elements does not alter this fact. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Village of Pinehurst,

                        supported by evidence, that the franchise carrier was conducting active operations under the franchise and that its ability to render service to the public within the limits of its franchise rights would not be adversely affected
                        by the proposed transfer of its stock supported conclusion that the proposed sale of its stock was justified by the public convenience and necessity within the meaning of this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach

                        is dormant and the public convenience and necessity is no longer served by such common carrier certificate. Upon finding after notice and hearing that no such service has been performed for a period of 30 days the Commission is
                        authorized to find that the franchise is dormant and to cancel the certificate of such common carrier. The Commission in its discretion may give consideration in such finding to other factors affecting the performance of such service,

                        or any other carrier. The franchise of a motor carrier may be canceled under the provisions of this section in any proceeding to sell or transfer or otherwise change control of said franchise brought under the provisions of G.S.

                        Evidence Justifying a Finding of Dormancy. - Under subsection (c) the failure to perform any transportation for compensation under the authority of the franchise for a period of 30 days is prima facie evidence that the franchise is dormant. Such evidence
                        is sufficient to justify but not to compel a finding that the franchise is dormant. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Estes Express Lines, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 234 S.E.2d 624 (1977).

                        Upon a prima facie showing of dormancy under subsection (c) the Commission in its discretion may then consider other factors affecting the performance of such services, the subsection listing factors which may be considered. If the Commission in its discretion
                        considers other factors, it may find that the evidence relating to one or more of these factors rebuts the prima facie evidence of dormancy and that the franchise is not dormant. And if the evidence relating to one or more of these
                        factors, as found by the Commission, is competent, material and substantial, the finding will not be disturbed on appeal under G.S. 62-94(b)(5). State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Estes Express Lines,

                        Evidence Sufficient to Rebut Dormancy Case. - Evidence that transferor continuously advertised its services, that it was ready, willing and able to haul both exempt and nonexempt commodities under its franchise, and that it charged published tariff rates
                        in hauling both exempt and nonexempt commodities, was competent, material and substantial, and was sufficient to rebut the prima facie evidence of dormancy and to support the consideration by the Commission of one or more of the
                        "other factors" listed in subsection (c). State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Estes Express Lines, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 234 S.E.2d 624 (1977).

                    <p>
                        Effect on Transfer of Dormancy Finding. - Where the issue of dormancy under subsection (c) has been raised, if the Commission finds that the franchise is not dormant, it must then determine if the criteria required by G.S. 62-111 for approval of the transfer
                        have been met. If the Commission finds that the franchise is dormant under subsection (c), the application for transfer must be denied, because approval would in effect constitute the granting of a new franchise without satisfying
                        the new authority test and other requirements of G.S. 62-262(e). State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Estes Express Lines, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 234 S.E.2d 624 (1977).

                        The amount of capital to be advanced by each customer shall be subject to approval by the Commission, and shall be advanced under such conditions as will enable each customer to retain a proprietary interest in the system to the
                        extent of the capital so advanced. The remedy prescribed in this subsection is in addition to other remedies prescribed by law.

                        Paramount Right of State to Regulate Public Utilities. - The power of a municipality to grant franchises to public utilities for the use of its streets and to provide service to its citizens must yield to the paramount right of the State to regulate public
                        utilities through the Utilities Commission, even when they are operated within the corporate boundaries of a municipality. Duke Power Co. v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite>                        91, 205 S.E.2d 774, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 661</cite>, 207 S.E.2d 752 (1974).

                        Utility Owes Duty of Continuous Operation. - While a public utility retains its franchise, it owes to the State and the public the duty of continuous operation. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Haywood Elec. Membership Corp.,

                        Consent of Customer or Commission Necessary Before Abandonment of Service. - A power company may not abandon service to any customer, subject to the customer's paying his bill, without the consent of the customer or authorization of the Utilities Commission.

                        Customer Entitled to Restoration of Service Absent Contrary Order. - Where a power company discontinued its service for nonpayment of charges, the customer, upon payment of the charges, was entitled to restoration of the service where the company did
                        not obtain an order from the Commission. Sweetheart Lake, Inc. v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 269</cite>, 189 S.E. 785 (1937).

                        Discretionary Power of Commission to Authorize Discontinuance. - The General Assembly intended that the Utilities Commission exercise the power conferred upon it to authorize a discontinuance of an established service in large measure according to its
                        judgment and discretion. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 73</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 21 (1961).

                    <p>
                        The power of the Commission to authorize an abandonment of service is, in large measure, discretionary. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Mackie, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 338 S.E.2d 888 (1986), modified and aff'd,

                        The Commission's power to require a utility to continue a service is not unlimited. To require a utility, particularly a small operation, to continue an unprofitable operation would violate constitutional guarantees against the taking of property without
                        just compensation. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Mackie, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 338 S.E.2d 888 (1986), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 686</cite>, 351 S.E.2d 289

                        Propriety of Order Requiring Continued Operation. - An order of the Commission, based upon proper findings and conclusions, requiring appellant to continue operation of her utilities would not violate constitutional prohibitions against involuntary servitude.
                        Appellant voluntarily put her land and equipment to a public use and collected compensation for the services which she provided, and having done so, the Commission may require that she continue to use it in the service to which
                        she voluntarily dedicated it so long as she is justly compensated for such service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Mackie, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 338 S.E.2d 888 (1986), modified and

                        Showing Required for Abandonment. - When a public utility seeks to abandon service, it must establish that the public no longer needs the service which it was created to render, or that there is no reasonable probability of its being able to realize sufficient
                        revenue by the rendition of such service to meet its expenses. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Haywood Elec. Membership Corp., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 59</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 865 (1963).

                    <p>
                        Where a utility seeks authorization to abandon service, the ultimate issue for resolution is whether the operation of the system can produce sufficient revenues to meet the expenses of operation. To resolve this issue, there must be findings of fact as
                        to the reasonable expenses of operation and the revenues which the system may be reasonably expected to produce. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Mackie, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 338 S.E.2d

                        The burden is on the utility seeking authorization to abandon service to establish that there is no reasonable probability of its being able to realize sufficient revenue by the rendition of such service to meet its expenses. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                        The doctrine of convenience and necessity is a relative or elastic theory rather than an abstract or absolute rule. The facts in each case must be separately considered, and from those facts it must be determined whether or not public convenience and
                        necessity require a given service to be performed or dispensed with. The convenience and necessity required are those of the public and not of an individual or individuals. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Ry.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 73</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 21 (1961).

                        Waste of a utility's manpower or other resources, with no substantial resulting benefit to the public, is not in the public interest and is not required. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 242</cite>,
                        150 S.E.2d 386 (1966).

                        A railroad may not be denied the right to curtail or abandon a service for which there is no substantial public need, even though, upon its entire business, the company is earning a fair rate of return. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Atlantic C.L.R.R.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 242</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 386 (1966).

                    <p>
                        Though prosperous, a railroad or other utility company may not be denied the right to effect economies in its operation, so as to increase its earnings, unless it may reasonably be found, upon the evidence before the Commission, that the public convenience
                        and necessity requires the continuation of the service in question. An occasional inconvenience to a shipper, which is trivial in comparison with the saving to the railroad from the elimination of the service, will not suffice
                        to show such public convenience and necessity. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 242</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 386 (1966).

                        Railroad May Be Required to Retain Station Required by Public Convenience and Necessity. - A railroad may be required to keep a station open, with an agent in attendance, if the public convenience and necessity requires such service, even though this
                        can be done only at a loss to the railroad, provided such loss is not so great as to be unreasonable in comparison with the public's benefit from the service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Atlantic C.L.R.R.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 242</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 386 (1966).

                        Railroad May Not Substantially Reduce Hours Station Is Open Without Commission's Order. - A liberal construction of G.S. 62-2, 62-32, 62-131 and 62-247 and this section, so as to effectuate the policy of the State as therein declared, compels the conclusion
                        that when a railroad corporation has established and maintained a freight depot or passenger station pursuant to the order of the Commission, or has established and maintained for a year or more such depot or station on its own
                        initiative, it may not, without first obtaining an order from the Commission authorizing it to do so, substantially reduce the number of hours per day during which such station shall be kept open and attended by an agent of the
                        railroad for the service of the public. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 242</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 386 (1966).

                    <p>
                        But Commission May Not Withhold Approval of Reduction Unreasonably. - When a railroad company applies for an order authorizing it to substantially reduce the number of hours per day during which a depot or station shall be kept open and attended by an
                        agent, the Commission may not withhold its approval unreasonably and arbitrarily. It may deny such permission only after a hearing and only if it finds and concludes, upon competent, material and substantial evidence, in view of
                        the entire record, both that the public convenience and necessity requires the station or depot to be so kept open for a greater portion of the day, and that the railroad, by so doing, will not incur costs out of proportion to
                        any benefit to the public. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 242</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 386 (1966).

                        Evidence Held to Show Convenience and Necessity. - Evidence before the Commission indicating that a number of the residences served by applicant's water and sewer systems were situated on quarter-acre lots, which were of insufficient size to support both
                        a well and septic system, and that the occupants of these residences, who were currently among appellant's customers, had no alternative means of water supply or sewage disposal other than the service provided by appellant, clearly
                        supported the conclusion not only that appellant's services constituted a convenience to that segment of the public who used them, but also that such services were necessary to the safety and health of the public. State ex rel.

                    The General Assembly of North Carolina finds that as a matter of public policy it is in the interest of the State to encourage the leasing of solar energy facilities for retail customers and subscription to shared community solar energy facilities. The
                    General Assembly further finds and declares that in encouraging the leasing of and subscription to solar energy facilities pursuant to this act, cross-subsidization should be avoided by holding harmless electric public utilities' customers
                    that do not participate in such arrangements.

                        Purpose of Regulation. - With public utilities the State has undertaken to protect the public from the customary consequences of monopoly, by making the rates and services of the certificate holder subject to regulation and control by the Utilities Commission.
                        In re Certificate of Need for Aston Park Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 542</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 729 (1973).

                        An uncontrolled legal monopoly in an essential service leads, normally and naturally, to poor service and exorbitant charges. To prevent such result, the legislature has conferred upon the Utilities Commission the power to police the operations of the
                        utility company, so as to require it to render service of good quality at charges which are reasonable. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>, 189 S.E.2d

                        Rate Making Within Police Power of State. - The authority conferred upon the Commission to establish reasonable and just rates for charges by a public service corporation for furnishing electrical power to its customers comes within the police powers
                        of the State, and contracts previously made are subordinate to the public interest that such rates be reasonable and just, and afford the corporation supplying the service a safe return upon its investments, having proper regard
                        to the public interest that plants of this character should be properly run and maintained. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Cannon Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 17</cite>, 116 S.E. 178 (1923).

                        The Commission is given general supervision over railways, street railways, and like companies of the State, and is empowered to fix such notes, charges and tariffs as may be reasonable and just, having in view the value of the property, the cost of improvements
                        and maintenance, the probable earning capacity under the proposed rates, the sums required to meet operating expenses, and other specific matters pertinent to such an inquiry; these are police powers, delegated to the Commission,

                        Authority of the Utilities Commission to set different rates is not unbridled. There must be substantial differences in service or conditions to justify difference in rates. There must be no unreasonable discrimination between those receiving the same
                        kind and degree of service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 424</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 647 (1976).

                        Duty to Fix Just and Reasonable Rates. - When the Commission is called upon by either a corporation or those to whom the services are rendered under its franchise to exercise its rate fixing power and authority, it is its duty to fix and establish just
                        and reasonable rates to be charged for such services. Corporation Comm'n v. Henderson Water Co., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 70</cite>, 128 S.E. 465 (1925).

                        Classification Must Not Be Arbitrary. - The mere fact of classification in rate regulating is not sufficient to relieve a statute from the reach of the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in all cases it must appear, not merely that a classification
                        has been made, but also that it is based upon some reasonable ground, something which bears a just and proper relation to the attempted classification and is not a mere arbitrary selection. Gulf, C. &amp; S.F. Ry. v. Ellis, 165

                        Rates Set by Commission Supersede Contrary Private Contract Provisions. - Rates for public utility service fixed by an order of the Commission, otherwise lawful, supersede contrary provisions in private contracts concerning rates for such service. State

                        The rates of transportation allowed carriers of freight are established by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the State Corporation Commission (now the Utilities Commission), and may not be affected by any agreement to the contrary between the carriers
                        or their agents or employees and the shipper; notwithstanding any such agreement, the carrier may demand and enforce the rates established by law. Southern Ry. v. Latham, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 417</cite>,

                        A public service railway corporation operating in various localities may not by contract fix its passenger fares and thus prevent the Commission, under the authority conferred by statute, from determining what rates are, under the circumstances, just
                        and reasonable, for such would authorize such companies to discriminate, unlawfully, among its patrons. Southern Pub. Utils. Co. v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 151</cite>, 101 S.E.

                        Enforcement of Such Rates Does Not Impair Obligations of Contract. - The enforcement of an order of the Commission superseding rates set by contract does not constitute an impairment of the obligation of such contract, since contracts of public utilities,
                        fixing rates for service, are subject to the police power of the State. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. VEPCO, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 398</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 283 (1974).

                        The Commission has plenary authority to modify an application by a utility when its modification is based on competent evidence, findings and conclusions showing it to be just and reasonable. The Commission is not limited by the utility's application
                        in the entry of its final order based on evidence adduced at the hearings. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 361</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 671 (1976).

                        Rates Must Be Fixed Prospectively. - The Utilities Commission exceeded its statutory authority in requiring a manufacturer to pay a surcharge for emergency natural gas used by the manufacturer prior to the date that the tariff including the surcharge
                        became effective, even though the supplier did not bill the manufacturer for such gas until after the tariff became effective. A rate is fixed or allowed when it becomes effective pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, and
                        rates must be fixed prospectively from their effective date. G.S. 62-136(a) provides that the Commission shall determine rates to be thereafter observed and in force. The Commission may not fix rates retroactively so as to make
                        them collectible for past services. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Farmers Chem. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 257 S.E.2d 439 (1979), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 124</cite>,

                        "Tariff" and "Rates" Synonymous. - The word "tariff," used in connection with the rates of a common carrier, did not have any special legal significance that would differentiate it in effect from the word "rates," used in former G.S. 62-148 in connection
                        with a contract carrier. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Fleming, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 660</cite>, 71 S.E.2d 41 (1952).

                    <p>
                        An annual "true up" of the curtailment tracking rate of a natural gas company was not a change in the general fixed rate, since the curtailment tracking rate merely creates an estimated rate based on projected gas availability. Therefore, the "true up"
                        of the CTR is a correction of an estimated rate, and does not constitute retroactive general rate making. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. CF Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 504</cite>, 263 S.E.2d

                        Testing Reasonableness of Affiliated Company Expenses. - The Commission has the authority and the right at all times to test the reasonableness of expenses paid to affiliated companies (or allocated by them) and to cause the petitioning utility to offer
                        affirmative evidence of their reasonableness or risk their disapproval. The Commission has the obligation to test the reasonableness of such expenses whenever they are properly challenged. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Intervenor

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Commission must always determine that expenses paid to affiliated companies are reasonable, and the burden of persuasion on that issue always rests with the utility. The Commission, of course, has the right to test the reasonableness of such expenses.
                        If there is an absence of data and information from which either the propriety of incurring the expense or the reasonableness of the cost can readily be determined, the Commission may require the utility to prove their propriety
                        and reasonableness by affirmative evidence. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Intervenor Residents, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 62</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 770 (1982).

                    <p>
                        Although it always has the authority to do so, in the absence of contradiction or challenge by affirmative evidence offered by any party to the proceeding, the Commission has no affirmative duty to make further inquiry or investigation into the reasonableness
                        of charges or fees paid to affiliated companies. While affiliation calls for close scrutiny, affiliation alone does not impose an additional burden of proof or require the presentation of additional evidence of reasonableness.

                        Reasonableness of affiliated company expenses may be tested on the basis of (1) the cost of the same services on the open market, (2) the cost similar utilities pay to their service companies, or (3) the reasonableness of the expenses incurred by the
                        affiliated company in generating the service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Intervenor Residents, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 62</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 770 (1982).

                        When Fares of Street Railway May Be Raised. - A public service street railway company, operating under a city charter and under a contract with the city restricting the passenger fare authorized to be charged its patrons, may be authorized by the Commission
                        to raise charges to its passengers when, in the opinion of the Commission, such is necessary for it to properly maintain its system, allowing a reasonable profit, to meet the requirements of the public for adequate, safe, and convenient

                        Electric Power Rates Coextensive with State's Jurisdiction. - When the Commission has finally established, under the provisions of the statute, rates to be charged by a public service corporation for furnishing electrical power, the rates are coextensive
                        with the State's jurisdiction and territory, and conclusively bind all corporations, companies, or persons who are parties to the suit and have been afforded an opportunity to be heard. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Cannon Mfg.

                        violation of the rate prescribed by the Railroad Commission (now Utilities Commission). Leavell v. Western Union Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 211</cite>, 21 S.E. 391 (1895), appeal dismissed,

                        Purpose of Chapter. - The clear purpose of this Chapter is to confer upon the Utilities Commission the power and the duty to compel a public utility company to render adequate service and to fix therefor reasonable rates pursuant to the procedure prescribed
                        in G.S. 62-133. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 255</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 405 (1970), aff'd on rehearing, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 235</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 419 (1971).

                        The word "rate" used in the Public Utilities Act refers not only to the monetary amount which each customer must ultimately pay, but also to the published method or schedule by which that amount is figured. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten,

                        Duty and Authority of Commission. - The statutes confer upon the Commission, not upon the Supreme Court, the duty and authority to determine adequacy of service and reasonable rates therefor. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan,

                        There is nothing in the applicable provisions of the Public Utilities Act which prohibits the use of a fossil fuel adjustment clause in the context of the factual circumstances which the utility and the Commission face in a given case. State ex rel. Utils.
                        Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 327</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 651 (1976).

                    <p>
                        Investor Risk and Rate of Return - Factors for Consideration. - The law permits the Commission to consider both size and management in assessing investor risk insofar as such risk may bear on an appropriate return on equity capital; a utility's small
                        size may increase investor risk and justify a higher return. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Staff-North Carolina Utils. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 481</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 361 (1988).

                    <p>
                        While efficient management should not justify a higher common equity rate of return, it is appropriate for the Commission to consider good management as a factor which reduces investor risk and militates in favor of a lower return on equity capital. State

                        Formula Did Not Unreasonably Discriminate. - The North Carolina Utilities Commission's order contained findings sufficient to justify its conclusion that the Industrial Sales Tracker Formula did not unreasonably discriminate between North Carolina Natural
                        Gas Corporation's customer classes and these findings were supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 238</cite>,

                        among the various classes of North Carolina Natural Gas Corporation customers and were supported by substantial evidence in view of the whole record. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers Ass'n,

                        Legitimate Justification for Industrial and City Rates of Return. - The North Carolina Utilities Commission drew legitimate distinctions which justified its decision to maintain industrial and city rates of return at a higher level than residential and
                        commercial and small industrial rates. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 238</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 692 (1988).

                        Testing Reasonableness of Affiliated Company Expenses. - The Commission has the authority and the right at all times to test the reasonableness of expenses paid to affiliated companies (or allocated by them) and to cause the petitioning utility to offer
                        affirmative evidence of their reasonableness or risk their disapproval. The Commission has the obligation to test the reasonableness of such expenses whenever they are properly challenged. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Intervenor
                        Residents, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 62</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 770 (1982).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Commission must always determine that expenses paid to affiliated companies are reasonable and the burden of persuasion on that issue always rests with the utility. The Commission, of course, has the right to test the reasonableness of such expenses.
                        If there is an absence of data and information from which either the propriety of incurring the expense or the reasonableness of the cost can readily be determined, the Commission may require the utility to prove their propriety
                        and reasonableness by affirmative evidence. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Intervenor Residents, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 62</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 770 (1982).

                        Although it always has the authority to do so, in the absence of contradiction or challenge by affirmative evidence offered by any party to the proceeding, the Commission has no affirmative duty to make further inquiry or investigation into the reasonableness
                        of charges or fees paid to affiliated companies. While affiliation calls for close scrutiny, affiliation alone does not impose an additional burden of proof or require the presentation of additional evidence of reasonableness.

                        Utility Must Accept Responsibility. - A public utility, which has been allowed to charge rates sufficient to enable it to maintain its properties, in addition to the earning of a fair return thereon, and which nevertheless permits its properties to fall
                        into such a poor state of maintenance as to impair the quality of its service, must accept the responsibility for its resulting inability to render adequate service to its patrons. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan,

                        Quality of Service to Be Considered in Fixing Rates. - It was not the intent of the legislature to require the Commission to fix rates without any regard to the quality of the service rendered by the utility and thus to assure a "complacent monopoly"
                        a fair return upon the fair value of its properties while it persists in rendering mediocre service and turns a deaf ear both to customer complaints and to Commission orders for improvement. On the contrary, the quality of the
                        service rendered is, necessarily, a factor to be considered in fixing the "just and reasonable" rate therefor. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 671</cite>,

                        should make specific findings showing the effect of any such inadequacy upon its decision under G.S. 62-133 fixing rates which are fair both to the public utility and to the consumer. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel.

                    found by the Commission to be just and reasonable, nondiscriminatory and nonpreferential, to the extent that such rates or charges were collected within two years prior to the filing of such petition.

                    <p>
                        There is in this Article a clear statutory dichotomy between rates which are made, fixed or established by the Commission on the one hand and those which are simply permitted or allowed to go into effect at the instance of the utility on the other. Rates
                        which are established by the Commission, that is after a full hearing, findings, conclusion and a formal order, "shall be deemed just and reasonable, and any rate charged by any public utility different from those so established
                        shall be deemed unjust and unreasonable." Rates which the Commission simply allows to go into effect by any of the methods described in G.S. 62-134 and G.S. 62-135 are subject to being challenged by interested parties or the Commission
                        itself and after a "hearing thereon, if the Commission shall find the rates or charges collected to be other than the rates established by the Commission, and to be unjust, unreasonable, discriminatory or preferential, the Commission
                        may" order refund pursuant to the provisions of this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 327</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 651 (1976).

                        Rates Fixed by Commission Are Prima Facie Valid, Just and Reasonable. - The rates fixed by the Commission are not only prima facie evidence of their validity, but also prima facie evidence that they are just and reasonable. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n

                        Until Modified on Appeal or by Commission. - Rates or charges fixed by an order of the Commission are to be considered just and reasonable unless and until they shall be changed or modified on appeal or by the further action of the Commission itself.

                        was ordered "to remain in full force and effect," these rates so established would be deemed the only just and reasonable rates for this commodity over defendant's lines, rendering it unlawful for defendant to charge a greater

                        between the termini, evidence offered by the carriers as to whether the higher rate was fair and reasonable for the shorter distance was properly excluded, since the carriers should not be permitted to change the rate by reason
                        of a mistake in their tariff distance table, and petitioners were entitled to recover that part of the excess charged which was not barred by the limitation contained in the statute. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Norfolk

                    of federal and State requirements so as to apply the more stringent requirements except to the extent that State requirements may be specifically preempted by federal law. The Commission shall adopt rules to establish a procedure as
                    an alternative to the procedure set out in G.S. 62-133 to annually adjust the rates of electric public utilities to allow timely recovery of all reasonable costs of compliance with the federal and State requirements pursuant to G.S.
                    62-133.8(h), as enacted by Section 2 of this act. In adopting rules to establish the procedure, the Commission shall incorporate the provisions of this act in accordance with this section and the public interest."

                            Constitutionality. - The power to grant franchises to public service corporations and to fix their rates rests in the General Assembly, which power the General Assembly may delegate to an administrative agency, provided the General Assembly prescribes
                            rules and standards to guide such agency in the exercise of the delegated authority. The statute delegating to the Utilities Commission this authority is constitutional in fixing adequate rules and standards. State ex rel.

                            Stimulation of the economy is an essential public and governmental purpose and the manner in which this purpose is to be accomplished is, within constitutional limits, exclusively a legislative decision. The authority to set rates to be charged by a public
                            utility for its services rests in the legislature and is delegated by it to the Utilities Commission under sufficient rules and standards to guide the Commission in exercising this power. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. North

                            Commerce Clause Not Violated. - The North Carolina Utilities Commission is authorized by Congress to act with regard to arrangements between cogenerators and power company, so that the commission's disallowance of the amount by which contracts exceeded
                            the company's avoided costs was consistent with federal laws and regulations and constituted lawful retail ratemaking. The commission's actions did not violate the Commerce Clause. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. North Carolina

                            Requirement That Utility Prefile Testimony Prior to That of Intervenors Is Constitutional. - A utility's due process rights were not violated by requiring it to prefile its testimony prior to the prefiling of the intervenors' testimony and requiring it
                            to file its brief concurrently with the intervenors, where it should have been forewarned of what the intervenors intended to show. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co.,

                            The primary purpose of this Chapter is not to guarantee to the stockholders of a public utility constant growth in the value of and in the dividend yield from their investment, but is to assure the public of adequate service at a reasonable charge. State

                            The provisions of this Chapter designed to assure the utility of adequate revenues are in the nature of corollaries to the basic proposition that the public is entitled to adequate service at reasonable rates and safeguards against administrative action
                            which would violate constitutional protections by confiscation of the utility's property. Without such assurance, the owners of capital would not invest in the utility's bonds or stock and the utility could not provide the
                            plant necessary for the rendering of adequate service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 671</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 681 (1974).

                            By adopting this section, the legislature intended to establish an overall scheme for fixing rates, and this section must be interpreted in its entirety in order to comply with the legislative intent. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Duke Power Co.,

                            Purpose of Former Subsection (f). - The purpose of former subsection (f) of this section was to allow the retailer to automatically pass on to the consumer changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas, over which neither the retailer nor the Utilities
                            Commission had control, whenever the natural gas suppliers' price was revised upward or downward, thus avoiding costly and protracted rate proceedings. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. CF Indus., Inc.,

                        <p>
                            Former subsection (f) was a mechanism whereby a natural gas utility could pass on to its customers supplier increases or decreases without going through the costly and protracted procedures of a general rate case. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Former subsection (f) dealt only with rate changes while G.S. 62-136(c) specifically sets forth the criteria pursuant to which refunds should be distributed. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Serv. Co., <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 474</cite>,

                        <p>
                            G.S. 62-136(c) more specifically applies to supplier refunds received by natural gas distributing utilities than did former subsection (f) and is the proper statute to be applied in determining the appropriate distribution of these supplier refunds. State

                            Proceeding Is General Rate Case Where Question Is Fair Return on Investment. - The Commission was correct in conducting the proceeding as a general rate case, where the primary question was what is a fair rate of return on the utility's investment so
                            as to enable it by sound management to pay a fair profit to its stockholders and to maintain and expand its facilities and services in accordance with the reasonable requirement of its creditors. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                            It is a well-established rule that it is for the administrative body, in an adjudicatory proceeding, to determine the weight and sufficiency of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, to draw inferences from the facts, and to appraise conflicting
                            and circumstantial evidence. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Thornburg, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 509</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 772 (1985).

                            of the nuclear station. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Eddleman, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 344</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 339 (1987).

                            viewed as mere increased revenues for the LECs, but to provide funds to set off those expenditures that the LECs were required to make to provide additional facilities to handle additional carrier access. The imposition of
                            the access charge tariff was within the authority granted to the Commission by the 1984 amendments to G.S. 62-110. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                            imposed upon the legislature by the State and federal Constitutions. The Commission, however, does not have the full power of the legislature, but only that portion conferred upon it in this Chapter. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

         Statute Controls Commission in Establishing Rates.
        </b> - In establishing rates, the Commission is governed and controlled by the provisions of this section. Southern Ry. v. McNeill, 155 F. 756 (E.D.N.C. 1907).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The legislative mandate is that the Commission shall fix rates which will enable a well managed utility to earn a "fair rate of return" on the "fair value" if its properties are "used and useful" in rendering its service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.
                            Duke Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 377</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 269 (1974).

                        <p>
                            The responsibility for fixing rates rests with the Utilities Commission and not the Supreme Court. However, there is nothing in the statutes that requires the Commission to accept the rate or rates proposed, or to reject them altogether. State ex rel.

                        <p>
                            It is the prerogative of the Commission, and not the Court of Appeals, to decide the question as to what constitutes fair and reasonable rates that may be charged by a utility, as the Commission is an agency composed of men of special knowledge, observation,
                            and experience in their field, and has at hand a staff trained for this type of work, and the law imposes upon it, not the Court of Appeals, the duty to fix the rates. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan,

                            Commission's Rate Making Powers Not Governed by Principles of Res Judicata. - Since the exercise of the Commission's rate making power is a legislative rather than a judicial function, such orders are not governed by the principles of res judicata, and
                            are reviewable in later appeals of closely related matters. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Thornburg, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 463</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 451 (1989).

                            "general rate cases" in which appellee sought Commission authority to increase its electric rates and charges, and where in fixing the rates to be charged by the utility, the Commission was exercising a function delegated to
                            it by the legislative branch of the government. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Thornburg, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 463</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 451 (1989).

                            Tax Reform Benefits Passed on to Ratepayers by Rulemaking Rather Than Ratemaking Procedure. - Utilities Commission may pass on to the ratepayers the benefits of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA-86) through a rulemaking procedure rather than a ratemaking
                            procedure. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 190</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 118 (1990).

                            Nowhere in subdivision (b)(1) is there a requirement that the Commission make findings as to the cost of each project and when it will be needed. To require such extensive evidence would put an undue burden on the utility and cause the rate-making process
                            to be more time consuming and difficult of administration. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Conservation Council, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 59</cite>, 320 S.E.2d 679 (1984).

                        <p>
                            Subdivision (b)(1) does not require the Commission to make new findings on the need for construction. Before any public utility begins the construction of a facility for generating electricity for use by the public it must first obtain from the Commission
                            a certificate stating that public convenience and necessity requires, or will require such construction. Before such a certificate can be granted the applicant must file an estimate of construction costs and the Commission
                            must hold public hearings. This procedure satisfies the argument that the construction must be necessary. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Conservation Council, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 59</cite>,

                            Commission to Fix Rates as Low as Constitutionally Possible. - The origin of this section supports the inference that the legislature intended for the Commission to fix rates as low as may be reasonably consistent with the requirements of the due process

                            Determination of Credibility and Weight of Evidence. - As a general rule, it is for the Commission, not the reviewing court, to determine the credibility of and the weight to be given to all competent evidence. The rule is fully applicable when there
                            is conflicting testimony by experts as to which method among those available to experts in their field is best suited for use in resolving a particular question they are asked to address as experts. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                            When the record, considered as a whole, contains substantial evidence supporting the subjective judgment of the Commission on any of these factors in the fixing of reasonable rates, the conclusion reached by the Commission may not be disturbed by a reviewing

                            Under this section the determination of what constitutes a fair rate of return requires the exercise of a subjective judgment by the Commission and its decision may not be disturbed by a reviewing court merely because the court's subjective judgment is

                            Steps Which Commission Must Take Prescribed by Section. - In order to assure the utility of earnings sufficient to attract capital and also in order to limit its charges for service to levels sufficient for that purpose, the legislature has prescribed
                            in this section the steps which the Commission must take in fixing such charges. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 705 (1972).

                            Fixing of "reasonable and just" rates involves a balancing of shareholder and consumer interests; the Utilities Commission must therefore set rates which will protect both the right of the public utility to earn a fair rate of return for its shareholders
                            and ensure its financial integrity, while also protecting the right of the utility's intrastate customers to pay a retail rate which reasonably and fairly reflects the cost of service rendered on their behalf. State ex rel.

                            The question of whether rates prescribed under this Chapter are so unreasonable and unjust to the company and its stockholders that they amount to an unconstitutional confiscation of a utility's property necessarily involves an inquiry as to what is reasonable
                            and just for the public. The public cannot properly be subject to unreasonable rates in order simply that stockholders may earn dividends. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co.,

                            Rates to Be Based on Domestic Business. - The reasonableness of the rates to be fixed by the State must be decided with reference exclusively to what is just and reasonable in respect of domestic business. Hence, when a company operates in two or more
                            states, the operations are treated as separate businesses for the purpose of rate regulation. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Lee Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 702</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 319

                            The Utilities Commission is empowered and directed to make reasonable and just rates as applied to the distribution and sale of power in this State and not otherwise, and such power cannot be directly controlled or weakened by conditions existent in other
                            states, either from the action or nonaction of official bodies there or from dealings between private parties. To hold otherwise would, in its practical operation, be to withdraw or nullify the powers that this section professes
                            to confer. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Lee Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 702</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 319 (1965).

                            But Net Return Earned in Other States May Be Considered. - In fixing intrastate rates for a telephone company operating in several states, the Utilities Commission should take into consideration the net return such utility earns on its properties in such
                            other states to the extent of not requiring customers in North Carolina, in order to maintain the utility's financial condition, to pay a substantially higher rate than permitted in other states. A substantial differential
                            might be considered some evidence that the rates charged in this State are unreasonable and unjust to the local public. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. State, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 333</cite>,

                            it is not required to guarantee the return requested by the utility where the facts and circumstances warrant otherwise. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 614</cite>,

                            Rate Increase Conforming with Interstate Rates Allowed by Interstate Commerce Commission. - An order of the Utilities Commission increasing intrastate rates of State carriers so that such rates would conform with an increase in interstate rates allowed
                            by the Interstate Commerce Commission was invalid where such order was unsupported by proof of the fair value of the properties of the carriers used and useful in conducting their intrastate business, separate and apart from

                            The ultimate question in determining appropriate rates is: What is a reasonable rate to be charged by the particular utility company for the service it proposes to render in the immediate future? The determination of this question is for the Commission,

                            What is a "just and reasonable" rate which will produce a fair return on the investment depends on: (1) the value of the investment, usually referred to in rate-making cases as the rate base, which earns the return; (2) the gross income received by the
                            applicant from its authorized operations; (3) the amount to be deducted for operating expenses, which must include the amount of capital investment currently consumed in rendering the service; and (4) what rate constitutes

                            evidence does not show what changes there may be in matching costs and revenues, the Commission does not have to allow additions to the rate base for a used and useful plant. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Water Serv., Inc.,

                            is slight at best, but where there is evidence of substantial similarity of conditions, evidence of comparative rates may have some relevancy for use as a guide to the limits of the zone of reasonableness. State ex rel. Utils.

                            the efficiency of a company's operation in fixing its rates in a general rate case as provided in this section, although plant efficiency as it bears upon fuel cost is not a factor to be considered in the limited and expedited

                            incur the anticipated expense, for the payment of which it collected revenues in prior months, its rates for present and future service may not be cut, on that account, below what it otherwise would be entitled to charge for

                            In considering whether fuel adjustment clause would ever operate to increase utility's rate of return, the Commission was entitled to act on the normal assumption in rate cases generally, there being no evidence to the contrary, that other costs of the
                            utility would not decline but would probably increase or at least remain fairly constant. In the unlikely event that other costs of the utility should decline, the Commission, either on its own motion or that of another interested
                            party, has plenary authority to intervene and make corrections in the utility's rate schedules including, if circumstances should require it, the abrogation of the fuel clause. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten,

                            parent and customer, left the utility with insufficient resources to meet its steadily increasing public load and lacking in contractual power supply arrangements tailored to meet its public service needs at reasonable prices,
                            it was well within the Commission's rate making authority to shift the onus of those managerial shortcomings from the pockets of utility's retail rate payers to the corporate offices of the aluminum producing company. State

                            for as long as the rates fixed in the case remained in effect. The Commission should have provided for a lump-sum refund (i.e., a onetime rate reduction) or a rate reduction over a period of time. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                            Court-Ordered Refund Is Not Retroactive Rate Making. - The Supreme Court has the power to direct the Commission to order refunds from rates established by final order of the Commission. This would not constitute retroactive rate making prohibited under
                            the North Carolina Statutes. Retroactive rate making occurs when the utility is required to refund revenues collected, pursuant to the then lawfully established rates, for such past use. A rate has not been lawfully established
                            simply because the Commission has ordered it. If the Commission makes an error of law in its order from which there is a timely appeal the rates put into effect by that order have not been "lawfully established" until the appellate

                            The North Carolina Utilities Commission reviewed the capacity rate set by an arbitrator and determined that he did not properly take into account other potential sources of power, thus his assessment of avoided costs was unreasonably high, and its exclusion
                            of expenses for capacity payments was merely the disallowance of the amount by which the contract rate exceeded power company's avoided costs; therefore the commission properly disallowed expenses for unreasonably high payments

                            There Is But One Rate Base. - It is incorrect to speak of "the original cost rate base" and the "trended original cost rate base." There is but one rate base, namely, the fair value of the public utility's property used and useful in providing the service
                            rendered to the public within this State, which value the Commission must determine as of the end of the test period. The original cost of the properties is simply evidence to be considered in making this determination. The
                            replacement cost, whether determined by use of trended cost indices or otherwise, is also but evidence of the fair value of the properties. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 255</cite>,

                            Property Held for Future Use. - A telephone company, with central office equipment sufficient to serve any reasonably anticipated increase in customers, may not properly add to its rate base additional units of central office equipment merely because,
                            in the long future, it hopes to have customers who will use it. This is especially true where the supplier of such equipment is an affiliated corporation, controlled by the same holding company which controls the telephone

                            Before 1977 amendment of subdivision (b)(1), utilities were not allowed to include construction work in progress (CWIP) in rate base. Instead, a utility would add together all of the costs incurred by a project each year and multiply that by the allowance
                            for funds used during construction (AFUDC) rate. The AFUDC rate is a rate of interest which represents as nearly as possible the actual cost of money used for construction. The figure that results from multiplying the costs
                            times the AFUDC rate is capitalized annually until the plant comes into service and is then recovered along with the original costs of the plant. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Conservation Council,

                            Meaning of "Value" - The term "value" in this section does not refer to the original or the replacement cost of the property or to the exchange or sales price it would command, as used or secondhand property, on the market. It has reference to the value
                            of the property actually in use, serving its purpose as a part of a composite public utility, earning an income for its owner. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. State, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 333</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Value is not the price for which the property could be sold as used or secondhand property. It is not the sale or exchange value of the entire business as a going concern. It is not the same as the fair value to be awarded by a jury in a condemnation
                            case. The concept of "fair value," as used with reference to a public utility's rate base, is unique to rate making. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>,

                            State, becomes of critical importance in the rate-making process, for only after the determination of this rate base can judgment be intelligently exercised fixing the rate of return which the utility is entitled to receive
                            on the fair value of its property and fixing rates to be charged by the utility which are fair both to the public utility and to the consumer. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co.,

                            Factors to Be Considered in Determining Fair Value. - This section contemplates a weighing of (1) the reasonable original cost, less depreciation, (2) the replacement cost, which may be determined by trending such reasonable depreciated cost to current
                            cost levels or by any other reasonable method, and (3) any other relevant factor, by the Commission in the exercise of its own expert judgment in determining "fair value." State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co.,

                            This section contemplates that, normally, the Commission will ascertain the "fair value" of the properties at a point somewhere between the original cost, less depreciation, and the cost of replacement new, less depreciation. The Commission has the duty
                            to weigh these evidences of "fair value" and may not disregard either, or brush either aside. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>, 189 S.E.2d

                            Fair Value Not Ascertainable by Mathematical Formula. - "Replacement cost" and "fair value" are not synonymous. Nor is "fair value" an arithmetical average of original cost and replacement cost, less depreciation, nor is it to be ascertained by the application
                            of any mathematical formula. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 705 (1972); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. City of Durham,

                            Neither original cost, depreciated, nor replacement cost, depreciated is the measure of "fair value." They are indicators of "fair value" and their respective weights are to be determined by the Commission in its expert judgment. State ex rel. Utils.

                            Balancing of Factors by Commission in Determining Fair Value. - Having made properly supported findings, it is for the Commission, not the reviewing court, to determine, in its expert discretion and by the use of "balanced scales," the relative weights
                            to be given these several factors in ascertaining the ultimate fact of "fair value." State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 41,

                            both the original cost and the reproduction cost of existing plant before weighing these factors in ascertaining the present "fair value" rate base of the utility's properties as required by this section. State ex rel. Utils.

                            Effect of Improper Plant Engineering and Maintenance. - Neither the original cost nor the reproduction cost may properly be taken as the present fair value of telephone properties which were improperly engineered, have not been properly maintained, and
                            are consequently in need of extensive rehabilitation. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 255</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 405 (1970), reaffirmed, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 235</cite>,

                            The fact that a plant or a unit thereof is not well adapted to, or is inappropriate for, its present and/or reasonably to be anticipated future use tends materially to reduce its value below its reproduction new cost. One of the forms of inappropriateness

                            The fair value of a new addition, when completed and in service, would almost certainly be found to be its total cost and, thereafter, would be found by considering such cost and the reproduction, or trended, cost, including interest during construction.

                            "Fair value" does not cover money stupidly, extravagantly, or corruptly spent and if a utility has been seriously overbuilt, or its promoters have been seriously overpaid, the law does not intend that its customers shall be saddled with the payment of

                            It is not the meaning of subsection (b)(1) that, in the absence of expert opinion testimony as to the weight to be given the respective indicators of "fair value," the Commission must give them equal weight and find "fair value" by the mere striking of

                            Having made findings of the original cost less depreciation and replacement cost less depreciation, the weight to be given those figures in reaching the ultimate finding of fair value is to be determined by the Commission, not by the reviewing court.

                            A finding of "fair value" by the Commission is not rendered immune to judicial review by Commission's declaration that, in reaching such finding, it followed no formula. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co.,

                            When Commission's Finding of Fair Value May Be Set Aside. - The determination of the weight to be given each factor in its ascertainment of "fair value" is for the Commission, not the reviewing court. But if it is clear from the record that the Commission
                            reached its finding of "fair value" by disregarding or giving minimal consideration to one of the enumerated factors, its finding of the ultimate fact of "fair value" may be set aside by the court on the ground of error of
                            law in such ascertainment. Similarly, the finding of "fair value" may be set aside by the reviewing court if it clearly appears that the Commission has made its determination thereof by giving weight to a factor as to which
                            there is no substantial evidence in the record, and likewise where the order of the Commission shows that it reached its determination of "fair value" by considering unspecified facts other than original cost and replacement

                            not necessarily be so. Even in such a case the Commission may find that the management of the utility acted improvidently or carelessly and paid a price greater than reasonable. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co.,

                            Determining Reasonable Original Cost of Property Sold to Utility by Affiliated Corporation. - In determining the rate base, the fact that equipment or services are sold to the utility by an affiliated corporation does not alter the ultimate question for
                            the Commission. That question is whether the prices paid by the utility are reasonable and, therefore, reflect the "reasonable original cost" of the properties. The only effect of the affiliation between the utility and its
                            supplier is that such relationship calls for a close scrutiny by the Commission of the price paid by the utility. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>,

                        <p>
                            For purposes of determining a utilities rate base, when considering a purchase made from an affiliated company, the bargaining is not at arm's length and when the transaction is called in question, the burden is upon the utility to show that the price
                            it paid was reasonable. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 705 (1972).

                            In cases in which a substantial portion of a utility's property was acquired by purchase from an affiliated company, it becomes obligatory upon the Commission to scrutinize the prices paid and, to the extent it finds such prices unreasonable, to make
                            adjustments in the utility's figures accordingly. This is all the more true where the affiliated supplier so dominates the market that its pricing policies may not be sufficiently controlled by normal competition. State ex

                            determine the reasonableness of the prices charged by the manufacturing company by comparing its rate of return on common equity with the rates of return experienced by other manufacturing companies operating in similar fields.

                            Necessity of Finding Replacement Cost. - Without a finding by the Commission of the replacement cost of a public utility's properties "used and useful in providing the service," the Commission's finding of "fair value" was affected by an error of law
                            and, consequently, its finding of a fair rate of return on such "fair value" was so affected and was premature. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 318</cite>,

                            "Depreciation" Defined. - Broadly speaking, depreciation is the loss not restored by current maintenance which is due to all the factors causing the ultimate retirement of the property. While property remains in the plant, the estimated depreciation rate
                            is applied to the book cost and the resulting amounts are charged currently as expenses of operation. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. State, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 333</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 133

                            Depreciation Deductions. - For rate-making purposes a public utility is allowed to deduct annually, as an operating expense, so much of its capital investment as is actually consumed during the current year in rendering the service required of it. But
                            the cost represents the amount of the investment, and it is the actual cost, not theretofore recouped by depreciation deductions, that must constitute the base for this allowance. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. State,

                            In establishing rates a public utility is entitled to deduct each year as an operating expense only such depreciation as represents the investment currently consumed and not provided against by maintenance. Thus the integrity of the investment is maintained,
                            and this is all the utility has a right to demand. The rate should be fixed, as near as may be, so that it will extend over the usable life of the property being depreciated. Otherwise the allowance will be unjust either to
                            the utility or to the public. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. State, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 333</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 133 (1954).

                            The purpose of an annual allowance for depreciation and the resulting accumulation of a depreciation reserve is not, as is sometimes erroneously supposed, to provide the utility with a fund by which it may purchase a replacement for the property when
                            it is worn out. The purpose of the allowance is to enable the utility to recover the cost of such property to it. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Heater Util., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 457</cite>,

                            if the rate of depreciation allowed for rate-making purposes is in excess of the investment currently consumed, over and above maintenance costs, it is unfair to the public, for then the company is permitted to recover annually

                            The financial condition of a public utility and the demand for its bonds and securities which affect its capacity to compete on the open market for additional equity and debt capital are ordinarily material considerations in fixing rates. But these factors
                            are of little moment where the applicant has available at all times a fund provided by its parent company from which it may borrow at will for needed improvements or enlargements. What it has to pay for its borrowings from
                            this fund is of more importance. These are some of the "other facts" the statute requires the Commission to consider. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. State, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 333</cite>,

                            Capital Investment Determined as of Time Rates Are Effective. - Where a utility is currently investing large amounts of capital in expansion, the Utility Commission should determine the capital invested as of the time the rates fixed by it are to be effective,
                            rather than the average net investment of the utility for the entire test year, since the rates fixed are prospective. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Piedmont Natural Gas Co., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 536</cite>,

                            current bills for materials and supplies, that fact must be taken into consideration. And if the fund on hand is sufficient, no additional sum should be allowed at the expense of the public. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. State,

                            Determination of Rate of Return. - Determining the effective rate of return for a particular North Carolina Natural Gas Corporation (NCNG) customer class involves a mathematical computation containing several components. The computation must be performed
                            after the fact by utilizing the financial information for a given test year with adjustments made for any subsequent increase in rates. There are in the computation three basic components which must be ascertained. First, an
                            allocation must be made to determine the portion of the total rate base applicable to each customer class. Likewise an allocation must be made to determine the cost of service or operating expenses applicable to each customer
                            class. Finally, the revenues NCNG collected from each customer class for the test period, adjusted for any subsequent increase in rates, must also be determined. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers Ass'n,

                            The formula for determining the rate of return for each customer class is as follows: Operating revenues less cost of service (operating expenses and taxes) divided by the rate base equals the rate of return. Thus, the rate of return for any particular
                            customer class varies inversely with the amount of the rate base and the amount of the cost of service, and directly with the amount of the revenues, allocated to that customer class. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina

                            Consideration of Factors Held Proper. - With regard to investor risk, it was not improper for the Commission to consider the fact that a natural gas supply company was a "small but efficient and well managed natural gas utility." State ex rel. Utils.

                            which must include the amount of capital investment currently consumed in rendering the service; and (4) what rate constitutes a just and reasonable rate of return on the predetermined rate base. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                            rendering acceptable service, there is a zone of reasonableness extending over a few hundredths of one percent, within which a rate of return fixed by a regulatory commission will not be disturbed by the courts. State ex rel.

                            It is impossible to fix rates which will give the utility each day a fair return, and no more, upon its plant in service on that day. The best that can be done, both from the standpoint of the company and from the standpoint of the person served, is to
                            fix rates on the basis of a substantial period of time. Otherwise, rate hearings and adjustments would be a perpetual process. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 327</cite>,

                            Utility Not Entitled to Compensation for Past Deficit. - Failure of utility, in a previous period, to earn the anticipated return over and above its then expenses, does not authorize it to charge its present customers a rate higher than reasonable for
                            present service in order to compensate for the past deficit. Prospective rate-making to recover unexpected past expense, or to refund expected past expense which did not materialize, is as improper as is retroactive rate-making.

                            on equity; the findings were supported by the evidence, including public witness testimony, expert testimony, and the parties' stipulation, and thus the Commission made sufficient findings regarding the impact of changing economic

                            where: (1) although the 10.5 percent return on common equity agreed to in a non-unanimous stipulation fell within the range of returns on common equity recommended by the witnesses, no witness specifically recommended an return
                            on common equity of 10.5 percent; (2) the Commission did not weigh any testimony presented, but merely recited the witnesses' testimony; (3) the Commission did not discuss why one witness's testimony was more credible than
                            another's or which methodology was afforded the greatest weight; (4) the Commission adopted the stipulated return on common equity wholesale, as opposed to considering it as one piece of evidence to be weighed in making an

                            Basic, underlying theory of using company's operating experience in a test period, recently ended, in fixing rates to be charged by it for its service in the near future is that rates for service, in effect throughout the test period, will, in the near
                            future, produce the same rate of return on the company's property, used in rendering such service, as was produced by them on such property in the test period, adjusted for known changes in conditions. State ex rel. Utils.

                            and from the standpoint of the persons served, is to fix rates on the basis of a substantial period of time. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 235</cite>, 179

                            Test Period Fixed to Estimate Revenues and Operating Expenses. - For the purpose of making required estimates of the public utility's revenues and operating expenses, the customary and proper procedure is for the Commission to fix a test period of 12
                            months, ending, as close as practicable, before the opening of the hearing. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 308</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 95 (1972).

                            The plain language of subsection (c) merely provides that the components of the rate making formula are to be determined based on an historical test period, and do not require a nexus between operating expenses and "property used and useful." The statute
                            reserves this requirement solely to the reasonable original cost of the public utility's property, the ratebase component which is described in subdivision (b)(1). State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Thornburg,

                            12 months by application of the previously established rates for service conditions existing at the end of the test period; i.e., at the date, nearest the present, for which data are available. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                            This section requires the Commission to adjust test period data to reflect abnormalities which had a probable impact on the utility's revenues and expenses during the test period. This allows for a reasonably accurate estimate of what may be anticipated
                            in the future. However, no pro forma adjustment is to be made unless the Commission finds that an abnormality having a probable impact on the utility's revenues and expenses existed during the test period. State ex rel. Utils.

                            Since fuel costs comprise a large portion of a utility's expenses, the statutory mandate to normalize test period data includes a requirement that the Commission adjust the test period fuel costs for any abnormalities established by competent, material,

                            there was no correlation between the use of post-test year salary expenses and the utility's increase in customers, as the Commission in its order explained that the use of 1985 estimated salary expenditures was appropriate
                            because it had ordered additional improvements and increased routine maintenance, and thus the increased allowance in operating expenses for salaries did not require any offsetting change in revenue. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                            it persists in rendering mediocre service and turns a deaf ear both to customer complaints and to Commission orders for improvement. On the contrary, the quality of the service rendered is, necessarily, a factor to be considered

                            sufficient to pay the interest on its indebtedness and a substantial dividend upon its stock, but less than that which would be deemed a fair return upon the fair value of its properties were the service adequate, the Utilities
                            Commission may lawfully deny it authority to increase its rates for such service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 671</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 681 (1974).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inadequacy of service due not to the condition of the properties but to inefficient personnel, bad management and the indifference of a "complacent monopoly" does not relate to the value of the properties, but to the value of the service and to the reasonableness
                            of the rates proposed to be charged therefor. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 671</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 681 (1974).

                            If reduction from fair value of utilities' properties is because of inadequate service due to inefficient personnel and human error, then the reduction amounts to a penalty, and a further penalty for inadequate service by reduction of rate is not justified
                            by statute or by decided cases. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. General Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 204 S.E.2d 529, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 671</cite>,

                            Finding Required as to Quality of Service. - The Commission may not lawfully ignore the duty imposed upon it by this section to consider the quality of service by reason of the company's poor service, nor does it discharge that duty by a mere statement
                            that it has considered the matter, without showing the effect given to it. Such finding or conclusion is necessary to enable a reviewing court to determine whether the duty imposed by statute has been performed. State ex rel.

                        Notwithstanding the methods for fixing water and sewer rates under G.S. 62-133 or G.S. 62-133.1, upon application by a water or sewer utility in a general rate proceeding, the Commission may approve a Water and Sewer Investment Plan. A Water and Sewer
                        Investment Plan, as filed by a water or sewer utility, shall include performance-based metrics that benefit customers and ensure the provision of safe, reliable, and cost-effective service by the water or sewer utility. For purposes
                        of this section, "Water and Sewer Investment Plan" means a plan under which the Commission sets water or sewer base rates, revenue requirements through banding of authorized returns as provided in this section, and authorizes annual
                        rate changes for a three-year period based on reasonably known and measurable capital investments and anticipated reasonable and prudent expenses approved under the plan without the need for a base rate proceeding during the plan

                        under this section, the Commission shall consider whether the water or sewer utility's application, as proposed, (i) establishes rates that are fair both to the customer and to the water or sewer utility, (ii) reasonably ensures
                        the continuation of safe and reliable utility services, (iii) will not result in sudden substantial rate increases to customers annually or over the term of the plan, (iv) is representative of the utility's operations over the

                        True-Ups for Past over or Under Recoveries Not Authorized. - This section was not intended by the General Assembly to authorize true-ups for past over-recoveries or under-recoveries of fuel costs or the fuel component of purchased power of electric utilities.

                        By enacting subsection (d) of this section, the General Assembly did not modify the judicially adopted rule prohibiting retroactive rate making, heretofore extant in this State, so as to authorize the Utilities Commission to employ an Experience Modification
                        Factor in connection with an electric utility's fuel charge adjustment proceedings in order to provide for a "true-up" of the utility's past over-recoveries or under-recoveries of fuel costs. Subsection (d) does not authorize such
                        a "true-up" system. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Thornburg, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 353 S.E.2d 413 (1987).

                        From time to time, as changes in the cost of natural gas require, each natural gas local distribution company may apply to the Commission for permission to change its rates to track changes in the cost of natural gas supply and transportation. The Commission
                        may, without a hearing, issue an order allowing such rate changes to become effective simultaneously with the effective date of the change in the cost of natural gas or at any other time ordered by the Commission. If the Commission
                        has not issued an order under this subsection within 120 days after the application, the utility may place the requested rate adjustment into effect. If the rate adjustment is finally determined to be excessive or is denied, the
                        utility shall make refund of any excess, plus interest as provided in G.S. 62-130(e), to its customers in a manner ordered by the Commission. Any rate adjustment under this subsection is subject to review under subsection (c) of

                        Each natural gas local distribution company shall submit to the Commission information and data for an historical 12-month test period concerning the utility's actual cost of gas, volumes of purchased gas, sales volumes, negotiated sales volumes, and
                        transportation volumes. This information and data shall be filed on an annual basis in the form and detail and at the time required by the Commission. The Commission, upon notice and hearing, shall compare the utility's prudently
                        incurred costs with costs recovered from all the utility's customers that it served during the test period. If those prudently incurred costs are greater or less than the recovered costs, the Commission shall, subject to G.S. 62-158,
                        require the utility to refund any overrecovery by credit to bill or through a decrement in its rates and shall permit the utility to recover any deficiency through an increment in its rates. If the Commission finds the overrecovery
                        or deficiency has been or is likely to be substantially reduced, negated, or reversed before or during the period in which it would be credited or recovered, the Commission, in its discretion, may order the utility to make an appropriate

                        Any local exchange company, subject to the provisions of G.S. 62-110(f1), that is subject to rate of return regulation pursuant to G.S. 62-133 or a form of alternative regulation authorized by subsection (b) of this section may elect to have the rates,
                        terms, and conditions of its services determined pursuant to a form of price regulation, rather than rate of return or other form of earnings regulation. Under this form of price regulation, the Commission shall, among other things,
                        permit the local exchange company to determine and set its own depreciation rates, to rebalance its rates, and to adjust its prices in the aggregate, or to adjust its prices for various aggregated categories of services, based
                        upon changes in generally accepted indices of prices. Upon application, the Commission shall, after notice and an opportunity for interested parties to be heard, approve such price regulation, which may differ between local exchange
                        companies, upon finding that the plan as proposed (i) protects the affordability of basic local exchange service, as such service is defined by the Commission; (ii) reasonably assures the continuation of basic local exchange service
                        that meets reasonable service standards that the Commission may adopt; (iii) will not unreasonably prejudice any class of telephone customers, including telecommunications companies; and (iv) is otherwise consistent with the public
                        interest. Upon approval, and except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, price regulation shall thereafter be the sole form of regulation imposed upon the electing local exchange company, and the Commission shall thenceforth
                        regulate the electing local exchange company's prices, rather than its earnings. The Commission shall issue an order denying or approving the proposed plan for price regulation, with or without modification, not more than 90 days
                        from the filing of the application. However, the Commission may extend the time period for an additional 90 days at the discretion of the Commission. If the Commission approves the application with modifications, the local exchange
                        company subject to such approval may accept the modifications and implement the proposed plan as modified, or may, at its option, (i) withdraw its application and continue to be regulated under the form of regulation that existed
                        immediately prior to the filing of the application; (ii) file another proposed plan for price regulation; or (iii) file an application for a form of alternative regulation under subsection (b) of this section. If the initial price
                        regulation plan is approved with modifications and the local exchange company files another plan pursuant to part (ii) of the previous sentence, the Commission shall issue an order denying or approving the proposed plan for price
                        regulation, with or without modifications, not more than 90 days from that filing by the local exchange company.

      </b> - Session Laws 2007-397, s. 2(a), enacted this section as G.S. 62-133.7. It has been renumbered as this section at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2011-309, s. 1, provides: "Legislative Findings. - The General Assembly makes the following findings regarding the need to allow renewable energy certificates (RECs) derived from the thermal energy output of combined heat and power facilities
                    that use poultry waste as a fuel to meet the requirements of the poultry waste set-aside under G.S. 62-133.8(f) (Compliance With REPS Requirements Through the Use of Poultry Waste Resources):
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) The electric power suppliers have experienced considerable difficulty in procuring sufficient electricity derived from the use of poultry waste at a reasonable cost to meet the especially restrictive language of the poultry waste set-aside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) The public interest of the State will be served by providing a cost-effective option for the electric power suppliers to use in order to comply with the poultry waste set-aside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) The State and the public will benefit directly from reduced process steam costs to North Carolina businesses, which will help North Carolina businesses remain competitive and viable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) The State and the public will benefit directly from diversifying the State's viable generation resource options, which utilize indigenous North Carolina resources to foster development of renewable projects in the State and encourage investment in
                    new renewable projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) The health and safety of the citizens of the State will be served through improving air quality and water quality through the controlled destruction of methane, the capture of organic residuals, and addressing the very important environmental concern
                    involving the current disposal practice of land application of poultry waste, which poses an ever increasing threat of pollution and contamination of the waters of the State."

                        Electric Utility Merger Not Contrary to Public Convenience and Necessity. - Merger of electric utilities approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission (Commission) was not contrary to public convenience and necessity because (1) testimony and G.S
                        62-133.8(b) and G.S. 62-133.9(b) supported the Commission's monopsony analysis, (2) the Commission considered job losses, and (3) low-income families were not harmed.

                        Energy Efficiency Measure. - Utilities Commission erred in ruling that a topping cycle combined heat and power (CHP) system does not constitute an energy efficiency measure under G.S. 62-133.8(a)(4), except to the extent that the waste heat component
                        is used and meets the definition of an energy efficiency measure in G.S. 62-133.8(a)(4). Instead, the appellate court held that for the purposes of classifying a topping cycle CHP as an energy efficiency measure, the entire topping
                        cycle CHP system is included. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. N.C. Sustainable Energy Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 761, 803 S.E.2d 430 (2017).

                        earned by such utility upon the basis of such rates is unjust and unreasonable. In such a proceeding the burden of proof shall be upon the electrical distribution company.

                            Limits on Commission's Authority. - The Commission is a creation of the legislature and, in fixing rates to be charged by public utilities, exercises the legislative function. It has no authority except that given to it by statute. A fortiori, the Commission
                            has no authority to permit that which is forbidden by this section or to extend a previously granted rate increase which former subsection (e) declared terminated. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten,

                            applied-for rate changes to become immediately effective, conditionally or unconditionally. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 327</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 651 (1976).

                            discretion, may make the subsidiary a formal party and treat the original petition as a joint petition for a uniform system of rates; or it may make the subsidiary a party and fix proper rates for the subsidiary's exchanges

                        <p>
                            Language of Subsection (b) Is Permissive. - While the language of subsection (b) gives the Commission authority to suspend changes in rates subject to the time limitation imposed, it does not require that it do so. The language is permissive, not mandatory.
                            State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 445, 192 S.E.2d 842 (1972); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 327</cite>, 230

                        <p>
                            The power granted the Commission by subsection (b) to suspend a requested change in rates is a discretionary one which the Commission may, but need not, exercise. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C.

                            Authority to Suspend Rates for Lesser Period. - The authority to suspend rates for not more than 270 days clearly includes the power to suspend them for some lesser period. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite>                            445, 192 S.E.2d 842 (1972); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                            Power to Suspend Portion of Change for Lesser Period. - The discretionary power granted the Commission by subsection (b) to suspend a proposed change in rates for a period not longer than 270 days clearly includes the lesser power to suspend a portion
                            of the change for some lesser period. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 428, 225 S.E.2d 101, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 424</cite>, 230

                            Suspension of Rates May Be Withdrawn or Modified. - Nothing in this section indicates a legislative intent that once the Commission exercises its discretionary power and suspends rates, it thereby necessarily exhausts its authority in that regard, so
                            as thereafter to be precluded from withdrawing or modifying the suspension. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 445, 192 S.E.2d 842 (1972); State ex rel.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is entirely consistent with the statutory procedure contemplated by this section that upon the filing with the Commission by a utility of a new or revised rate, the Commission, if it exercises its discretion to suspend such rate, should (1) act promptly
                            and suspend the rate for up to the maximum period it is permitted to do so; (2) hold a preliminary hearing, if the Commission should deem this desirable, to receive additional evidence and information; and (3) in the clearer
                            light furnished by the additional information so acquired, reconsider its original order and either modify it or cancel it altogether. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite>                            445, 192 S.E.2d 842 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Implicit within the discretionary authority granted to determine whether and for how long to suspend is the discretion to cancel or modify a suspension once it has been made, and nothing in the language of this section suggests that the legislature intended
                            that the Commission could exercise the discretionary authority granted it only if it did so on an all-or-nothing, once-and-for-all basis. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 327</cite>,

         III. RATE CHANGES BASED ON FUEL COSTS UNDER FORMER SUBSECTION (E).

                            The purpose of the expedited fuel proceeding was to allow a utility to change its rates based solely on fluctuations in fuel costs. The reasonableness of the utility's based fuel costs are not to be considered. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Conservation
                            Council, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 59</cite>, 320 S.E.2d 679 (1984).

                        <p>
                            From a review of the language, purpose and history of former subsection (e), it can be concluded that the legislature intended that the Utilities Commission consider in the fuel adjustment proceedings only the fluctuations in the price of fossil fuels
                            - oil, coal and natural gas - used by the utility in the production of electric power in its own generating units. The legislature did not intend to include in the expedited hearing proceedings the myriad of issues relating
                            to purchased or interchange power which necessarily require closer scrutiny. Subsequent action by the legislature in enacting G.S. 62-133.2, which makes express provision for the consideration of such issues in the general
                            rate cases, has now made its intent clear. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Staff-North Carolina Utils. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 195</cite>, 306 S.E.2d 435 (1983).

                        <p>
                            Former subsection (e) dealt specifically with the continuation of previously granted rate increases based solely on the increased cost of fuel. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 451</cite>,
                            232 S.E.2d 184 (1977).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Former subsection (e) did not roll back electric power rates. On the contrary, it authorized the Commission, after hearing, to incorporate into the basic rates of the utility, chargeable on and after September 1, 1975, an increase determined by the then
                            cost of coal. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 451</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 184 (1977).

                        <p>
                            Heat Rate and Plant Availability Not Bases for Determination Under Former Subsection (e). - Pursuant to former subsection (e) of this section, a public utility could apply to the Utilities Commission for authority to increase its rates and charges based
                            solely upon the increased cost of fuel used in the generation of electric power, and the Commission, on its own motion or upon request of an interested rate payor, could consider and determine a decrease in rates or charges
                            based solely upon a decrease in the cost of fuel; therefore, insofar as the Commission considered and passed upon the cost of fuel used by defendant in the generation of electric power during the periods in question by considering
                            the reasonableness of the prices paid by defendant for such fuel, it acted within the scope of the statutorily prescribed procedure, but insofar as the Commission considered and based its determination upon such factors as
                            defendant's heat rate and plant availability in these proceedings, it went beyond the scope of the procedure authorized by former subsection (e). State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. VEPCO, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite>                            453, 269 S.E.2d 657, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 531</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 462 (1980).

                            Plant Efficiency Not Considered in Proceedings Under Former Subsection (e). - Heat rate and capacity factor furnish convenient measuring devices by which to evaluate the overall efficiency with which a particular electrical utility system is operated,
                            and the Utilities Commission should take into account the efficiency of a company's operation in fixing its rates in a general rate case as provided in G.S. 62-133. However, plant efficiency as it bears upon fuel cost was not
                            a factor to be considered in the limited and expedited proceeding provided for by former subsection (e) of this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                            Commission's Decision Held Improper. - Commission's "decision" that the legislature, in enacting former subsection (e), did not intend to deny the utility "recovery of its July and August 1975 fuel expenses actually incurred" was not an interpretation
                            of the statute but a nullification of it, which was beyond the authority of the Commission. The wisdom and fairness of the legislature's determination, clearly expressed, may not be reviewed by the Commission, or even by the
                            courts in the absence of a constitutional question. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 451</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 184 (1977).

                        Purpose. - This section was enacted for the purpose of minimizing the effect of the unavoidable time lag between the filing of an application by a utility company for an increase in its rates for service and the entry of an order of the Commission finding
                        such increase proper. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. VEPCO, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 398</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 283 (1974); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 327</cite>,

                        But Power Company May Not at Will Disregard Such Contract. - The mere existence in the Commission of authority to increase the rates previously specified in a municipal contract does not authorize a power company at its own will to disregard such contract
                        and to charge the other party thereto a higher rate. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. VEPCO, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 398</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 283 (1974).

                        the validity of the proposed rates and if the utility company files its undertaking, approved by the Commission, for a refund of any portion of such rates ultimately disapproved by the Commission. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                        period during which the interest of present customers has an absolute preference, a conditional preference is given to the interest of future customers by permitting the implementation of the increase subject to mandatory refund

                        a municipal corporation is not entitled to a temporary order restraining the service company from putting the rates into effect within the municipality upon the assertion that the increase in rates was contrary to contractual provisions
                        in the franchise granted the public service company by the city, since an adequate and efficient remedy is afforded the city and its inhabitants by suit upon the bond in the event the increase in rate was not justified in law,

                        The Utilities Commission exceeded its statutory authority in requiring a manufacturer to pay a surcharge for emergency natural gas used by the manufacturer prior to the date that the tariff including the surcharge became effective, even though the supplier
                        did not bill the manufacturer for such gas until after the tariff became effective. A rate is fixed or allowed when it becomes effective pursuant to G.S. 62-130(a), and rates must be fixed prospectively from their effective date.

                        order did not constitute unlawful retroactive rate making. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. North Carolina Natural Gas Corp., <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 630</cite>, 375 S.E.2d 147 (1989).

                        Former subsection (f) of G.S. 62-133 dealt only with rate changes, while subsection (c) of this section, specifically sets forth the criteria pursuant to which refunds should be distributed. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Public Serv. Co.,

                        until that time, the utilities customers have no vested interest in the refunds. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Util. Customers Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 657</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 332 (1994).

                        "Complaint Proceeding". - A hearing which involves a single rate or a small part of the rate structure of a public utility is called a "complaint proceeding." It differs from a general rate case in that it deals with an emergency or change of circumstances
                        which does not affect the entire rate structure of the utility and may be resolved without involving the procedure outlined in G.S. 62-133, and does not justify the expense and loss of time involved in such procedure. State ex

                    In setting a hearing on rates upon its own motion, upon complaint, or upon application of a public utility, the Commission shall declare the scope of the hearing by determining whether it is to be a general rate case, under G.S. 62-133, or whether it
                    is to be a case confined to the reasonableness of a specific single rate, a small part of the rate structure, or some classification of users involving questions which do not require a determination of the entire rate structure and
                    overall rate of return. The procedures established in this section shall not be required when pricing alternatives permitted under G.S. 62-134(h) and (j) are adopted.

                        This section is inapplicable to proceedings conducted under G.S. 62-90(c), since their scope is limited by statute to the exceptions on which the particular appeal of a final order or decision is based, leaving the Commission without authority to declare
                        such a hearing a general rate case or complaint proceeding. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 598</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 862 (1978).

                        The question of whether a case "is to be a general rate case" under the terms of this section is a mixed question of law and fact. As to such questions, courts should be hesitant to disturb the commission's expert determination with regard to the nature
                        of the case presented, particularly when its determination is made prior to hearing and for the initial purpose of setting the scope of the hearing and the resulting amount of information which the public utility will be required
                        to furnish. Even at that stage, however, the commission's determination must be supported by "competent, material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted." State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Rail Common Carriers,

                        Tax Reform Benefits Passed on to Ratepayers by Rule Making Rather Than Rate Making Procedure. - Utilities Commission may pass on to the ratepayers the benefits of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA-86) through a rule making procedure rather than a rate making
                        procedure. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 190</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 118 (1990).

                        242 S.E.2d 862 (1978) does not approve the rule making process for the purpose of adjusting rates, nor is there any statutory authority for the proposition that rates may be adjusted by some other method beyond those set out in

                        Assurance of Equal Service as Basis for Regulation. - A fundamental basis for the regulation of public utilities is to assure that once monopoly powers have been granted, the utility will provide all of its customers similarly situated with service on
                        a reasonably equal basis. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. City of Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 640</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 786 (1960).

                        utilities, or under this section which prohibits a utility from receiving more compensation for services than the amount prescribed by the Commission. Blue Ridge Textile Printers, Inc. v. Public Serv. Co.,

                        Telephone Company Proscribed from Furnishing Free Service, etc., to Municipalities. - The Utilities Commission properly proscribes a telephone company from furnishing service to certain municipalities within its territory free or at a reduced rate, and
                        contractual agreements of a telephone company to do so in consideration for franchise rights to use the streets, alleys and roads in such municipalities for its pole line and underground conduits are void, since such concessions
                        constitute discrimination against other customers similarly situated. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. City of Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 640</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 786 (1960).

        Electric Rate Based on Old Contract Upheld.
       </b> - Where, at the termination of a contract between city and electric company, city officials were doubtful whether it would be advantageous to adopt the new schedule of the electric company, and elected to take current
                        on basis from month to month, it was held that the electric company was not exacting an unlawful rate by billing the city for current on rates contained in the old contract rather than under the new schedule. City of High Point

                        Freight Rates Need Not Be Same for Both Directions. - In shipments to a great distance, special circumstances, such as flow of traffic, may justify a higher rate between two points in one direction than in the opposite; and in an action for recovery of
                        the penalty for excessive freight rates, it was error for the judgment below in effect to charge the jury that such tariff rate published between the two points for freight moving in an opposite direction to that of the shipment
                        in question was conclusive, and that they should be governed in their verdict as to the overcharge accordingly. James H. Scull &amp; Co. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 180</cite>, 56

                        Freight Charge on Undelivered Shipment. - Where defendant collected freight charges, for an entire shipment, as invoiced and originally billed, and the sum of 96 cents was paid as freight on that part of the shipment which was "short" and not delivered,
                        this was an overcharge; failure to refund such overcharge after the 60 days allowed for investigation rendered defendant liable for the statutory penalty. Cottrell v. Railroad, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 383</cite>,

                        Collection of Surcharge Before Tariff Became Effective. - The Utilities Commission exceeded its statutory authority in requiring a manufacturer to pay a surcharge for emergency natural gas used by the manufacturer prior to the date that the tariff including
                        the surcharge became effective, even though the supplier did not bill the manufacturer for such gas until after the tariff became effective. A rate is fixed or allowed when it becomes effective pursuant to G.S. 62-130(a) and rates
                        must be fixed prospectively from their effective date. G.S. 62-136(a) provides that the commission shall determine rates to be thereafter observed and in force. The commission may not fix rates retroactively so as to make them
                        collectible for past services. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Farmers Chem. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 257 S.E.2d 439 (1979), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 124</cite>,

                        Penalty Enforceable Though Charges Small. - The penalty fixed by former G.S. 60-110 to enforce the duty of a carrier in regard to proper charges for transporting freight and refund of overcharges, which penalty could not in any event exceed $100.00, was
                        enforceable for a default established against defendant, even though the particular transportation charges might appear disproportionately small. It is on failure to return small amounts wrongfully overcharged that penalties are
                        especially required. In large matters the claimant can better afford the cost of litigation. Efland v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 129</cite>, 59 S.E. 359 (1907).

                    <p>
                        Recovery of Excess Caused by Error in Tariff Distance Table. - Where carriers charged rates in accordance with the published tariffs on file, but because of error in the tariff distance table the charges were excessive, the shippers could recover the
                        excess charged by petition before the Utilities Commission, the remedy by civil action under former G.S. 60-110, 62-138 and this section to recover overcharges and penalties being the proper remedy only when the charges were collected
                        in excess of the published tariffs. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Norfolk S. Ry., <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 477</cite>, 106 S.E.2d 681 (1959).

                    <p>
                        Agent as Party Aggrieved. - Where, under agreement with his principal, the agent of a manufacturer was obligated to pay the freight charges on shipments made to him, and upon demand of the carrier he paid its unlawful charges on a shipment, he was the
                        party aggrieved, and could maintain his action to recover the excess, and also the penalty when settlement was not made within 60 days. Tilley v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 363</cite>,
                        90 S.E. 309 (1916).

                    <p>
                        What Demand Must Specify. - Where carrier demanded and received an unlawful freight charge for a shipment, and the party aggrieved made written demand of the carrier for payment of the overcharge, as required by the statute, it was not necessary, in order
                        to maintain an action for the penalty imposed upon the carrier failing to settle in 60 days, that the written demand specify the penalty, or that demand therefor be made in the justice's court or alleged in the complaint filed
                        on appeal therefrom. Tilley v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 363</cite>, 90 S.E. 309 (1916).

                    <p>
                        Separate Demands in Same Envelope. - The mere fact that plaintiff enclosed separate written demands in the same envelope, and gave an aggregate amount thereof, in a letter accompanying them, did not affect the demands, when the overcharges were separate
                        and distinct, demand was made specifically as to each and was accompanied separately with the paid freight bill and duplicate bill of lading, and each demand was complete in itself; such was a compliance with the provisions of
                        the statute. Efland v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 129</cite>, 59 S.E. 359 (1907).

                    <p>
                        Overcharge was Wilful. - Trial court properly ordered campground owners to pay tenants $ 10.00 per day for every day between 2 December 2005 and 16 October 2006 as a penalty for overcharges, as provided for in G.S. 62-139(b). The owners were a public
                        utility and their action in overcharging tenants was wilful. Shepard v. Bonita Vista Props., L.P., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 614, 664 S.E.2d 388 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 252</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Burden of Proving Overcharge. - The burden is upon the plaintiff to show that a freight rate charged and collected by a carrier was in excess of its tariff required of the carrier to be published, when he seeks to recover this excess and the statutory
                        penalty; hence, where the shipment was routed over one line of connecting carriers and the tariff filed by the carrier over another route was shown, no evidence was afforded as to the rate of the actual route of the shipment, and,
                        in the absence of further evidence, a judgment as of nonsuit was proper. Blalock Hdwe. Co. v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 395</cite>, 86 S.E. 1025 (1915).

                            The obligation of a public service corporation to serve impartially and without unjust discrimination is fundamental. It is not essential that consumers who are charged different rates for service should be competitors in order to invoke this principle.
                            There must be substantial differences in service or conditions to justify differences in rates. There must be no unreasonable discrimination between those receiving the same kind and degree of service. State ex rel. Utils.

                            A common carrier is guilty of unlawful discrimination, by the principles of the common law and the terms of the statute, when it charges one person, for service rendered, a larger sum than is charged another person for like service under substantially

                            Commission's approval of a gas company's bifurcated full-margin pricing mechanism, which essentially resulted in sales customers, rather than transportation customers, paying duplicate charges for interstate transportation.

                        Carriers have legal right to contract inter se, and the law encourages cooperation and agreements between them respecting their service to the public. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 384</cite>,

                        Former subsection (c) of this section encouraged cooperation and agreements between common carriers respecting their service to the public. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 43</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Duty to Establish Joint Rates and Divide Revenues. - Motor carriers of freight in intrastate commerce who exchange freight in the course of delivery are not only given authority to establish joint rates, but are required to do so, and to provide for the
                        division of revenues derived from such shipments by contract, subject only to the limitation that the contract shall not unduly prefer or prejudice any of the participating carriers. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Thurston Motor
                        Lines, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 166</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 404 (1954).

                    <p>
                        Authority of Commission to Interfere with Division of Revenue from Interchanged Freight. - The Utilities Commission is given authority to intervene and vacate a contract for division of revenue from interchanged freight between two intrastate motor carriers
                        only upon finding after hearing that the contractual agreement between the carriers for the division of revenue from such shipments is, or will be, unjust, unreasonable and inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial as
                        between the contracting carriers, and when an order is entered by the Commission without such jurisdictional finding, the cause must be remanded. A finding merely that the Commission does not accept the contractual practice of
                        the carriers as being equitable is insufficient. And the provision of subsection (d), giving the Commission discretionary power to prohibit the establishment of joint rates, is inapplicable. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Thurston
                        Motor Lines, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 166</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 404 (1954).

                    <p>
                        Mileage alone is not a sufficient basis for the determination of intrastate rates by the Utilities Commission, but the Commission must consider all factors involved in rate making, including competition from interstate carriers, the different modes of
                        transportation, the topography and volume of business as affecting costs, etc. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. North Carolina Motor Carriers Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 432</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 271

                        An operating ratio of 100% means that for every dollar of freight revenue received, the carrier spends a dollar in operating expenses. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Attorney Gen., <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite>                        657, 163 S.E.2d 638 (1968); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Motor Carriers' Traffic Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C.

                    <p>
                        Lower Operating Ratios Indicative of More Profitable Operations. - When the operating ratio exceeds 100%, it means that the expenses exceed the revenues. The lower the operating ratio, the more profitable the operation is to the carrier. State ex rel.
                        N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Attorney Gen., <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 163 S.E.2d 638 (1968).

                    <p>
                        Basis for Determination of Ratios. - A determination of intrastate operating ratios must be based on revenues and expenses incurred in North Carolina alone; where ratios do not reflect an actual separation of intrastate and interstate revenues and expenses,
                        a rate increase based thereon cannot be sustained. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Motor Carriers' Traffic Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 515, 192 S.E.2d 580 (1972).

                        The operating ratios for the movement of tobacco in intrastate traffic cannot be determined with mathematical exactitude. But the carriers can no doubt approximate the rateable proportion of their operating ratios from tobacco movements in intrastate
                        traffic and offer evidence of other facts and circumstances in respect thereto sufficient in probative force to enable the Commission to make findings of fact and to issue such orders as the findings of fact may warrant. State

                        utility for purposes of rate making, so long as the Commission determines in the rate making procedure that the agreements between the utility and the affiliated corporations are just and reasonable and it does not appear that
                        their purpose is to conceal or divert profits from the public utility to an affiliate. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Intervenor Residents, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 222, 278 S.E.2d 761 (1981),

                        the Commission authorizing such issue. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 714, 207 S.E.2d 771 (1974), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 201</cite>,

                        Any common carrier violating any of the provisions of this section shall forfeit to the party aggrieved the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) for the first day and one dollar ($1.00) for each succeeding day of such unlawful detention or neglect, but the forfeiture
                        shall not be collected for a period exceeding 30 days.

                        In reckoning what is a reasonable time for such transportation, it shall be considered that such common carrier has transported household goods within a reasonable time if it has done so in the ordinary time required for transporting such articles by
                        similar carriers between the receiving and shipping stations. The Commission is authorized to establish reasonable times for transportation by the various modes of carriage which shall be held to be prima facie reasonable, and
                        a failure to transport within such times shall be held prima facie unreasonable. This section shall be construed to refer not only to delay in starting the household goods from the station where they are received, but to require
                        the delivery at their destination within the time specified: Provided, that if such delay shall be due to causes which could not in the exercise of ordinary care have been foreseen or which were unavoidable, then upon the establishment
                        of these facts to the satisfaction of the court trying the cause, the defendant common carrier shall be relieved from any penalty for delay in the transportation of household goods, but it shall not be relieved from the costs of
                        such action. In all actions to recover penalties against a common carrier under this section, the burden of proof shall be upon such carrier to show where the delay, if any, occurred. The penalties provided in this section shall
                        be in addition to the damages recoverable for failure to transport within a reasonable time.

                        Penalty Not Applicable to Interstate Shipments. - A penalty may not be recovered of the carrier of an interstate shipment for negligent delay in transportation under this section. Bivens Bros. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 414</cite>,

                        A penalty cannot be recovered for the failure of a railroad company to transport freight within a reasonable time when the initial and terminal points are within the State, but the shipment necessarily passes into another state in transit. Such is interstate
                        commerce and cannot be interfered with by the State. Shelby Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 66</cite>, 60 S.E. 721 (1908).

                        "Ordinary Time" a Jury Question. - The question of "ordinary time" for the transportation of freight by the carrier, in a suit for a penalty for failure to transport, is a question of fact for the jury. Shelby Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Southern Ry.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 66</cite>, 60 S.E. 721 (1908); Wall-Huske Co. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 407</cite>, 61 S.E. 277 (1908).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an action for the recovery of a penalty, it was for the jury to find what was "ordinary" time, under the surrounding circumstances, and whether the defendant transported freight within such time, as well as the amount of recovery. It is error for the
                        trial court to instruct the jury that if they believe the evidence they should answer the issue in a certain way or in a sum certain. Davis v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 68</cite>, 60 S.E.
                        722 (1908).

                    <p>
                        Burden of Proof Where Time Prima Facie Reasonable. - When the evidence discloses that the time taken by the railroad company for transporting goods, etc., was prima facie reasonable as fixed by the statute, the question of reasonable time is one for the
                        jury to measure by the statutory standard, the burden of proof being upon the plaintiff. Alexander v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 93</cite>, 56 S.E. 697 (1907).

                    <p>
                        How Unreasonableness of Time May Be Shown. - In an action to recover the penalty, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that the carrier failed to transport and deliver the goods within a reasonable time, which is defined to be the "ordinary
                        time" required to transport and deliver. This may be shown by proving the distance over which the goods are to be transported and the time consumed therein. From this evidence the jury may, as a matter of common knowledge and observation,
                        draw the conclusion whether, in view of the usual speed of freight trains, the time consumed, the distance, and other conditions, the carrier has failed to transport and deliver within a reasonable time. Jenkins v. Southern Ry.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 178</cite>, 59 S.E. 663 (1907).

                    <p>
                        Over 21 Days to Transport Articles 58 Miles. - Where it was admitted that certain articles were received by defendant to be transported and delivered to plaintiff, the place of shipment and destination both being in the State, 58 miles apart, with but
                        one intermediate point between them, and that the articles were not delivered to plaintiff within 21 days, the delay was unreasonable. Watson v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 236</cite>,
                        59 S.E. 55 (1907).

                    <p>
                        Twelve Days to Transport Shipment 25 Miles. - When there was evidence that it took 12 days to transport a certain shipment from one station to another only 25 miles away, on the same railroad, the jury would be permitted, from their common observation
                        and experience, to consider and determine the question of ordinary time between the two points, and, in the absence of explanation by defendant, fix the amount of wrongful delay. Rollins v. Seaboard Air Line Ry.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 153</cite>, 59 S.E. 671 (1907).

                        For cases construing former provision making delay of two days at initial point and 48 hours at one intermediate point for each 100 miles prima facie reasonable, see Meredith v. Railroad Co., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 478</cite>,
                        50 S.E. 1 (1905); Davis &amp; Hooks v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 207</cite>, 59 S.E. 53 (1907); Watson v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 236</cite>, 59 S.E. 55 (1907); Jenkins v. Southern

                    <p>
                        Negligent Default in Delivery to Consignee. - Former similar section extended the penalty to cases of negligent default in the carrier's making delivery of the freight to the consignee. Mitchell v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 162</cite>,
                        110 S.E. 859 (1922), decided prior to 1907 amendment including such delays, see Alexander v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 93</cite>, 56 S.E. 697 (1907).

                    <p>
                        When Transportation Ceases. - Transportation ceases when the duty of the carrier as a warehouseman commences, and in respect to freight transported in carload lots, when the car reaches its destination and is placed for unloading. What particular parts
                        of the carrier's tracks and freight yards may be used for such purposes must of necessity be left to its discretion, but the car must be reasonably accessible and placed for delivery before transportation is fully ended. Brooks
                        Mfg. Co. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 665</cite>, 68 S.E. 243 (1910).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Former section did not apply to a delivery on the private tracks of a consignee, but to avoid the penalty it was required of the carrier to place for delivery a carload shipment on its track at destination at a place reasonably accessible. Brooks Mfg.
                        Co. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 665</cite>, 68 S.E. 243 (1910).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transportation does not cease when a carload is placed by the carrier within the yard limits of the point of destination. Wall-Huske Co. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 407</cite>, 61 S.E. 277 (1908).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Duty to Notify Consignee. - Where a shipment of goods is delivered to a railroad company for transportation, the title vests in the consignee, with the duty resting upon the carrier on the arrival of the goods at destination to notify the consignee and
                        make delivery. This principle applied to a side-station when notification of arrival should have been given from a nearby station, and the inquiring consignee was there misinformed as to the arrival, and the car in the meanwhile
                        was broken into and the shipment stolen. Acme Mfg. Co. v. Tucker, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 303</cite>, 111 S.E. 525 (1922).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Goods Travel over Several Lines. - When the initial carrier delivers goods to its connecting carrier for further transportation to their destination, and an unreasonable delay occurs, without evidence as to which carrier was responsible for the delay,
                        the defendant, the initial carrier, is liable for the entire delay, the burden of proof being upon it as the party having the evidence peculiarly within its own knowledge or possession. Watson v. Atlantic C.L.R.R.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 236</cite>, 59 S.E. 55 (1907).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where an intrastate shipment of goods is transported over connecting lines to its destination, it is proper for the trial court to make both roads parties to an action to recover the penalty for the failure to transport safely and within a reasonable
                        time, the burden being upon each defendant to show that it had not failed in its duty. Sellars Hosiery Mills v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 449</cite>, 93 S.E. 952 (1917).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Who Is "Party Aggrieved". - The plaintiff is entitled to recover the penalty as the "party aggrieved," for defendant's wrongfully failing to transport freight within a reasonable time, where the facts show that, from the attendant circumstances or terms
                        of the agreement, he is the one whose legal right is denied and who is alone interested in having the transportation properly made. Cardwell v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 218</cite>, 59
                        S.E. 673 (1907).

                    <p>
                        When the consignor ships goods to be sold for his own benefit, he is the "party aggrieved," and the proper party plaintiff. Robertson v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. 323</cite>, 62 S.E. 413 (1908).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The plaintiff could maintain his action against the defendant railroad company for wrongful failure to transport certain goods received by the latter, and bill of lading issued by it to plaintiff, when it appeared that plaintiff shipped the goods to be
                        sold for his benefit by the consignee, and that the plaintiff was the one who alone acquired the right to demand the service to be rendered by the defendant, and was the party aggrieved. Rollins v. Seaboard Air Line Ry.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 153</cite>, 59 S.E. 671 (1907).

                    <p>
                        Consignor as Party Aggrieved Where Goods Not to Be Paid for Until Delivery. - When the consignor had agreed with the consignee that the latter was only required to pay for the intrastate shipment when it reached its destination, the consignor could maintain
                        his action for delay in transit, as the party aggrieved. Davis v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 68</cite>, 60 S.E. 722 (1908).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Vendor as Aggrieved Party. - When by the contract or agreement between a vendor and vendee of goods, the goods were to be "received, inspected and weighed" by the vendee before any part of the purchase price was payable, the title did not vest in the
                        vendee, and the vendor was the "party aggrieved." Elliott v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. 235</cite>, 71 S.E. 339 (1911).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Defendant's Knowledge of Who Is Aggrieved Party Immaterial. - When it is shown that the plaintiff is the "party aggrieved," it is of no importance and bears in no way on the justice of plaintiff's demand or of defendant's obligation, whether defendant
                        knew who was the party aggrieved, either at the inception of the matter or at any other time. Rollins v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 153</cite>, 59 S.E. 671 (1907).

                    <p>
                        The real "party aggrieved" is entitled to recover the penalty, irrespective of the question of knowledge of or notice to the defendant. Cardwell v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 218</cite>, 59 S.E. 673 (1907).

                    <p>
                        Action Not Brought "on Relation of State". - The action for penalty is given directly to the party aggrieved, and is not required to be brought "on relation of the State." If it were, failure to bring the action in such form would be a mere informality,
                        which could be remedied by amendment. Robertson v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. 323</cite>, 62 S.E. 413 (1908).

                    <p>
                        Joinder of Actions. - An action for damages against a carrier for a lost shipment, and one for the penalty for unreasonable delay, do not merge into each other. They arise on contract and may be joined in the same action. Robertson v. Atlantic C.L.R.R.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. 323</cite>, 62 S.E. 413 (1908).

                    <p>
                        Burden of Proof as to Destruction of Goods. - The burden of proof is on the carrier to show that it is relieved of the penalty because the goods were burned, stolen or destroyed. A showing that the goods were placed in defendant's car by the initial carrier
                        and that search had been made therefor, and the absence of evidence that the goods had since been seen, was no evidence that they were burned, stolen or destroyed. Robertson v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. 323</cite>,
                        62 S.E. 413 (1908).

                    <p>
                        When Bill of Lading Not Presumptive Evidence. - When it was the consignor's duty to load a car for shipment, which had been placed at its mill by the carrier, and the carrier's agent gave a bill of lading upon the statement of the consignor that the car
                        had been loaded, without being required to verify the statement, the bill of lading was not presumptive evidence of the receipt of the contents of the car, and the question was an open one for the jury in a suit by the consignee
                        for the penalty for failure to deliver. Peele v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 390</cite>, 63 S.E. 66 (1908).

                    <p>
                        Motion for Nonsuit Properly Denied. - Where a shipment of various articles was transported by the carrier to destination, and all were received by the consignee, except one of them, which was missing and remained in the carrier's warehouse beyond the
                        statutory reasonable time, a motion for nonsuit was properly denied. Mitchell v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 162</cite>, 110 S.E. 859 (1922).

                        Verdict Incomplete. - Where it was established by the jury that a consignment of goods was carried to the delivering point by the carrier, which failed to deliver to the consignee, or to notify him, and the goods were lost while in its possession, the
                        verdict was incomplete where there was no issue submitted as to whether the carrier, which was a party to the action, was in default in not delivering the goods to the consignee. Acme Mfg. Co. v. Tucker,

                        Delivery of Baggage to Carrier. - To fix the responsibility for lost baggage upon a railroad company, either as a common carrier or warehouseman, a delivery, actual or constructive, including an acceptance by the company, is necessary; and when baggage
                        is taken by others to the station, and to places where baggage is usually received, some kind of notice must be given to the agent authorized to receive it. Williams v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. 260</cite>,

                        The requisites of the general rule requiring delivery of baggage of a passenger to a railroad company in order to hold the company liable may become modified by a custom of the latter to consider and treat baggage as received when left at a given place,

                        Effect of Stipulations Attempting to Limit Liability. - Stipulations upon a railroad ticket, limiting the liability of the carrier in a specified sum "unless a greater value has been declared by the owner and excess charge paid thereon at the time of
                        taking passage," and similar provisions in a bill of lading for the transportation of freight, are void as an attempt on the part of the carrier to contract against its own negligence. Cooper v. Norfolk S.R.R.,

                        are not properly such, it will be liable for their loss or for damage to them, though it may have been without any fault. Trouser Co. v. Railroad, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 382</cite>, 51 S.E. 973 (1905).

                        a common carrier ceases, and it is thereafter liable only as a warehouseman, and bound to the use of ordinary care. Trouser Co. v. Railroad, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 382</cite>, 51 S.E. 973 (1905).

                    <p>
                        Liability When Passenger Not Carried. - When there is no partnership arrangement between connecting lines of railroads, and a passenger buys a through ticket from a carrier to his destination on a connecting line, checks his trunk through to his destination
                        and voluntarily returns to the starting point without going upon the road of the connecting lines, the latter carrier is not liable as insurer of the contents of the trunk from larceny by reason of taking the trunk to its destination,
                        storing it there in its baggage room until its return is requested and then forwarding it to the junctional point, without compensation. Kindley v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 207</cite>,
                        65 S.E. 897 (1909).

                        Liability When Baggage Not on Same Train. - The passenger's right to a limited amount of baggage as a part of the consideration for the price of his ticket is upon condition that the baggage accompany the passenger on the same train; and where, without
                        any default on the part of the carrier, its agent, without further charge, has the baggage forwarded on a later train, the carrier's liability is not that of an insurer, but of a gratuitous bailee, under the rule of the prudent
                        man, and attaches only in instances of gross negligence. Perry v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 158</cite>, 88 S.E. 156 (1916).

                            Penalty Inapplicable to Interstate Shipments. - The entire regulation of interstate commerce is under federal control, and the penalty provided for by former provision similar to subsection (c) of this section for failure of a carrier to pay a claim in
                            the time prescribed does not apply to interstate shipments. See Morphis v. Southern Express Co., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 139</cite>, 83 S.E. 1 (1914).

                            Action May Be Brought in Contract or Tort. - A person who has sustained injuries by reason of the failure of a railroad company to provide proper means of transportation or operate its trains may bring an action on contract, or in tort, independent of
                            the statute. Purcell v. Richmond &amp; D.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 414</cite>, 12 S.E. 954 (1891), overruled on other grounds, Hansley v. Jamesville &amp; W.R. Co., 20 S.E. 528 (1894);

                            Parol Agreement to Reship Sufficient. - When a carrier has received goods for transportation over its own and a connecting line which were not delivered, and upon consignor's parol request it has them reshipped to the initial or starting point, the latter
                            agreement for reshipment, though resting in parol, is sufficient in an action for damages to the goods occurring while in the carrier's possession. Lyon v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 143</cite>,

                            Carrier Cannot Contract Against Own Negligence. - A common carrier may relieve itself from liability as an insurer upon a contract reasonable in its terms and founded upon a valuable consideration, but it cannot so limit its responsibility for loss or
                            damage resulting from its negligence. Mitchell v. Carolina Cent. R.R., <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 236</cite>, 32 S.E. 671 (1899); Everett v. Railroad, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 68</cite>,

                            Owner Cannot Generally Refuse Damaged Goods. - Damage to a shipment of goods by a railroad company, caused by the carrier's negligence, does not justify the owner in refusing to accept them on that account, unless the damages are sufficient to render
                            the goods practically worthless. He must accept the goods and sue for the damages upon the refusal of the carrier to pay them. Whittington v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 501</cite>,

                            Duty Assumed by Carrier. - Where a carrier accepts goods for transportation, in the absence of a special contract, it assumes the duty of safely carrying, within a reasonable time, the goods to the end of its line, and delivering them in like condition
                            to the connecting carrier. Meredith v. Railroad Co., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 478</cite>, 50 S.E. 1 (1905).

                            Burden of Proof as to Safe Delivery. - On proof that a carrier received goods in good condition, the burden of proof rests upon such carrier to show delivery in the same condition to the next carrier or to the consignee, such proof being peculiarly within
                            its power. Meredith v. Railroad Co., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 478</cite>, 50 S.E. 1 (1905).

                            Admissibility of Evidence as to Condition of Freight. - To show that freight was in good condition when it was delivered by the defendant to a connecting line, evidence that it was the custom of agents of such lines to examine freights before receiving
                            them, and if found in good condition to forward them, and that such examination was made and forwarding was done, was admissible. Knott v. Raleigh &amp; G.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 73</cite>,

                            Prima Facie Case. - Where a shipment of goods is received by the consignee from the final carrier in bad condition, and there is evidence that this carrier received the goods from its connecting carrier in good condition, a prima facie case of negligence
                            is made out against the delivering carrier, and presents sufficient evidence thereof to be submitted to the jury, with the burden of proof on it. Lyon v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 143</cite>,

                            Presumption of Damage. - Among connecting lines of railway, that one in whose hands goods are found damaged is presumed to have caused the damage, and the burden is upon it to rebut the presumption. Morganton Mfg. Co. v. Ohio River &amp; Charleston Ry.,

                            Goods Found Damaged at Destination. - When goods are shipped over several connecting lines of carriers and are found in a damaged condition at destination, there is a rebuttable presumption that the injury was negligently inflicted by the last carrier.

                            Liability for Negligence of Connecting Carrier. - A railroad company whose line is one of several connecting roads between places from and to which freight is shipped, in the absence of a special contract, or proof of copartnership by which each of the
                            connecting lines will become liable for the contracts of the others, is not responsible for damages for negligence occurring beyond its terminus. Knott v. Raleigh &amp; G.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 73</cite>,

                            Where two or more common carriers unite in forming an association creating a through line for the transportation of freight, payment of tariff charges to be made at the beginning or end of the transportation, with through bills of lading, the freight
                            charges to be divided according to the respective mileage of the companies, they become a copartnership and each line is liable for any damage resulting from delay or otherwise on any part of the through line, notwithstanding
                            a provision in the bill of lading that each company shall be liable only for loss or damage occurring on its own line. Rocky Mount Mills v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 693</cite>,

                            Effect of Court Order Relieving Initial Carrier. - While the initial carrier may also be held liable for damages to a shipment made over connecting lines, a direction of the court relieving it from liability does not necessarily relieve the carrier whose
                            negligence caused the damages. Gilikin v. Norfolk S.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 137</cite>, 93 S.E. 469 (1917).

                            prevent the State court from requiring the carriers to show which is responsible for the damage. Aydlett v. Norfolk S.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 47</cite>, 89 S.E. 1000 (1916).

                            Filing of Claim Prerequisite to Penalty. - A consignor of a shipment of goods is required to file his claim with the agent of the common carrier at the point of its origin, and this he must have done to maintain his action against the carrier for the
                            penalty prescribed for its failure to settle for its loss, or damage thereto, within 90 days. Hamlet Grocery Co. v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 241</cite>, 87 S.E. 57 (1915).

                            In order to recover the penalty, the consignee must file his claim with the agent as the statute directs, and the filing thereof with another of the carrier's agents is insufficient. B.F. Eagles Co. v. East Carolina Ry.,

                            Regulation of Time of Filing by Carrier. - A stipulation in a bill of lading denying the carrier's liability for damages unless written notice of such claim be filed within a specified period is in derogation of the common law, and while it will be upheld
                            if reasonable, the burden of proof is on the carrier to show that it is. Phillips v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 86</cite>, 89 S.E. 1057 (1916).

                            An allowance of 60 days is reasonable, but 30 days is unreasonable. Gwyn Harper Mfg. Co. v. Carolina Cent. R.R., <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 280</cite>, 38 S.E. 894 (1901).

                            Waiver of Stipulation. - The stipulation in a livestock bill of lading requiring that notice in writing be given the carrier's agent at destination of claim for damages to the animals shipped before they were removed or mingled with other animals, could
                            be waived by the carrier's agent at the delivering point. T.W. Newborn &amp; Co. v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 205</cite>, 87 S.E. 37 (1915).

                            Filing Claim by Mail. - The essential things necessary for the proper filing of the claim against the common carrier for damages, and for the penalty, being its delivery to and acceptance by the carrier's designated agent, such filing is not restricted
                            to its manual delivery, but the same may be done through the agency of the United States mail. The delivery of the mail will be presumed. B.F. Eagles Co. v. East Carolina Ry., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 66</cite>,

                            Notice to Negligent Connecting Carrier. - Where the second carrier in the connected line of shipment causes damages to the shipment by improperly loading it, it may not defeat an action to recover such damages, when the required notice within four months
                            has been filed with and accepted without comment by it, on the ground that such notice had not been filed with the initial or final carrier under the terms of the contract of carriage. The doctrine of notice to the agent is
                            applicable here. Aydlett v. Norfolk S.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 47</cite>, 89 S.E. 1000 (1916).

                            Notice as to Interstate Shipments. - The federal statutes, while recognizing the right of the carrier to stipulate for the filing of claims within a reasonable period, provide that if loss or damage is due to a delay in transit by negligence, no notice
                            shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery. Mann v. Fairfield &amp; Elizabeth City Transp. Co., <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 104</cite>, 96 S.E. 731 (1918).

                            Who May Bring Action. - Ordinarily the title to a shipment of goods by common carrier passes to the consignee upon acceptance by the carrier, and he may sue for damages thereto in transit; but when it is shown that the consignee refused to accept the
                            damaged goods, and that the sale was cancelled by consent, the consignor may maintain his action against the carrier for damages. Aydlett v. Norfolk S.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 47</cite>,

                            Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 224</cite>, 80 S.E. 242 (1913).

                            Separate and Distinct Issues. - In an action against a railroad company to recover damages to a shipment of goods and the penalty for the failure of defendant to pay the same within 90 days, the issues raised are entirely separate and distinct from each
                            other, and the trial judge may set aside the verdict on the second issue, and retain that on the first one, for a retrial. Hussey v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 7</cite>, 110

                            Plaintiff Must Prove Failure to Settle. - The burden is on plaintiff to show that the common carrier has failed to settle his claim in 90 days, after written demand under statutory provisions, and the prima facie case made out by showing the unreasonable
                            delay in the delivery of the shipment is not sufficient. Watkins v. American Ry. Express Co., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 605</cite>, 130 S.E. 305 (1925).

                            Burden on Carrier When Prima Facie Case Made. - In cases of limited liability, proof of shipment and loss or injury makes a prima facie case for the shipper, and then the burden is upon the carrier to show that the circumstances of the loss bring it within
                            the excepted causes; when this is shown, the burden still rests upon the carrier of showing that the loss or injury was not due to its own negligence. Mitchell v. Carolina Cent. R.R., <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 236</cite>,

                            the penalty in such suits is not lost by accepting settlement for damages for the full amount claimed after the penalty accrues. Rabon v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 59</cite>,

                            workmen employed by the plaintiff were forced to remain idle, though under pay of plaintiff, the measure of plaintiff's damages was the interest on the unemployed capital, the wages paid to its workmen and such other costs
                            and expenses incurred by plaintiff in consequence of the delay. Rocky Mount Mills v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 693</cite>, 25 S.E. 854 (1896).

                <p>
                    In addition to the declaration of policy set forth in G.S. 62-2 of Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.062.html" target="_blank">Chapter 62</a></cite>, it is declared the policy of the State of North Carolina
                    to preserve and continue all motor carrier transportation services now afforded this State; and to provide fair and impartial regulations of motor carriers in the use of the public highways in such a manner as to promote, in the interest
                    of the public, the inherent advantages of highway transportation; to promote and preserve adequate economical and efficient service to all the communities of the State by motor carriers; to encourage and promote harmony among all carriers
                    and to prevent discrimination, undue preferences or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices between all carriers; to foster a coordinated statewide motor carrier service; and to conform with the national transportation
                    policy and the federal motor carriers acts insofar as the same may be practical and adequate for application to intrastate commerce. The provisions of this section and these policies are applicable to bus companies and their rates
                    and services only to the extent with which they are consistent with the provisions of G.S. 62-259.1 and of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1985.

                <p>
                    The transportation of passengers, their baggage and express, by bus companies has become increasingly subject to competition from other forms of transportation which are unregulated or only partially regulated as to rates and services. It is in the public
                    interest and it is the policy of this State that bus companies be partially deregulated so that they may rely upon competitive market forces to determine the best quality, variety and price of bus services, thereby promoting the public
                    health, safety and welfare by strengthening and increasing the viability of this necessary form of transportation.

                        Any provisions with respect to rates and services contained in a franchise contract between a utilities company and a municipal corporation, authorizing the utilities company to transport passengers over its streets, are subject to the orders of the Utilities

                        Dispute as to Curtailment of Services by Bus Carrier. - Where a municipality has granted a franchise to a utilities company to operate passenger buses over its streets, the parties may mutually agree upon extensions and services, changes in routes, or
                        curtailment of services, when in the opinion of the governing board of the municipality such changes are, under the existing conditions, for the best interest of all concerned, including the public. However, when the parties are
                        unable to agree to a proposed curtailment of existing services, the matter is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Utilities Commission and the municipality may not enjoin the utility from the proposed curtailment of services,
                        although the utility may not change its schedules or curtail its services unless given authority to do so by the Utilities Commission. City of Winston-Salem v. Winston-Salem City Coach Lines, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 179</cite>,

                        No Territorial Limitations on Intracity Carrier When Subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(6) Apply. - An exempted intracity carrier under subdivision (a)(8) has no territorial limitations as to the transportation of passengers under subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(6)
                        of this section, where the request for such services arises within the area for which such carrier holds a certificate of exemption from the Commission and a franchise from the municipality in which it operates or within any additional
                        zone or zones adjacent thereto which have been fixed by the Commission. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. McKinnon, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 1</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 134 (1961).

                        Operations Devoted Exclusively to Transportation of Employees to and from Work. - The North Carolina Utilities Commission does not have regulatory supervision of operations devoted exclusively to the transportation by motor vehicle of the bona fide employees
                        of industrial plants to and from the places of their employment, even in cases where the persons conducting such operations are engaged at the same time or at other times in carrying on the callings of common carriers by motor

                        Transportation to and from Federal Military Reservation. - Carriers in intrastate commerce transporting passengers for hire to and from federal military reservations or bases are exempted from regulation of the Utilities Commission only if such carriers
                        have been procured by the United States government to carry passengers for it, or the transportation of such passengers is under the control of the United States. Bryant v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 480</cite>,

                        Transportation of Athletic Teams and School Bands. - While it is true that the statute which governs the operation of school buses makes no provision one way or the other for the transportation of athletic teams or school bands, it is equally true that
                        school bands and athletic teams are under the control of the school authorities. Therefore, the board controlling such activities would have the inherent right to contract for such transportation as might be necessary to transport
                        its athletic teams and its bands to and from events which have been scheduled under the supervision of school authorities, and such transportation would be exempt under subdivision (a)(1) of this section. State ex rel. N.C. Utils.

                            What constitutes "public convenience and necessity" is primarily an administrative question with a number of imponderables to be taken into consideration, e.g., whether there is a substantial public need for the service, whether the existing carriers
                            can reasonably meet this need, and whether it would endanger or impair the operations of existing carriers contrary to the public interest. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Queen City Coach Co.,

                            The Commission's conclusion that public convenience and necessity required the proposed service was unsupported by competent evidence in view of the entire record, where the petitioner failed to show that any individual required his service for a non-local,
                            intrastate move - witness testimony that he would recommend that his daughter use petitioner's services for a long-distance move did not constitute material evidence of a substantial public need absent statistics, expert testimony
                            or other evidence - and where petitioner failed to present evidence on the issues of whether existing carriers could reasonably meet the need for intrastate moving services and whether the granting of his application would
                            impair the operations of existing carriers contrary to the public interest; furthermore, contrary to the Commission's suggestion, the intervenors did not have the burden of showing that granting the application would have a
                            ruinous effect upon them. Dunnagan v. Ndikom, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 533 S.E.2d 494 (2000).

                            Applicant Failed to Show Public Convenience and Necessity. - The North Carolina Utilities Commission erred in granting petitioner's application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity under this section where the petitioner failed to show
                            that any individual required his service for a non-local, intrastate move and, although the petitioner's desire to serve the Hispanic community was commendable, he failed to show that the moving needs of the Hispanic community

                            and petitioner failed to present evidence on the issues of whether existing carriers could reasonably meet the need for intrastate moving services and whether granting his application would impair the operations of existing

                            Special Rule for Relocation of Existing Routes. - The Utilities Commission has developed a special rule for applications that seek only to relocate an existing route over a new highway. In these cases the Commission does not require such an extensive
                            demonstration of public convenience and necessity as in other cases. Instead, the applicant is only required to show that the proposed route, as it now exists and with future improvements, will provide a much safer, quicker
                            and improved service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 597, 199 S.E.2d 731 (1973), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 623</cite>,

                            By encouraging bus companies to make use of new and improved highways soon after they are opened, the special rule for relocation of existing routes serves "to promote, in the interest of the public, the inherent advantages of highway transportation,"
                            which is one of the stated purposes of the motor carriers statute. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Southern Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 597, 199 S.E.2d 731 (1973), cert. denied,

                            Test of "Public Need" Not Applicable to Transfer Proceedings. - The showing of public need which subsection (e)(1) of this section requires of an application for a new authority is not applicable in a transfer proceeding under G.S. 62-111 and was not
                            written into it by G.S. 62-111(a). State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Associated Petro. Carriers, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 173 S.E.2d 25 (1970).

                            Subsection (e) of G.S. 62-111 does not indicate a policy change toward protecting existing certificate holders from lawful competition. Like the subsection (a) "public convenience and necessity" test, the requirement that the Commission find the transfer
                            "in the public interest" does not write into the transfer approval procedure the new certificate test of public need in subsection (e)(1) of this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Associated Petro. Carriers,

                            Where Carrier's Authority Is Not Dormant. - The criteria "if justified by the public convenience and necessity" in subsection (a) of G.S. 62-111 is interpreted as a statutory basis for the test of dormancy. Where the authority has been abandoned or "dormant,"
                            the Commission has denied applications for transfer because approval would in effect be the granting of a new authority without satisfying the new authority test of public need set out in subsection (e)(1) of this section.
                            Where the authority has been actively operated, the applicants for sale and transfer of motor freight carrier rights are under no burden to show through shipper witnesses that a demand and need exist. The rationale is that
                            public convenience and necessity were shown to exist when the authority was granted or acquired, and the rebuttable presumption of law is that it continues. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Associated Petro. Carriers,

                        <p>
                            Where the issue of dormancy under G.S. 62-112(c) has been raised, if the Commission finds that the franchise is not dormant, it must then determine if the criteria required by G.S. 62-111 for approval of the transfer has been met. If the Commission finds
                            that the franchise is dormant under G.S. 62-112(c), the application for transfer must be denied, because approval would in effect constitute the granting of a new franchise without satisfying the new authority test and other
                            requirements of subsection (e) of this section. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Estes Express Lines, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 234 S.E.2d 624 (1977).

                            The factors denominated as imponderables, namely, whether the existing carriers can reasonably meet the need for the service, and whether the granting of the application would endanger or impair the operations of existing carriers contrary to the public
                            interest, are not solely determinative of the right of the Commission to grant the application. Both are directed to the question of public convenience and necessity. Nevertheless, if the proposed operation under the certificate
                            sought would seriously endanger or impair the operations of existing carriers contrary to the public interest, the certificate should not be issued. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Queen City Coach Co.,

                            Grant of Application Not Prohibited by Fact That Competing Carrier's Business Would Be Adversely Affected. - The fact that the granting of a proposed application would adversely affect the business of a carrier corporation is not a sufficiently compelling
                            reason to prohibit the entrance of other contract carriers into the field of transporting bank documents and other commodities. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v.

                            Applications to Serve Communities Served by Another Carrier and to Duplicate Routes Distinguished. - Application by carrier to serve communities being served by another carrier, who intervenes and protests the application, as distinguished from an application
                            for duplication of routes, does not require the Utilities Commission to find that the existing carrier's service is inadequate and to afford such existing carrier opportunity to remedy the inadequacy. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n

                            Protection as to Duplication in Route. - Granting of a franchise over any part of the route of an existing carrier is prohibited except upon prescribed conditions, and not merely a duplication of the same route from terminus to terminus, but the application
                            to serve communities being served by the intervening carrier need not be denied in toto because there would be a duplication of routes along a short distance, since the existing carrier may be protected as to the duplication
                            in route by proper restrictions in the certificate. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Queen City Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 119</cite>, 63 S.E.2d 113 (1951).

                            A traversing of the same highways for certain distances by competing carriers may readily become necessary in the public interest and, in such an instance, more than one certificate may be granted, subject to such restrictions as will protect the authorized
                            carrier in respect of that part of the highway to be traversed by both. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 43</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 249 (1963).

                            Former subsection (f) of this section did not forbid authority to two or more carriers to traverse the same segment of a highway so long as they did not render duplicate service. The mere fact that the two carriers would use the same highway for a distance
                            did not require a denial of the application. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 43</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 249 (1963).

                            it was shown to the satisfaction of the Commission that the existing operations were not providing sufficient service reasonably to meet the public convenience and necessity and the existing operators, after 30 days' notice,
                            failed to provide the service required by the Commission, it would be the duty of the Commission to do so. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 390</cite>,

                            This section does not purport to protect against all competition, but is designed to protect authorized carriers against ruinous competition, and does not prohibit service of the same points by different carriers over separate routes when such duplicate
                            service is in the public interest. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Queen City Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 119</cite>, 63 S.E.2d 113 (1951); State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Ray,

                            Commission May Grant "Closed Door" Authority Though Application Seeks Authority to Duplicate Service. - Since the Utilities Commission is not confined to the immediate scope of the pleadings filed, and may enlarge the scope of the inquiry, it may grant
                            a "closed door" authority even though the application is for authority to duplicate service. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 43</cite>, 132 S.E.2d

                            feasible a new and more direct route between the termini, the Utilities Commission, upon appropriate findings of fact, may grant such carrier "closed door" authority along the new route, notwithstanding that other carriers,

                            Treatment of Application for New Authority as Motion in Prior Cause. - An application for a new authority to carry passengers between two municipalities of the State along a new route made feasible by the improvement or construction of highways could
                            be treated by the Utilities Commission as a motion in a prior cause in which the Commission approved an agreement of the carriers in regard to their respective services between the cities provided the carriers affected were
                            given notice and an opportunity to be heard. The question of whether the prior order of approval could be collaterally attacked was thus obviated. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Coach Co.,

                    No certificate or broker's license shall be issued or remain in force until the applicant shall have procured and filed with the Division of Motor Vehicles such security bond, insurance or self-insurance for the protection of the public as the Commission
                    shall by regulation require. The Commission shall require that every motor carrier for which a certificate or license is required by the provisions of this Chapter, shall maintain liability insurance or satisfactory surety of at least
                    fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and, subject to said limit for one person, one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) because of bodily injury to or death of two
                    or more persons in any one accident, and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident; and the Commission may require any greater amount of insurance as may be necessary
                    for the protection of the public. Notwithstanding any rule or regulation to the contrary, the Commission shall not require that any insurance procured and filed be provided in any single policy of insurance or through a single insurer,
                    if the insurers involved are otherwise qualified. A motor carrier may satisfy the requirements of the Commission by procuring insurance with coverage and limits of liability required by the Commission in one or more policies of insurance
                    issued by one or more insurers.

                    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section or Chapter, bus companies shall file with the Commission proof of financial responsibility in the form of bonds, policies of insurance, or shall qualify as a self insurer, with minimum levels of financial
                    responsibility as prescribed for motor carriers of passengers pursuant to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. § 31138. Provided, further, that no bus company operating solely within the State of North Carolina and which is exempt from regulation

                    No common carriers of household goods by motor vehicle shall deliver or relinquish possession at destination of any freight transported by it in intrastate commerce until all tariff rates and charges thereon have been paid, except under such rules and
                    regulations as the Commission may from time to time prescribe to govern the settlement of all such rates and charges, including rules and regulations for weekly or monthly settlement, and to prevent unjust discrimination or undue preference
                    or prejudice; provided, that the provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit any such carrier from extending credit in connection with rates and charges on freight transported for the United States, for any department,
                    bureau, or agency thereof, or for the State, or political subdivision thereof. Where any common carrier by motor vehicle is instructed by a shipper or consignor to deliver household goods transported by such carrier to a consignee
                    other than the shipper or consignor, such consignee shall not be legally liable for transportation charges in respect of the transportation of such household goods (beyond those billed against him at the time of delivery for which
                    he is otherwise liable) which may be found to be due after the household goods have been delivered to him, if the consignee (i) is an agent only and had no beneficial title in the household goods, and (ii) prior to delivery of the
                    household goods has notified the delivering carrier in writing of the fact of such agency and absence of beneficial title, and, in the case of shipment reconsigned or diverted to a point other than that specified in the original bill
                    of lading, has also notified the delivering carrier in writing of the name and address of the beneficial owner of the household goods. In such cases the shipper and consignor, or, in the case of a shipment so reconsigned or diverted,
                    the beneficial owner shall be liable for such additional charges, irrespective of any provisions to the contrary in the bill of lading or in the contract under which the shipment was made. If the consignee has given to the carrier
                    erroneous information as to who is the beneficial owner, such consignee shall himself be liable for such additional charges, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section. On shipments reconsigned or diverted by an agent
                    who has furnished the carrier with a notice of agency and the proper name and address of the beneficial owner, and where such shipments are refused or abandoned at ultimate destination, the said beneficial owner shall be liable for
                    all legally applicable charges in connection therewith.

                    such sale vests in the purchaser all the right, title, interest and property of the parties to the action in which such judgment or decree was made, to said property and franchises, subject to all the conditions, limitations and restrictions
                    of the corporation; and the purchaser and his associates thereupon become a new corporation, by such name as they select, and they are the stockholders in the ratio of the purchase money by them contributed; and are entitled to all
                    the rights and franchises and subject to all the conditions, limitations and penalties of the corporation whose property and franchises have been so sold. In the event of the sale of a railroad in foreclosure of a mortgage or deed
                    of trust, whether under a decree of court or otherwise, the corporation created by or in consequence of the sale succeeds to all the franchises, rights and privileges of the original corporation only when the sale is of all the railroad
                    owned by the company and described in the mortgage or deed of trust, and when the railroad is sold as an entirety. If a purchaser at any such sale is a corporation, such purchasing corporation shall succeed to all the properties, franchises,
                    powers, rights, and privileges of the original corporation: Provided, that this shall not affect vested rights and shall not be construed to alter in any manner the public policy of the State now or hereafter established with reference
                    to trusts and contracts in restraint of trade.

                        Railroad May Be Sold. - A railroad is the subject of private property, and in that character is liable to be sold, unless the sale be forbidden by the legislature; not the franchise, but the land itself constituting the road. State v. Rives,
                        <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. 297</cite> (1844).

                        When Sale Effects Dissolution. - In order that the sale of the franchise and property of a railroad corporation under mortgage shall have the effect of a dissolution of such corporation, another corporation must be provided to take its place and assume
                        and discharge the obligations to the public growing out of the grant of the franchise; until that is done the old corporation continues to exist, and when it is done the new corporation will be a domestic corporation. James v.
                        Western N.C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 523</cite>, 28 S.E. 537 (1897).

                    <p>
                        Effect of Sale Under Second Mortgage. - The sale of a railroad under a second mortgage and a conveyance thereunder, subject to the first mortgage upon its franchise and corporate property, did not extinguish the corporate existence of the company nor
                        release it from liability to the public for the manner in which it was operated. James v. Western N.C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 523</cite>, 28 S.E. 537 (1897).

                    <p>
                        The effect of the sale of a railroad company's franchises and property under a second mortgage, subject to a first mortgage which was assumed by the purchaser, was to place the purchaser in the place of the mortgagor in its relation to the trustee of
                        the first mortgage, with the right to run and operate the road as agent of the mortgagor; however, the old corporation was not extinguished, but was still in existence and liable for damages caused by the maladministration of its
                        agent, which liability could be enforced against the property which it allowed the purchaser to use. James v. Western N.C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 523</cite>, 28 S.E. 537 (1897).

                        Purchaser Takes Rights of Old Company. - On the foreclosure of a mortgage given by a railroad company, the purchaser takes the rights that the company had acquired in relation to its right-of-way under its charter. Barker v. Southern R.R.,

                        as a public utility. Therefore, for the purpose of defraying the cost of regulating public utilities, every public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall pay a quarterly regulatory fee, in addition to all other
                        fees and taxes, as provided in this section. The fees collected shall be used only to pay the expenses of the Commission and the Public Staff in regulating public utilities in the interest of the public and to maintain a reasonable
                        margin for a reserve fund. The amount of the reserve may not exceed one-half of the cost of operating the Commission and the Public Staff as reflected in the certified budget for the previous fiscal year.

                        Construction of Penal Statute. - The rule that a penal statute must be strictly construed means no more than that the court, in ascertaining the meaning of such a statute, cannot go beyond the plain meaning of the words and phraseology employed in search
                        of an intention not certainly implied by them, and when there is reasonable doubt as to the meaning of the words used in the statute, the court will not give them such an interpretation as to impose the penalty, nor will the purpose

                        for the penalty simply because a citizen feeling himself aggrieved had made a complaint before it. It did have the right to investigate the matter for itself, but the end of such investigation was simply to afford it information
                        and enable it to act intelligently in determining whether it would sue for the penalty given by the statute. State ex rel. N.C. Corp. Comm'n v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 483</cite>, 61

                                commences and diligently pursues within the 60-day period such actions as are reasonably necessary to cause the facilities to be brought into compliance.

                    <p>
                        Statute Established Statutory Rights And Private Cause Of Action To Enforce Rights. - Public Utilities Act establishes several judicially-enforceable statutory rights and expressly created a private cause of action to enforce these rights; thus, communications
                        service providers satisfy the controversy requirement when they allege in their complaint and show at the trial that a real controversy, arising out of these statutory rights exists. Time Warner Entm't Advance/Newhouse P'ship v.
                        Town of Landis, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 747 S.E.2d 610 (2013).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Justiciable Controversy Existed. - Business court erred in dismissing a cable company's case against a town for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there existed a justiciable controversy; the controversy arose from the parties' failure to reach
                        an agreement regarding pole attachment rates within 90 days, and that failure violated the company's right to establish just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory pole attachment rates within 90 days of a request to negotiate under
                        the Public Utilities Act. Time Warner Entm't Advance/Newhouse P'ship v. Town of Landis, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 747 S.E.2d 610 (2013).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unreasonable Rates. - Utility's pole attachment rates charged to a communications service provider for a period at issue were properly found not just or reasonable because (1) it was not error to rely on the Federal Communications Commission cable rate
                        in making this determination, as no competent evidence of another rate was presented, (2) the cable rate was not presumptively adopted, as other factors were considered, and (3) such a result was not an absurd statutory interpretation.

                    <p>
                        Statutory Violation. - Utility was correctly found to have violated G.S. 62-350 by unilaterally raising the utility's pole attachment rates without negotiation because (1) the statute plainly barred the utility from subjecting a communications service
                        provider to a rate without first negotiating and subsequently adopting a rate or litigating disputes, and (2) the utility's organization as an electric membership corporation under N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 117 did not exempt the utility.
