                    prisoners from place to place in the State as their duties might require, and apprehending and arresting escaped prisoners and returning them to prison. The governing authorities of the State prison system are authorized to determine

                    The willful failure of a prisoner to remain within the extended limits of his confinement, or to return within the time prescribed to the place of confinement designated by the Secretary of Public Safety, shall be deemed an escape from the custody of
                    the Secretary of Public Safety punishable as provided in G.S. 148-45.

       Pilot Program - Conducting Court Proceedings Using Videoconferencing Technology for Persons in Custody.
      </b> - Session Laws 2009-270, ss. 1-4, provide: "SECTION 1. The Administrative Office of the Courts, in consultation with the Department of Correction [Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public
                    Safety], shall conduct a pilot program to test the feasibility of using videoconference or similar technology to conduct court proceedings involving defendants in the custody of the Department of Correction, instead of requiring live
                    appearances in court for those defendants. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall designate two counties to participate in the pilot, and the Department of Correction shall designate one prison facility. The Administrative Office
                    of the Courts may also designate one or more counties to participate in a pilot program involving persons in the custody of local confinement facilities to test the feasibility of using videoconferencing equipment to conduct proceedings
                    authorized by this act but not otherwise authorized by law.

                    "SECTION 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the courts participating in the pilot program authorized by this act may conduct proceedings required under G.S. 15A-511, Article 26 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 15A</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes, G.S. 15A-601, and G.S. 15A-941 by videoconference without the consent of the defendant. If a defendant voluntarily and knowingly waives his or her right to appear in person, the court may also accept guilty
                    pleas and impose sentences in cases in which the plea is taken by videoconference, conduct hearings on motions, and conduct probation modification or revocation proceedings. The waiver may be taken by videoconference. In the jurisdictions
                    participating in the pilot programs, no proceeding in which a person is charged with a capital felony may be conducted using videoconferencing equipment, but nothing in this act shall be construed to limit the use of testimony at a
                    trial taken by videoconferencing equipment when the testimony is otherwise allowed by law to be taken in that manner.

                    "SECTION 3. The equipment used in conducting the videoconference proceedings authorized by this act shall be used in a manner that ensures that the judicial official conducting the proceeding and the defendant can see and hear each other and that ensures
                    that the defendant and his or her attorney may communicate during the proceeding in a manner that preserves the defendant's right to confidential communication with counsel.

                    to the Chief Justice, the Secretary of Correction, [Secretary of Public Safety]the Chairs of the Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittees on Justice and Public Safety, and the Chairs of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees.
                    The study shall address the costs of implementing videoconferencing on a statewide basis for these purposes, as well as the cost savings obtained through the use of such equipment, the quality of the transmissions, the frequency of
                    use, and any other relevant information the Commission deems appropriate. The report shall be submitted no later than May 1, 2010. The Administrative Office of the Courts and the Department of Correction may seek grant funds to offset
                    any costs associated with the study that cannot be provided by appropriations to those agencies."

                        Power to Designate Places of Confinement. - This section gives the Director of Prisons (now the Secretary of Correction) or his duly authorized agents or representatives the authority to designate the places of confinement within the State prison system
                        where the sentences of prisoners shall be served. State v. Whitley, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 742</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 600 (1965).

        Recommendation as to Confinement Held Not to Constitute Cruel and Unusual Punishment.
       </b> - An attachment to commitment papers recommending "that the defendant not be placed upon work release or permitted to leave his place of confinement under this section or any other statute but be kept at all times in
                        close security until the sentence is completed" was a mere recommendation and had no legal effect upon the type or place of incarceration of the petitioner, and it did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Harris v. North
                        Carolina, 320 F. Supp. 770 (M.D.N.C. 1970), aff'd, 435 F.2d 1305 (4th Cir. 1971).

                        Good Time, Gain Time, and Merit Time Credits. - North Carolina Department of Corrections' interpretation that petitioner's good time, gain time, and merit time credits were not awarded to him for purposes of unconditional release was statutorily and constitutionally
                        permissible where petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to life pursuant to G.S. 14-2. Jones v. Keller, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 249</cite>, 698 S.E.2d 49 (2010).

                        Instruction on Willfulness Under This Section Unnecessary in Prosecution Under G.S. 148-45. - In a prosecution for felonious escape under G.S. 148-45, trial court was not required to instruct the jury pursuant to this section that one of the essential
                        elements of felonious escape is that the failure to remain in or return to confinement must be willful, since defendant was not charged with escape while outside the place of his confinement pursuant to authorization by the Secretary
                        of Correction under this section, but was charged under G.S. 148-45, which establishes the general escape offense, and that section does not contain the word "willful." State v. Rose, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite>                        608, 281 S.E.2d 404 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Court's Sentencing Orders to be Followed by Department of Corrections. - Since the superior court was authorized by G.S. 15A-1417 to enter an appropriate sentence upon granting defendant's motion for appropriate relief, and since G.S. 148-4 provided that
                        any sentencing order bound defendant to commitment with the North Carolina Department of Corrections under the terms of that appropriate sentence, the superior court's authority to order the Department to change its records to
                        reflect entry of the appropriate sentence was unaffected by defendant's decision to file a motion for appropriate relief rather than a civil suit naming the Department as a party defendant; the Department could not refuse the superior
                        court's order to change defendant's records to reflect concurrent instead of consecutive sentences simply because the sentencing order was entered following defendant's motion for appropriate relief. State v. Ellis,
                        <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 276, 605 S.E.2d 168 (2004), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 200</cite>, 639 S.E.2d 425 (2007) (remanded to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea).

                        Evidence Held Sufficient to Support Finding of Escape. - Testimony of a sergeant with the North Carolina Department of Correction assigned to the prison camp in which defendant was confined that on the day in question defendant was given permission to
                        leave the unit on a Community Volunteer Leave was sufficient to support the jury's finding, and it was not necessary that the State present evidence to show that the Secretary of Correction, after making a determination that there
                        was reasonable cause to believe that defendant would honor his trust, had personally authorized defendant's release to participate in the community volunteer program and had personally prescribed the precise period of time during
                        which the defendant was permitted to be absent from the prison unit. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 15, 217 S.E.2d 729, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 512</cite>,

                        the State's obligations under law, he shall direct the Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission to release on parole over a reasonable period of time a number of prisoners sufficient to that purpose. From the time the Secretary
                        directs the Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission until the prison population has been reduced to a more manageable level, the Secretary may not accept any inmates ordered transferred from local confinement facilities

                        the inmate was transferred. In order to meet the requirements of this section, the Parole Commission shall not parole any person convicted under Article 7B of Chapter 14 of a sex offense, under G.S. 14-39, 14-41, or 14-43.3, under

                    of Correction [Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety] shall consult with the county or municipality in which the unit is located or any private for-profit or nonprofit firm about the possibility
                    of converting that unit to other use. The Department may provide for the lease of any of these units to counties, municipalities, or private firms wishing to convert them to other use and the Department may also consider converting

                        Credits. - Lower courts erred in ruling that defendant's credits should be applied to his sentence, including an unconditional release date, because defendant - whose death sentence had been vacated and replaced with a life sentence - was lawfully incarcerated,
                        the nature and severity of his offenses remained the same and the Department of Correction had discretion in governing him and had never applied credits towards the calculation of an unconditional release date for similar inmates.

                        Fact that disciplinary punishment inflicted on a prisoner by a prison official was administered in accordance with the rules and regulations of the former State Highway and Public Works Commission did not render the prison official immune to prosecution
                        for assault unless the particular regulation relied on was within the statutory authority of the Commission. State v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 229</cite>, 56 S.E.2d 713 (1949).

                        Honor-Grade Status, Work-Release Privilege and Parole Are Discretionary Acts of Clemency. - Honor-grade status, work-release privilege, and parole are discretionary acts of grace or clemency extended by the State as a reward for good behavior, conferring
                        no vested rights upon the convicted person. An accused person must be given full constitutional protection before and during his trial, but procedures of constitutional dimension are not appropriate in subsequent determinations
                        of rewards for good behavior while serving a validly imposed sentence of confinement. Goble v. Bounds, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 186 S.E.2d 638, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 307</cite>,

                        In Mitigation of Terms of Judgment. - The grant of honor-grade status, work release, and parole is by way of mitigating the terms of the judgment which the court has entered. The legality and propriety of the trial and sentence have already been determined
                        after the prisoner has been heard and his constitutional rights have been accorded him. The merits of the trial and the validity of the judgment may not again be raised before the Department of Correction and the Board of Paroles
                        (now Parole Commission). Goble v. Bounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 307</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 347 (1972).

                        Involving Policy Decisions. - Whether a prisoner is entitled to honor-grade status, work release, or parole involves policy decisions which should be decided by the Department of Correction and the Board of Paroles (Parole Commission). These agencies
                        are charged with the duty of making such decisions and are properly given means of discharging it not available to the courts. Goble v. Bounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 307</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 347 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Mitigation of Sentence Not the Right of the Prisoner. - While a prisoner takes with him into the prison certain rights which may not be denied him, the legal right to the mitigation of his punishment is not one of them. It is contemplated as a part of
                        his rehabilitation that he earn his right to honor-grade status, work release, or parole. The decision is not in the nature of an adversary proceeding under rules of evidence. Goble v. Bounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 307</cite>,

                        Inmate Being Considered for Honor-Grade Status or Work Release Is Not Entitled to Procedural Due Process. - An inmate being considered for honor-grade status or work release is not entitled, either under the State or federal Constitutions, to procedural
                        due process rights. Goble v. Bounds, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 186 S.E.2d 638, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 307</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 347 (1972).

                        Judges still have discretion to increase or reduce sentences from the presumptive term upon findings of aggravating or mitigating factors, the weighing of which is a matter within their sound discretion. The balance struck by the trial judge will not
                        be disturbed if there is support in the record for his determination. State v. Stone, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 417, 322 S.E.2d 413 (1984).

                        Trial judge's remarks concerning the effect of "good time" and "gain time", which were not an expression of dissatisfaction with the length of time convicted criminals must serve in prison, but were made in an effort to respond to defense counsel's impassioned
                        argument concerning the fact that the defendant would be required to serve other sentences totalling four years at the expiration of the sentence at issue, could not be said to indicate that the trial court was using the sentencing
                        process to thwart the Fair Sentencing Act. State v. Swimm, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 24</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 65 (1985).

                        Life Sentences. - Trial court erred in finding that two inmates were eligible to reduce their Class C life sentences by gain and meritorious time credits for the purpose of determining their parole eligibility dates, as (1) sentence reduction credit regulations
                        promulgated under former G.S. 148-13(c) and (d) did not apply to Class C life sentences, and (2) the Secretary of Correction had not passed regulations under former G.S. 148-13(b) to apply good, gain, and meritorious time credits
                        to life sentences. Teasley v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 282, 574 S.E.2d 137 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 169</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 755 (2003).

                        Lower courts erred in ruling that defendant's credits should be applied to his sentence, including an unconditional release date, because defendant - whose death sentence had been vacated and replaced with a life sentence - was lawfully incarcerated,
                        the nature and severity of his offenses remained the same and the Department of Correction had discretion in governing him and had never applied credits towards the calculation of an unconditional release date for similar inmates.

                    the results of the study referenced in subsection (a) of this section. The goal of the pilot program is to assess whether the use of telemedicine decreases costs for inmate transportation, custody, and outside providers while improving

                    telemedicine; and Finding 6, Report Number 2018-08, from the Joint Legislative Program Evaluation Oversight Committee. The telemedicine pilot program shall initially be established in two correctional facilities serving male inmates.
                    One pilot site shall be located in a correctional facility in the eastern portion of the State and one pilot site shall be located in a correctional facility in the western portion of the State. The pilot program design must connect
                    the two correctional facility pilot sites with the Central Prison Healthcare Complex and its contracted providers' facilities and shall be operational on or before January 1, 2020.

                    <p>
                        Prison Health Clinician Was Agent of Sheriff. - Because a sheriff had a nondelegable duty to provide medical care to inmates, defendant, who was employed by prison health services as a mental health clinician, was an agent of the sheriff as a matter of
                        law; in a prosecution for sexual activity by a custodian, the trial court did not err in barring in limine the introduction of a contract, which according to defendant showed that he was an independent contractor and not an agent
                        or employee of the sheriff's office, because as a matter of law defendant was acting as an agent of the sheriff when the crimes were allegedly committed. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite>                        100, 643 S.E.2d 620 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 162</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 359 (2008).

                        The Department of Correction has a duty to provide adequate medical care to inmates in its custody, and the duty is of such great importance that the State cannot avoid liability by contracting with someone else to perform it. Medley v. North Carolina
                        Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 837</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 654 (1992).

                        Decision to Employ Physicians Policy Decision. - In an inmate's action alleging medical malpractice against physicians employed by the Department of Public Safety (DPS), the trial court did not err in denying the physicians' motions to dismiss on the
                        ground of public official immunity because the physicians were not public officials entitled to immunity; DPS's decision to employ its own physicians appears to be a policy decision. Leonard v. Bell,

        Legislative Intent.
       </b> - Although Substance Abuse Advisory Council was not given any rule making authority of its own, the clear intent of the General Assembly was to give Council an active role in the formulation of policy governing the
                        substance abuse program. Thus, Council was directed to give advice to Secretary of Correction as to any rules and regulations and on any other matters pertaining to program; however, 1987 legislation did not impose a duty upon
                        the Commission for Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services to consult directly with Council; the Commission's responsibility as set out in subsection (d) of this section was left untouched and is fulfilled
                        by giving Secretary of Correction opportunity to review and comment on proposed standards for delivery of substance abuse services to inmates. Secretary of Correction should then consult with the Council under G.S. 143B-270 and
                        143B-271 in order to effectuate the legislatively intended role of the Council. See opinion of Attorney General to Substance Abuse Council, 60 N.C.A.G. 27 (1990).

                    shall receive custody of the prisoner in accordance with the terms of the order. Prior to the conclusion of the 30-day period, the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice shall conduct an assessment of treatment and venue
                    needs. The assessment shall be conducted by the attending medical or mental health professional and shall assess the medical and mental health needs of the prisoner and make a recommendation on whether the prisoner should remain in
                    the custody of the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety or if the prisoner should be returned to the custody of the county. To extend the order beyond the initial 30-day period, the sheriff

                    judge who shall determine whether to extend the transfer of the prisoner to a unit of the State prison system beyond the initial 30-day period. If the judge determines that the prisoner should remain in the custody of the Division
                    of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice, the judge shall renew the order and include a date certain for review by the court. Prior to the date of review, the Division shall conduct a reassessment of treatment and venue needs and the
                    sheriff shall provide the reassessment and any other relevant information to the court, as described in this subsection. If the judge determines that the prisoner should not remain in the custody of the Division of Adult Correction

                    of the misdemeanant.

                        As a rehabilitative measure, the Secretary of Public Safety is authorized to require any prisoner granted work-release privileges to make restitution or reparation to an aggrieved party from any earnings gained by the defendant while on work release when
                        the sentencing court recommends that restitution or reparation be paid by the defendant out of any earnings gained by the defendant if he is granted work-release privileges and out of other resources of the defendant, including
                        all real and personal property owned by the defendant and the income derived from such property. The Secretary shall not be bound by such recommendation, but if they elect not to implement the recommendation, they shall state in
                        writing the reasons therefor, and shall forward the same to the sentencing court.

                        When an active sentence is imposed, the court shall consider whether, as a rehabilitative measure, it should recommend to the Secretary of Public Safety that restitution or reparation be made by the defendant out of any earnings gained by the defendant
                        if he is granted work-release privileges and out of other resources of the defendant, including all real and personal property owned by the defendant, and income derived from such property. If the court determines that restitution
                        or reparation should not be recommended, it shall so indicate on the commitment. If, however, the court determines that restitution or reparation should be recommended, the court shall make its recommendation a part of the order
                        committing the defendant to custody. The recommendation shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of G.S. 15A-1343(d) and Article 81C of Chapter 15A of the General Statutes. If the offense is one in which there is evidence
                        of physical, mental or sexual abuse of a minor, the court may order the defendant to pay from work release earnings the cost of rehabilitative treatment for the minor. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall prepare and distribute
                        forms which provide ample space to make restitution or reparation recommendations incident to commitments, which forms shall be conveniently structured to enable the sentencing court to make its recommendation.

                    <p>
                        Constitutionality. - Since the decision to impose restitution or reparation is discretionary with the trial court and the Secretary, and since indigency could be considered in making that decision, subsection (c) of this section and G.S. 148-57.1(c) are
                        not unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection discriminating against indigent defendants. State v. Lambert, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 418, 252 S.E.2d 855 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The requirement that a defendant pay restitution under subsection (c) of this section or G.S. 148-57.1(c) as a condition of obtaining work-release or parole is not inherently unconstitutional. Whether the restitution requirement is unconstitutional as
                        applied to a particular defendant may only be determined by considering the defendant's financial status and other relevant circumstances at the time when the restitution must be paid, that is, after a defendant becomes eligible
                        for work-release privileges or parole. State v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 55</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 410 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Restitution is intended to be compensatory, not punitive. State v. Easter, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 398 S.E.2d 619 (1990).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The purpose of this section and G.S. 15A-1343(b)(6) is rehabilitation and not additional penalty or punishment, and the sum ordered or recommended must be reasonably related to the damages incurred. If the trial evidence does not support the amount ordered
                        or recommended, then supporting evidence should be required in the sentencing hearing. State v. Killian, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 245 S.E.2d 812 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Court's Order or Recommendation for Restitution or Restoration Must Be Supported by Evidence. - Together subsection (c) of this section and G.S. 15A-1343(b)(6) require that any order or recommendation of the sentencing court for restitution or restoration
                        to the aggrieved party as a condition of attaining work-release privileges must be supported by the evidence. State v. Killian, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 245 S.E.2d 812 (1978); State
                        v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 720</cite>, 459 S.E.2d 192 (1995).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An order of restitution as a condition of work-release must be supported by evidence adduced at trial or at sentencing. State v. Daye, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 753, 338 S.E.2d 557, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 502</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Amount of Restitution Must Be Supported by Evidence. - Regardless of whether restitution is ordered or recommended by the trial court, the amount must be supported by the evidence. State v. Daye, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite>                        753, 338 S.E.2d 557, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 502</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 576 (1986).

                    <p>
                        There must be something more than a guess or conjecture as to an appropriate amount of restitution, as restitution is not intended to punish defendants, but to compensate victims. State v. Daye, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite>                        753, 338 S.E.2d 557, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 502</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 576 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Court Not Required to Consider Ability to Pay. - Trial court did not err in failing to consider defendant's ability to pay restitution, as the potentially binding determination at a later date requiring defendant to pay restitution as a condition of work
                        release or parole by either the Department of Correction or the Parole Commission would by necessity require sufficient evidence of defendant's ability to pay at that time. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 720</cite>,
                        459 S.E.2d 192 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Duty of Sentencing Court to Consider Restitution or Restoration as Prerequisite to Work-Release. - The sentencing court is not only authorized but is required by subsection (c) of this section, when an active sentence is imposed, to consider whether,
                        as a further rehabilitative measure, restitution or restoration should be ordered or recommended to the Secretary of Correction to be imposed as a condition of attaining work-release privileges. State v. Killian,
                        <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 245 S.E.2d 812 (1978).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the decision to recommend restitution or reparation is discretionary, and the trial court is not required to impose such a condition. State v. Lambert, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 418, 252 S.E.2d 855 (1979).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A recommendation of restitution as a condition of work-release is not binding on the Parole Commission or Department of Corrections. State v. Daye, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 753, 338 S.E.2d 557, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 502</cite>,
                        349 S.E.2d 576 (1986).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Restitution or reparation may only be recommended as a condition of work-release, and the trial court is without authority to "order" restitution as a condition of work release. State v. Easter, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite>                        36, 398 S.E.2d 619 (1990).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Restitution Cannot Be Imposed with Active Prison Sentence. - When a court imposes an active sentence, it may recommend restitution as a condition of work-release, as a condition of post-release supervision and parole, or as a condition of probation, but
                        it may not require the defendant to make restitution while serving an active sentence. State v. Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 524 S.E.2d 63 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imposition of Fine Is Not Restitution. - When an active sentence is imposed, the judge should consider whether, as a further rehabilitative measure, restitution or reparation should be ordered or recommended to the Secretary of Correction to be imposed
                        as a condition of attaining work-release privileges; however, the imposition of a fine is not restitution or reparation within the meaning of this section and should not be included in a judgment under this section. State v. Alexander,
                        <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 267 S.E.2d 396 (1980).

                            Belief in Innocence or Legal Errors in Convictions. - It would bring the law into disrepute and completely render prison order and discipline unenforceable if prisoners convicted of crime could exercise the right of self-judgment and self-help and be
                            allowed to escape from imprisonment, either because they believed themselves to be innocent or believed that their convictions were obtained through legal error. State v. Goff, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 563</cite>,
                            142 S.E.2d 142 (1965).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Innocence or Guilt of Original Offense Is Immaterial to Crime of Escape. - It is generally held by the more modern authorities that it is immaterial whether a prisoner is innocent or guilty of the original offense insofar as his liability for escaping
                            is concerned. State v. Goff, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 563</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 142 (1965).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a prisoner is held in legal custody and commits an escape, the crime itself does not depend upon whether he would have been adjudged guilty or innocent of the original offense had the proper procedure for appeal been followed. State v. Goff,
                            <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 563</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 142 (1965).

                        <p>
                            As Is Later Determination That Original Conviction Was Void. - The crime of escape does not depend upon whether it may or may not be determined in a future habeas corpus proceeding that his original conviction was void for defects in the judgment of conviction
                            by a court of competent jurisdiction. State v. Goff, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 563</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 142 (1965).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Or Voidable. - Deprivation of procedural rights before or during imprisonment does not constitute grounds or justification for, an escape by a prisoner serving a sentence imposed by authority of law. This is so even though the sentence the prisoner was
                            serving at the time was later held to be irregular or voidable. A prisoner in such case may not put himself in defiance of the duly constituted authorities by escaping from custody but must seek redress in compliance with due
                            process. State v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 166 S.E.2d 858 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            North Carolina has held that a prisoner escaping while serving a sentence is not immune to punishment for the escape even though the sentence he was serving at the time of the escape was irregular or voidable and is set aside and a new trial ordered after
                            the escape but prior to imposition of sentence for the escape, since a prisoner serving a sentence imposed by authority of law may not defy that authority but must seek redress in compliance with due process. Kelly v. North

                            The elements of felonious escape are (1) lawful custody, (2) while serving a sentence imposed upon a plea of guilty, a plea of nolo contendere, or a conviction for a felony, and (3) escape from such custody. State v. Malone,
                            <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 326 S.E.2d 302 (1985).

                            Exact time is not an essential element of the offense of escape as set out in subdivision (g)(1) of this section and the 24-hour exception provided in subdivision (g)(2) of this section is a defense which a defendant may raise should the evidence warrant
                            such a defense. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss at the close of the State's evidence on the grounds that the warrant did not set out the exact date and time of the alleged escape
                            and further failed to state that the period of time was in excess of the 24-hour time limitation found in subdivision (g)(2) of this section. State v.

                            Indictment to Allege Conviction of a Misdemeanor or Felony. - It is necessary to allege that the escape or attempted escape occurred when defendant was serving a sentence imposed upon conviction of a misdemeanor or of a felony, irrespective of whether
                            the presently alleged escape or attempted escape was alleged to be a first or a second offense. State v. Jordan, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 253</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 497 (1957); State v. Whitley,

                        <p>
                            Need Not State the Specific Felony. - An indictment charging that defendant escaped from lawful custody while serving a sentence for a felony imposed in the superior court of a named county was sufficient, without naming the felony for which defendant
                            was imprisoned, and reference in the indictment to the felony was surplusage. State v. Stallings, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 405</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 252 (1966).

                            An indictment charging that a defendant escaped while serving a sentence for a felony imposed in the superior court in a named county is sufficient without naming the felony.

                        <p>
                            Absence of Other Detailed Information. - Where defendant contended that warrant was defective in that it did not allege: (1) the year of defendant's conviction in Craven County; (2) the length of the sentence imposed; (3) the number of the defendant's
                            commitment from Craven County; and (4) the trial docket number of the case in which the commitment was issued, it was held that such detailed information was not required to charge an offense under this section. State v. Harper,
                            <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 354</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 475 (1965).

                            Indictment Held Insufficient to Charge Felony Escape. - A bill of indictment was insufficient to charge the felony of escape while serving a felony sentence, notwithstanding the indictment used the word "felony" to describe one of the offenses for which
                            defendant was serving sentence when he escaped, where it also alleged that sentences for both offenses were imposed in district courts, since district courts are without jurisdiction to impose sentence in felony cases; however,
                            the indictment was sufficient to charge misdemeanor escape. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 75, 187 S.E.2d 470 (1972).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Variance Held Not Fatal. - Where bill of indictment charged that defendant escaped while lawfully confined in the North Carolina State prison system in the lawful custody of the North Carolina Department of Correction, and the evidence showed he escaped
                            while assigned by an official of the Department of Correction to work under an employee of the State Highway Commission (now Board of Transportation), the variance was not fatal. State v. Coleman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 211 S.E.2d 542 (1975).

                        <p>
                            Because defendant's indictment for felonious escape tracked the statutory language of G.S. 148-45(g), defendant was effectively charged with a work-release escape, regardless of whether the indictment's citation to G.S. 148-45(b) was erroneous, due to
                            the fact that defendant was sufficiently apprised of the charge at issue. State v. Lockhart, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 316, 639 S.E.2d 5, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 365</cite>,

                            Further Prosecution Not Barred by Arrest of Judgment for Defective Indictment. - Arrest of judgment on the ground that the bill of indictment is fatally defective does not bar further prosecution for a violation of this section if the solicitor deems
                            it advisable to proceed on a new bill. State v. Whitley, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 742</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 600 (1965).

                        <p>
                            Nor by Mistrial on Such Ground. - Where indictment on its face negatived any possibility of a showing that at the time of the alleged escape the defendant was serving a sentence in prison, such indictment was fatally defective, and the action of the court
                            in ordering a mistrial was tantamount to quashing the bill of indictment, which the trial court had the right to do ex mero motu; hence, the defendant's conviction on a second bill of indictment was valid and a plea of former
                            jeopardy was properly overruled. State v. Whitley, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 742</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 600 (1965).

                            To prove felonious escape under G.S. 148-45(b)(2), the State needed to prove that defendant was charged with a felony and had been committed to the custody of the Department of Correction; testimony concerning the kind of crimes for which defendant was
                            sentenced to prison was relevant and competent evidence, and defendant's conviction was affirmed. State v. McDonald, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 458, 593 S.E.2d 793, cert. denied,

                            Proof of Lawfulness of Custody and Type of Offense for Which Defendant Committed Prerequisite to Conviction. - In order to sustain a conviction for the offense of escape under this section, the State must prove, among other things, from the evidence and
                            beyond a reasonable doubt, that at the time of the escape defendant was in the lawful custody of the State Department of Correction and was serving a sentence imposed upon a plea of guilty, a plea of nolo contendere, or a conviction
                            for a felony. State v. Ledford, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 175 S.E.2d 605 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a defendant is charged with escape from the State prison system under this section the State is entitled to introduce evidence of any and all convictions for which defendant was in custody at the time of escape. State v. Hammond,
                            <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 662</cite>, 300 S.E.2d 361 (1983).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before a defendant can be convicted of felonious escape, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of his escape defendant was serving a sentence of incarceration imposed for the conviction of a felony. State v. Hammond,
                            <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 662</cite>, 300 S.E.2d 361 (1983).

                            When a defendant is charged with escape under this statute, the State has the burden of proving that defendant was in the legal custody of the Department of Correction at the time of the escape. Testimony concerning the kind of crimes for which defendant
                            was sentenced to prison is relevant and competent evidence which the State may introduce in order to meet its burden of proof on this issue. State v. Hammond, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 662</cite>,
                            300 S.E.2d 361 (1983).

                        <p>
                            When a defendant is charged with felonious escape from the state prison system under this section, the State has the burden of proving that defendant was in the legal custody of the Department of Correction at the time of the escape, serving a sentence
                            imposed upon conviction of a felony. Accordingly, the State is entitled to introduce evidence of any and all convictions for which defendant was in custody at the time of escape. State v. Parrish,
                            <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 327 S.E.2d 613 (1985).

                        <p>
                            To sustain a conviction for escape the State must prove that the defendant was in lawful custody and was serving a sentence imposed upon a plea of guilty, a plea of nolo contendere, or a conviction for a felony. State v. Malone,
                            <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 326 S.E.2d 302 (1985).

                        <p>
                            The legislature, in setting the presumptive sentence for escape, presumably took into account that evidence of an underlying plea or conviction would be necessary to prove the offense. State v. Malone, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite>                            323, 326 S.E.2d 302 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Failure to Prove Defendant Serving Sentence. - Defendant was improperly convicted of felonious escape where the State failed to present any evidence that defendant was serving a sentence for the commission of a felony on the date defendant escaped from
                            a county jail. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite> 494, 553 S.E.2d 410 (2001).

                        <p>
                            Voluntary Return Not Proven. - Motion to dismiss was properly denied in defendant's trial for work-release escape under G.S. 148-45(g)(1) because, although the evidence demonstrated that defendant was recaptured within 24 hours, it also indicated that
                            defendant's family only surrendered him after officers threatened to obtain a search warrant and press criminal charges against the family members for harboring a fugitive; thus, defendant failed to show that the undisputed
                            evidence supported the conclusion that he voluntarily returned into custody. State v. Lockhart, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 316, 639 S.E.2d 5, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 365</cite>,

                            What Evidence Competent to Show Lawfulness of Custody and Type of Offense. - Certified copies of the record of the superior court showing defendant's conviction and sentence, or a commitment issued under the hand and official seal of the clerk of the
                            superior court, are admissible for the purpose of showing that defendant was in lawful custody at the time of the alleged escape. State v. Stallings, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 405</cite>, 148
                            S.E.2d 252 (1966).

                        <p>
                            A properly certified copy of the commitment is competent, when introduced into evidence, to show the lawfulness of the custody and the type of offense for which defendant was committed. State v. Ledford, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite>                            245, 175 S.E.2d 605 (1970).

                            The defense of duress or escaping against his will will not be available to a prisoner charged with escape except where such defendant meets all of the following five requirements: (1) The prisoner is faced with a specific threat of death, forcible sexual
                            attack or substantial bodily injury in the immediate future; (2) there is no time for a complaint to the authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints which make any result from such complaints illusory; (3) there
                            is no time or opportunity to resort to courts; (4) there is no evidence of force or violence used towards prison personnel or other "innocent" persons in the escape; and (5) the prisoner immediately reports to the proper authorities
                            when he has attained a position of safety from the immediate threat. State v. Watts, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 191, 298 S.E.2d 436 (1982).

                            Nature of Offense for Which Defendant Committed as Question for Jury. - A defendant who has committed an escape is entitled to have his case submitted to the jury on the question of whether he was imprisoned while serving a sentence imposed for a felony
                            or for a misdemeanor. State v. Ledford, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 175 S.E.2d 605 (1970).

                            Prejudicial Error Not to Charge Jury That It Must Find Defendant Was Serving Sentence for Felony Conviction at Time of Escape. - Since defendant's plea of not guilty put in issue every essential element of the crime charged, and defendant was charged
                            with escaping from the lawful custody of the State Department of Correction while then and there serving time for a felony, trial judge's failure to instruct the jury that before they could convict defendant of the felony of
                            escape charged, they must find beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of the escape he was serving a sentence imposed upon conviction of a felony, was prejudicial error which entitled defendant to a new trial. State v.
                            McCloud, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 181 S.E.2d 204 (1971).

                        <p>
                            The court erred where it did not require the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was serving a felony sentence in a prosecution under this section. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite>                            85, 203 S.E.2d 424 (1974).

                        <p>
                            Instruction on Willfulness Unnecessary. - In a prosecution for felonious escape under this section, the trial court was not required to instruct the jury pursuant to G.S. 148-4 that one of the essential elements of felonious escape is that the failure
                            to remain in or return to confinement must be willful, since defendant was not charged with escape while outside the place of his confinement pursuant to authorization by the Secretary of Correction under G.S. 148-4, but was
                            charged under this section, which establishes the general escape offense and does not contain the word willful. State v. Rose, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 608, 281 S.E.2d 404 (1981).

                            Erroneous Reference to Another Section in Judgment and Commitment Order Held Not Prejudicial. - The fact that the judgment and commitment order in an escape prosecution erroneously referred to G.S. 148-48 instead of this section was not prejudicial to
                            the defendant. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 51, 175 S.E.2d 381 (1970).

        Constitutional Liability.
       </b> - While simple reasonableness governs official forcible encounters with "free citizens," a vastly different standard governs use of force against convicted prisoners. The prohibition in U.S. Const., Amend. VIII against
                        cruel and unusual punishment requires liability for the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. Morrison v. Martin, 755 F. Supp. 683 (E.D.N.C. 1990), aff'd, 917 F.2d 1302 (4th Cir. 1990).

        This section specifically permits the use of force to enforce lawful orders by prison officials.
       </b> The deference due to prison administrators in the establishment of policies reasonably related to legitimate governmental objectives is well established. Morrison v. Martin, 755 F. Supp. 683 (E.D.N.C. 1990), aff'd,

        The use of force against prisoners may be appropriate, depending upon the existence of certain factors:
       </b> (1) The need for force; (2) the amount of force needed in relation to the amount used; (3) the extent of injury inflicted; and (4) whether the force arose out of good faith efforts to maintain discipline as opposed
                        to the malicious infliction of harm. Stokes v. Galyan, 618 F. Supp. 1483 (W.D.N.C. 1985).

                        Honor-Grade Status, Work-Release Privilege and Parole as Discretionary Acts of Clemency. - Honor-grade status, work-release privilege, and parole are discretionary acts of grace or clemency extended by the State as a reward for good behavior, conferring
                        no vested rights upon the convicted person. An accused person must be given full constitutional protection before and during his trial, but procedures of constitutional dimension are not appropriate in subsequent determinations

                        or post-release supervision granted the defendant. If the court determines that restitution or reparation should not be recommended, it shall so indicate on the commitment. If, however, the court determines that restitution or
                        reparation should be recommended, the court shall make its recommendation a part of the order committing the defendant to custody. The recommendation shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article 81C of Chapter

                        Constitutionality. - Since the decision to impose restitution or reparation is discretionary with the trial court, the Secretary and the Parole Commission, and since indigency could be considered in making that decision, G.S. 148-33.2(c) and subsection
                        (c) of this section are not unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection discriminating against indigent defendants. State v. Lambert, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 418, 252 S.E.2d 855 (1979).

                        The requirement that a defendant pay restitution under G.S. 148-33.2(c) or subsection (c) of this section as a condition of obtaining work-release or parole is not inherently unconstitutional. Whether the restitution requirement is unconstitutional as
                        applied to a particular defendant may only be determined by considering the defendant's financial status and other relevant circumstances at the time when the restitution must be paid, that is, at the time he becomes eligible for
                        parole or work-release privileges. State v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 55</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 410 (1981), overruled on other grounds, State v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 432</cite>,

        Constitutionality of Requiring Repayment of Attorneys' Fees.
       </b> - The interlocking statutes and court decisions that regulate North Carolina's ability to recover the costs of court-appointed counsel meet constitutional requirements. The indigent defendant's fundamental right to
                        counsel is preserved under the system; he is given ample opportunity to challenge the decision to require repayment at all critical stages; and he is protected against heightened civil or criminal penalties based solely on his
                        inability to pay. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though far from a paragon of clarity and detail as a complete program, the North Carolina statutes relating to the repayment of attorneys' fees by restitution embody all the required features of a constitutionally acceptable approach. The indigent defendant's
                        fundamental right to counsel is preserved under the North Carolina statute and no preconditions are placed on the exercise of that right beyond a reasonable and minimally intrusive procedure designed to establish the fact of indigency.

                        Like its civil recoupment statute, North Carolina's procedures for imposing the reimbursement of court-appointed counsel fees as a condition of parole are narrowly drawn to avoid unfairness and discriminatory effects. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117

                        it may not require the defendant to make restitution while serving an active sentence. State v. Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 524 S.E.2d 63 (1999).

                    The Governor of North Carolina is authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of the State of North Carolina with any state of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Preamble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whereas: The Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers was established in 1937, it is the earliest corrections "compact" established among the states, and has not been amended since its adoption over 62 years ago;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whereas: This compact is the only vehicle for the controlled movement of adult parolees and probationers across state lines, and it currently has jurisdiction over more than a quarter of a million offenders;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whereas: The complexities of the compact have become more difficult to administer, and many jurisdictions have expanded supervision expectations to include currently unregulated practices such as victim input, victim notification requirements, and sex
                    offender registration;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whereas: After hearings, national surveys, and a detailed study by a task force appointed by the National Institute of Corrections, the overwhelming recommendation has been to amend the document to bring about an effective management capacity that addresses
                    public safety concerns and offender accountability;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whereas: The General Assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that this act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety. The Governor is hereby authorized and directed to enter into a compact on behalf of
                    the State of North Carolina with any state of the United States and other territorial possessions of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whereas: Upon the adoption of this Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, it is the intention of the General Assembly to repeal the previous Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers one year after the effective date
                    of this compact.

                    If a treaty in effect between the United States and a foreign country provides for the transfer or exchange of convicted offenders to the country of which the offenders are citizens or nationals, the Governor may, on behalf of the State and subject to
                    the terms of the treaty, authorize the Secretary of Public Safety to consent to the transfer or exchange of offenders and take any other action necessary to initiate the participation of the State in the treaty.
