     OFFICIAL COMMENTARY
    </b>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This Chapter replaces <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a></cite> of the North Carolina General Statutes. The Commission deals with the full range of contempt, both criminal and civil, for two
            reasons. First, criminal contempt is clearly within the subject matter which the Commission was charged to study, and many aspects of civil contempt are necessary to the enforcement of orders in criminal cases. Second, once the Commission
            began to deal with criminal contempt, it became necessary also to deal with civil contempt since the two are inextricably bound together in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a></cite>. The provisions
            in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5A</a></cite> are not directly drawn from any other statute, but they are drafted in light of Chapter 5 and of the American Bar Association's standards on
            the function of the trial judge. This Chapter does not carry forward the provisions of Chapter 5 which grant contempt powers to boards of county commissioners and the Utilities and Industrial Commissions. The application of those powers was
            sufficiently unclear under Chapter 5 that the Commission thought it best that those bodies either initiate statutes specifically dealing with that authority or that those bodies rely on court orders or criminal statutes dealing with the disruption
            of meetings.

      OFFICIAL COMMENTARY

            </h4>
            <p>
                The establishment of this Article represents one of the basic purposes of the Commission in drafting the Chapter on contempt - to draw a sharp distinction between proceedings for criminal contempt and the proceedings for civil contempt (or "as for contempt").
                This Article deals with those matters for which a sanction is imposed purely as punishment. The sanction occurs without regard to what the contemnor will do after imposition of the sanction.

        OFFICIAL COMMENTARY
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        This section is based on Section 5-1. Generally this section merely compresses the existing statement of grounds for criminal contempt, including the consolidation of previously separate grounds. Under subdivision (4), refusal to answer a question when
                        that answer is privileged would not be contempt since the refusal would be "legally justified." Subdivision (5) adds the clause "made with knowledge that it was false . . ." thus engrafting the standard of New York Times v. Sullivan,
                        376 U.S. 254 (1964), onto cases of alleged contempt in publishing reports of proceedings. Subdivision (7) does not have a counterpart in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a></cite>;
                        it was added to make clear, for example, that the failure to appear in court at the proper time by one, including counsel, whose nonappearance would interfere with the court's schedule, could be subject to criminal contempt. Subdivision
                        (9) is new and gives the court authority to step in immediately in cases of improper communication with jury. It is intended to complement the provision of a new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIIa30s14-225.1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-225.1</a></cite>,
                        enlarging the <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html" target="_blank">Chapter 14</a></cite> provisions dealing with jury tampering. The provisions of G.S. 5A-12(e) dictate the relationship between the two sanctions
                        for jury tampering. Subdivision (10) is also new and is intended to insure that this Chapter does not reject attempts elsewhere in the General Statutes to make certain acts criminal contempt. The final sentences of this section
                        are intended to effect the same purpose as the final two sentences of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html#t05s5-1" target="_blank">G.S. 5-1</a></cite>. Subsection (b) supplements or clarifies G.S. 5A-11(a)(4)
                        by prohibiting as punishment as contempt for a communication which does not pose a "clear and present danger" to justice. Subsection (c) operates as a reminder of the existence of another new provision, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7As0Va22As7A-276.1" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-276.1</a></cite>,
                        which prohibits "gag orders" of reports of open-court proceedings or of records required to be open to public inspection. Especially important is the final sentence of the section making such an order void, thus overcoming the
                        usual rule that a person subject to an order must comply with that order, even though it may be illegal, until a higher court declares its illegality.

         The power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts.

                        <p>
                            Statutory provisions regulating proceedings for contempt confer on the courts all the inherent powers to attach for contempt that were recognized by the common law as essential to the due and orderly exercise of their jurisdiction and functions. State

                            And Courts Cannot Be Deprived of Such Power. - It is essential for an effective administration of justice in an orderly and efficient way that the court possess certain powers to enforce its mandate. A legislative interference to the extent of depriving
                            the courts of these powers is tantamount to depriving the judicial department of the means of self-preservation and cannot be constitutionally justified. See Ex parte McCown, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 95</cite>,
                            51 S.E. 957 (1905); Snow v. Hawkes, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 365</cite>, 111 S.E. 621 (1922).

                            The power to punish for a contempt committed in the presence of the court, or near enough to impede its business, is essential to the existence of every court. In re Hennis, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 171
                            S.E.2d 211 (1969), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 571</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 785 (1970).

                        <p>
                            But Legislature May Regulate Same. - Contempt powers, as they existed at common law, while they may not be abrogated, may be reasonably regulated by legislation. Thus, statutes such as those in former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a></cite>                            were regulatory legislation upon the subject, and being in accord with modern doctrine, could not be assailed on the grounds of unconstitutionality. See In re Oldham, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 23</cite> (1883); In re Robinson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 533</cite>, 23 S.E. 453 (1895); In re Brown, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 417</cite>, 84 S.E. 690 (1915).

                        <p>
                            Limit of District Court's Authority. - A judge of the district court has no authority, except in his own district, to punish for contempt. In re Rhodes, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 518</cite> (1871); Morris v. Whitehead,
                            <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 637</cite> (1871).

                            Acts constituting contempt committed before a referee in supplementary proceedings are to be punished by the court making the reference. LaFontaine v. Southern Underwriters Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 132</cite> (1880).

                        <p>
                            Authority of Commissioner Not Exclusive. - The power of a commissioner, appointed by the court, to commit for refusal to testify is not given exclusively, if at all; but he may invoke the power of the judge, even though he may be given concurrent authority,
                            under statute. Bradley Fertilizer Co. v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 141</cite>, 17 S.E. 69 (1893).

                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">60 N.C. 440</cite> (1864); State v. Ownby, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 677</cite>, 61 S.E. 630 (1908); State v. Swink, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 726</cite>, 66 S.E. 448 (1909).

                            Contempt of Subordinate Officer Regarded as Contempt of Appointing Court. - A contempt against a subordinate officer appointed by a court, such as a commissioner, ordinarily is regarded as contempt of the authority of the appointing court, and the appointing
                            court has power to punish such contempt. This is true even where such subordinate officer is vested with the power to punish. Galyon v. Stutts, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 120</cite>, 84 S.E.2d
                            822 (1954).

                            Notice of Charges and Opportunity to Be Heard. - The principles of due process require that before an attorney is finally adjudicated in contempt and sentenced after a trial for conduct during the trial, he should have reasonable notice of the specific
                            charges and opportunity to be heard in his own behalf. In re Paul, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 353 S.E.2d 254, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 673</cite>, 356 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            The superior court judge was well within the bounds of the court's inherent authority to manage the case docket when he struck defendant's answer as sanction for willful failure to execute agreed settlement because defendants offered no plausible excuse
                            as to why they did not execute the two paragraph consent judgment, saying only that they did not understand it and in addition judge gave notice that failure to file consent order would result in the imposition of sanctions.

                        <p>
                            Failure to Comply with Schedules. - The trial judge has the power to hold a party in contempt for willful or grossly negligent failure to comply with schedules and practices of the court resulting in substantial interference with the business of the court.
                            Lomax v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 560, 400 S.E.2d 97 (1991).

                            Consecutive Sentences. - Trial court, upon finding defendant in direct criminal contempt on six occasions, did not err in sentencing defendant to six consecutive thirty-day terms of imprisonment because a finding of contempt was not a Class 3 misdemeanor.

                            Nature of Proceedings. - The fact that contemptuous conduct arises in a civil action does not alter the fact that contempt proceedings are criminal in nature. Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 503</cite>,

                            Although contempt of court, in its essential character, is divided into various kinds, such as direct or constructive, and civil or criminal, nevertheless in every species of contempt there is said to be necessarily inherent an element of offense against
                            the majesty of the law savoring more or less of criminality. Therefore it is said that the process by which the party charged is reached and tried is essentially criminal or quasi-criminal. Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v. Amalgamated

                            A contempt proceeding is sui generis. It is criminal in its nature in that the party is charged with doing something forbidden, and if found guilty, is punished. Mauney v. Mauney, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 254</cite>,

         Purpose.
        </b> - Punishments for contempt of court have two aspects, namely: (1) To vindicate the dignity of the court from disrespect shown to it or its orders; and (2) To compel the performance of some order or decree of the
                            court which it is in the power of the party to perform and which he refuses to obey. See In re Chiles, 89 U.S. 157, 22 L. Ed. 819 (1874); Bessette v. W.B. Conkey Co., 194 U.S. 324, 24 S. Ct. 665, 48 L. Ed. 997 (1904).

                            Contempt Proceeding as Part of Original Injunction Suit. - While some jurisdictions hold that a criminal contempt proceeding is independent and not a part of the case out of which the alleged contempt arose, there is authority that a contempt proceeding
                            based on the violation of an injunction, regardless of whether the proceeding is civil or criminal in nature, is a part of the original injunction suit and properly triable as such. Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v. Amalgamated Clothing

                            Criminal and Civil Contempt Distinguished. - Proceedings for contempt are of two classes, criminal and civil. Criminal proceedings are those brought to preserve the power and to vindicate the dignity of the court and to punish for disobedience of its
                            processes or orders. Civil proceedings are those instituted to preserve and enforce the rights of the parties to actions and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of the suitors. Galyon v. Stutts,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">241 N.C. 120</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 822 (1954).

                        <p>
                            Criminal contempt is a term applied where the judgment is in punishment of an act already accomplished, tending to interfere with the administration of justice. Civil contempt is a term applied where the proceeding is had to preserve and enforce the rights
                            of private parties to suits and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of such parties. Mauney v. Mauney, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 254</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 391 (1966);

                        <p>
                            Contempt proceedings are of two classes: those brought to vindicate the dignity and authority of the court; and those brought to enforce the rights of private parties. The former are as a rule held criminal in their nature and are generally governed by
                            the rules applicable to criminal cases. North Carolina v. Carr, 264 F. Supp. 75 (W.D.N.C. 1967), appeal dismissed, 386 F.2d 129 (4th Cir. 1967).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Criminal proceedings, involving as they do offenses against the courts and organized society, are punitive in their nature, and the government, the courts, and the people are interested in their prosecution. Whereas civil proceedings, having as their
                            underlying purpose the preservation of private rights, are primarily remedial and coercive in their nature, and are usually prosecuted at the instance of an aggrieved suitor. Galyon v. Stutts,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">241 N.C. 120</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 822 (1954).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Criminal contempt is the commission of an act tending to interfere with the administration of justice, while civil contempt is the remedy for the enforcement of orders in the equity jurisdiction of the court, and the willful refusal to pay alimony as
                            ordered by the court is civil contempt. Dyer v. Dyer, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 634</cite>, 197 S.E. 157 (1938).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A major factor in determining whether contempt is civil or criminal is the purpose for which the power is exercised. Where the punishment is to preserve the court's authority and to punish disobedience of its orders, it is criminal contempt. Where the
                            purpose is to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order, the contempt is civil. O'Briant v. O'Briant, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 432</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 370
                            (1985).

                            into civil relief.

                            Order Allowing Defendant to Avoid Confinement by Paying Arrearages Held Remedial Relief. - Where the court ordered defendant confined in jail for a period of 29 days, but it allowed defendant to avoid that punishment altogether by paying the entire amount
                            of child support arrearages, this constituted remedial relief and therefore required that the court's order be construed as adjudicating defendant in civil contempt.

                            Notice of Charges and Opportunity to Be Heard. - Before an attorney is finally adjudicated in contempt and sentenced after trial for conduct during trial, he should have reasonable notice of the specific charges and opportunity to be heard in his own

                            When Notice and Hearing Are Required. - Summary proceedings are appropriate for punishing direct contempt when necessary to restore order or maintain the dignity and authority of the court and when the measures are imposed substantially contemporaneously
                            with the contempt; however, in cases where a court does not act immediately to punish acts constituting direct contempt or where the contempt is indirect, notice and a hearing are required. O'Briant v. O'Briant,

                            In contempt actions where the defendant is not punished summarily or where the contemptuous act does not occur in the presence of the judge or legislative body, principles of due process require reasonable notice of a charge and opportunity to be heard

                            A person guilty of any of the acts or omissions enumerated in this section may be punished for contempt, because such acts or omissions have a direct tendency to interrupt the proceedings of the court or to impair the respect due to its authority. Luther

                            "Willful" and "Unlawful" Distinguished. - The word "willful", when used in a statute creating an offense, implies the doing of the act purposely and deliberately in violation of law. The term "unlawfully" implies that an act is done or not done as the
                            law allows or requires, while the term "willfully" implies that the act is done knowingly and of stubborn purpose. In re Hege, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 625</cite>, 172 S.E. 345 (1934); Clayton

                            In order for an act to be "willful," as the term is used in criminal law, it must be done deliberately and purposefully in violation of law, and without authority, justification or excuse. State v. Chriscoe, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite>                            155, 354 S.E.2d 289 (1987).

                            brought about by her mother's failure to arrive on time or to answer the telephone, defendant's behavior did not rise to the level of willfulness or gross negligence.

                            Trial court properly held defendant in criminal contempt of court and in sentencing him to 30 days in jail because during a witness's testimony, he disrupted the court proceedings by willfully making a hand gesture as to be pointing a gun to his head,
                            and two exhibits were used to corroborate the testimony of the State's witnesses. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 237, 817 S.E.2d 907 (2018).

                            Employment of Individual to Disrupt Criminal Trial. - Evidence held sufficient to support the trial judge's finding that respondent attorney solicited an individual to disrupt the criminal trial of his client, thereby committing willful behavior during
                            the sitting of a court which tended to interrupt its proceedings, in violation of subsection (a) of this section. In re Paul, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 353 S.E.2d 254, cert.

                            Assaulting Judge During Recess of Court. - Where the respondent visited the judge at his boardinghouse during a recess of the court, before the adjournment of the term and assaulted the judge, it was held that this conduct was a direct contempt of the
                            court as much as if the assault had been committed in the court during trial. Ex parte McCown, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 95</cite>, 51 S.E. 957 (1905).

                            who in the line of their duty are assisting the court in the dispatch of its business. State v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 743</cite>, 94 S.E. 680 (1917); Snow v. Hawkes, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 365</cite>,

                            Willfulness Not Shown. - Because defendant did not exhibit a bad faith disregard for the trial court's authority by failing to silence a cell phone during the court proceedings, and because defendant's question of a client was logical in terms of context,
                            it did not appear that defendant's actions were willful or intended to mislead anyone present; accordingly, the trial court erred in finding defendant in contempt under G.S. 5A-11(a)(1), (2). State v. Phair,

         Deliberate Disobedience Irrespective of Intent.
        </b> - Attorney willfully disobeyed a lawful order of the court in a manner that was likely to interrupt the matters before the court where he deliberately disobeyed the judge's repeated orders to sit down and be quiet,
                            and while it was unlikely that he intended any insult or injury to the court, he consciously disobeyed direct orders and was properly convicted of criminal contempt. Nakell v. Attorney Gen., 15 F.3d 319 (4th Cir.), cert. denied,

                            into civil relief. However, specifically conditioning the imposition or effect of the probationary or suspended sentence upon the contemnor's purging himself would constitute civil relief. Bishop v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                            499, 369 S.E.2d 106 (1988).

                            Impossibility to Comply with Order or Process. - Where disobedience to process or order is due to circumstances which make it impossible for the contemnor to obey such order or process, he may not be punished for contempt. Thus where the clerk issued
                            a notice to the respondent to produce a certain will which was in the custody of some other clerk, it was held that the order to adjudge the respondent guilty of contempt was reversible on appeal. In re Scarborough's Will,

                        <p>
                            The defendant must have been able to obey the order, and in spite of his ability must have disobeyed it. Inability to obey is a good excuse. Kane v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 1</cite> (1872); Boyett v. Vaughan,

                            Order Allowing Defendant to Avoid Confinement by Paying Arrearages Held Remedial Relief. - Where the court ordered defendant confined in jail for a period of 29 days, but it allowed defendant to avoid that punishment altogether by paying the entire amount
                            of child support arrearages, this constituted remedial relief and therefore required that the court's order be construed as adjudicating defendant in civil contempt. Bishop v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                            499, 369 S.E.2d 106 (1988).

                            Alimony and Support Payments. - Where defendant testified that his failure after knowledge to obey a court order for the payment of alimony pendente lite was due to his lack of financial means, and no evidence was presented at the hearing tending to negative
                            the truth of defendant's explanation or to establish as an affirmative fact that he possessed the means wherewith to comply with the order, the court's finding that defendant willfully disobeyed the order was not supported
                            by the record, and judgment committing him to imprisonment for contempt would be set aside. Lamm v. Lamm, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 248</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 403 (1948).

                            Where the husband, in proceedings against him for contempt for disobeying an order to pay moneys for the support of his child, showed by the uncontradicted testimony of himself and a witness that he had no property nor income except what he could earn,
                            and that he had been unable to obtain employment and was therefore unable to comply with the terms of the order, the evidence failed to show that the disobedience was willful, and he could not be adjudged in contempt of court.

                        <p>
                            The mere fact that defendant, ordered to pay a certain sum monthly for the necessary subsistence of his wife and child, has a right to move at any time for modification of the order does not support the conclusion that defendant's failure to comply with
                            the order is willful. Smithwick v. Smithwick, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 503</cite>, 11 S.E.2d 455 (1940).

                            Failure to Comply with Separation Agreement. - Husband could not be adjudged in contempt for failure to comply with separation agreement entered into prior to the institution of divorce action, judgment in which provided that it should not affect or invalidate
                            the separation agreement. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 556</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 529 (1944).

                            Disavowal of Disrespectful Intent. - The willful disobedience of a restraining order by the party on whom it had been served, and who was aware of its meaning and import, is in itself an act of contempt, from which he may not purge himself by disavowing
                            a disrespectful intent. In re Parker, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 463</cite>, 99 S.E. 342 (1919).

         Violation of Courtroom Policy by Streaming.
        </b> - Defendant's actions supported the trial court's finding of criminal contempt because it was evident that defendant had a clear understanding of courtroom policy, yet defendant willfully disregarded prior warnings
                            and the posted policy by recording inside the courtroom as defendant knowingly carried a device and entered the courtroom with the intention of live streaming the courtroom proceedings, after being given express warnings, in

                            Advice of Counsel No Excuse. - The failure to obey the order of the court placing property in possession of a receiver is contempt, even though the contemnor acted under an advice of counsel. Such advice is no protection to the intentional violation of
                            the order. Delozier v. Bird, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 689</cite>, 31 S.E. 834 (1898).

                            In such a case the counsel himself may be subjected to contempt proceedings. This fact, however, will be considered by the judge in imposing the punishment. Weston v. John L. Roper Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 270</cite>,

                            An order of court not lawfully issued may not be the basis on which to found a proceeding for contempt. Patterson v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 481</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 658 (1949); State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 154</cite>,

                            Where an order is void ab initio, one may not be held for contempt for disobeying such order, and the fact that he did not appeal from the granting of the order does not affect his liability, the order not being one lawfully issued. In re Longley,

                            Where a subpoena issued by a municipal-county court and running outside the county was a nullity because not attested by the seal of the court, neither service of the process nor voluntary appearance thereunder could waive the defect or vitalize the process
                            so as to make the willful disobedience of the subpoena a basis for contempt proceedings. State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 154</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 621 (1950).

                            Upon application for custody of children after decree of divorce, the resident judge entered a temporary order awarding the custody to the father, and issued an order to defendant wife to appear outside the county and outside the district to show cause
                            why the temporary order should not be made permanent. It was held that the judge was without jurisdiction to hear the matter outside the district, and an order issued upon the hearing of the order to show cause was void ab

                            defendant's contempt, if any, in failing to provide the required materials could be criminal or civil, and contemnor waived procedural requirements when he came into court to answer charges of the trial court's show cause order.

                            that these had been destroyed by rats, and that therefore he had no records or documents with which to comply with the order, and there was no evidence to the contrary, it was error for the court to find and conclude that defendant

                            Defendant Not Subjected to Improper Burden of Proof. - Defendant was not subjected to an improper burden of proof under G.S. 5A-15(f) in finding that defendant was in criminal contempt under G.S. 5A-11(a)(3), as defendant admitted that defendant was ordered
                            to stay out of the judges' offices and that defendant entered an area of the courthouse marked "Judges Offices" to file an emergency motion with the trial court administrator; there was no issue of fact to be decided, and thus
                            no burden of proof was placed on defendant, as the trial court properly required proof beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant's contempt of court. State v. Simon, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite>                            247, 648 S.E.2d 853 (2007).

                            Defendant Properly Found in Criminal Contempt. - Defendant was properly found in criminal contempt under G.S. 5A-11(a)(3) as: (1) G.S. 5A-11(a)(3) did not require that a finding of criminal contempt be predicated upon the failure to obey a written order;
                            (2) the practical effect of a show cause order was the same as if it had noticed a first judge's order; (3) defendant was ordered not to visit the judges' office about the case any further, yet defendant entered the courthouse
                            area marked "Judges' Office" to hand deliver an emergency motion to the trial court administrator; (4) defendant knew defendant was to stay out of the judges' office area where the trial court administrator's office was located;
                            and (5) defendant's claim that defendant should not have been held in contempt because defendant's purpose for being in the trial court administrator's office was to leave an emergency motion for the trial court administrator

                            Findings by a trial court supported the determination that a former wife was in willful contempt pursuant to G.S. 5A-11(a)(3) for her failure to allow her former husband to exercise visitation with the parties' child, as she claimed she did not receive
                            the husband's notice of his intent to exercise visitation but she had received it, she hid the minor child when the husband came to visit, and her claim that the husband could not safely drive due to a brain tumor was shown
                            to lack merit by medical evidence. File v. File, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 562, 673 S.E.2d 405 (2009).

                            Conduct proscribed by the felony secret peeping statute constitutes a "sexual offense," and subject to the express limitation that a defendant's actions are for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of any person; therefore, defendant
                            was in indirect criminal contempt of a custody consent order because she willfully allowed her children in the presence of her boyfriend, who was a "convicted sex offender" as provided in the order based on his conviction for
                            felony secret peeping, even if he was not required to register as a sex offender. The record showed that the inclusion of the "convicted sex offender" language in the consent order was specifically targeted at defendant's relationship

                            trial court had jurisdiction to consider criminal contempt based on corporation manager's repeated violations of the court's orders. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite>                            318, 396 S.E.2d 92 (1990).

                            Refusal to Testify After Having Been Sworn. - It has been uniformly held by the Supreme Court and by courts of other jurisdictions that the power to punish for contempt committed in the presence of the court is inherent in the court, and not dependent
                            upon statutory authority. Without such power the court cannot perform its judicial function. This principle is especially applicable when the contempt consists in the refusal of the witness in attendance upon the court, after
                            having been duly sworn, to answer a question propounded to him for the purpose of eliciting evidence material to the issue to be decided by the court. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Since the power of the court over a witness in requiring proper responses is inherent and necessary for the furtherance of justice, it must be conceded that testimony which is obviously false or evasive is equivalent to a refusal to testify. In re Edison,
                            <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 190 S.E.2d 235 (1972).

                            or evasive is equivalent to a refusal to testify. Galyon v. Stutts, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 120</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 822 (1954).

                            Although It Is Also a Crime. - Making a false statement under oath may constitute contempt, notwithstanding that the conduct may also be a crime, such as perjury or false swearing. In re Edison, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite>                            354, 190 S.E.2d 235 (1972).

                            Commissioner May Ask Aid of Judge. - The commissioner before whom the witness had refused to answer may invoke the aid of the judge to punish for contempt. But the judge has no right to delegate the judicial power to punish for contempt to an executive
                            officer. Bradley Fertilizer Co. v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 141</cite>, 17 S.E. 69 (1893).

                            No Distinction Between Refusing to Be Sworn and Refusing to Answer. - This section makes no distinction between one who, in the presence of the court, pursuant to its lawful subpoena, refuses to be sworn as a witness and one who, having been sworn, refuses
                            to answer a proper question. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                            Motive of Recalcitrant Witness Immaterial. - Whatever the motive of the recalcitrant witness or party may be, it does not determine whether he may lawfully be adjudged in contempt and punishment. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>,
                            152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                            The refusal of one subpoenaed as a witness to take the oath or to answer proper questions propounded to him, when done knowingly and intentionally, is willful even though such person believes it to be his moral duty to refuse to testify. In re Williams,

                            Decrease in Esteem No Justification for Refusing to Testify. - The fact that one called as a witness fears that his testimony may decrease the esteem in which he is held in the community, or may decrease his ability to render service therein, does not
                            justify refusal by him to testify in response to questions otherwise proper. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137,

                            Nor Religious Conscience. - The State has a compelling interest that a person called as a witness should be sworn and should testify in the administration of justice between the State and one charged with a serious offense; therefore a minister called
                            as a witness in such prosecution may be held in contempt of court upon his refusal to be sworn as a witness, notwithstanding he asserts that his refusal is a matter of religious conscience. In re Williams,

                            and (3) the non-party offered no evidence explaining the non-party's absence from the deposition. First Mt. Vernon Indus. Loan Ass'n v. ProDev XXII, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite>                            126, 703 S.E.2d 836 (2011).

                            a reasonable doubt standard was actually applied; the failure to make such an indication made the contempt orders fatally deficient. State v. Ford, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 566,

                        Subsection (b) is drawn from the recommendations of the American Bar Association. It intends to preclude fine or punishment in response to what is essentially innocent conduct although censure alone would still be possible. Subsection (c) makes clear
                        that a judge may change his mind and reduce or remove any punishment he imposed in response to contempt. Subsection (d) makes clear that, although civil contempt and criminal contempt proceedings are distinct, each may be imposed
                        for the same conduct.

                        and made related punctuation and stylistic changes; in subdivision (a)(2), substituted "Chapter 15A of the General Statutes" for "G.S. 15A"; and added subdivision (a)(3).

                        No Constitutional Right to Jury Trial. - In view of the punishment, contempt is a petty offense for which there is no constitutional right to a jury trial. Thompson v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 212
                        S.E.2d 243, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 120</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 606 (1975).

                        Punishment Immediate. - The punishment in contempt cases must be immediate, or it would be ineffectual, as it is designed to suppress an outrage which impedes the business of the court. State v. Yancy, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. 133</cite>                        (1814); Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v.

                    <p>
                        Punishment for Criminal and Civil Contempt Distinguished. - Criminal contempt is administered as punishment for acts already committed that have impeded the administration of justice in some way. And as is the case with all offenses of a criminal nature,
                        the punishment that courts can impose therefor, either by fine or imprisonment, is circumscribed by law. Civil contempt, on the other hand, is employed to coerce disobedient defendants into complying with orders of court, and the
                        length of time that a defendant can be imprisoned in a proper case is not limited by law, since the defendant can obtain his release immediately upon complying with the court's order. Brower v. Brower,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 131, 318 S.E.2d 542 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A major factor in determining whether contempt is criminal or civil is the purpose for which the power is exercised. Where the punishment is to preserve the court's authority and to punish disobedience of its orders, it is criminal contempt. Where the
                        purpose is to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order, the contempt is civil. The importance in distinguishing criminal and civil contempt lies in the difference in procedure, punishment and
                        right of review. Bishop v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 369 S.E.2d 106 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contempt may be of two kinds, civil or criminal, although the demarcation between the two may be hazy at best. Criminal contempt is generally applied where the judgment is in punishment of an act already accomplished, tending to interfere with the administration
                        of justice. Civil contempt is a term applied where the proceeding is had to preserve the rights of private parties and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of such parties. Bishop v. Bishop,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 369 S.E.2d 106 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Treatment of Civil Contempt. - Where the court finds that a defendant is in civil contempt, it is not limited by this section to imposing a 30-day sentence for criminal contempt. It can, under G.S. 5A-21(b), order his imprisonment until he purges himself
                        of contempt. Bennett v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 322 S.E.2d 439 (1984).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Punishment of One Act as Both Criminal and Civil Contempt. - As recognized in subsection (d) of this section and G.S. 5A-21(c), a person may be found to be in both criminal and civil contempt, although only a single act was committed. Lowder v. All Star
                        Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 263 S.E.2d 624 (1980), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 561</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 247 (1981).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One act may be punishable both as civil contempt and as criminal contempt. This kind of duality particularly inheres in a party litigant's willful failure to comply with a discovery order. Punishment is not, therefore, limited to criminal sanctions. Willis
                        v. Duke Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 19</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 191 (1976).

                    <p>
                        Defendant was not improperly found in civil and criminal contempt for the same acts because defendant was found in civil contempt for continued conduct and in criminal contempt for past conduct. State v. Revels, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite>                        754, 793 S.E.2d 744 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Decision Not to Prosecute For Criminal Contempt - Defendant claimed that his prosecution for failure to appear violated his due process rights under N.C. Const. art. I,
                        <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 19, where he was prosecuted under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Va26s15A-543" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-543</a></cite>, and he could have been punished for failure to appear under the criminal
                        contempt statute, G.S. 5A-12(a); however, because there was evidence from which a jury could have found that defendant violated either <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Va26s15A-543" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-543</a></cite>                        or G.S. 5A-12(a), it was within the prosecutor's discretion to decide under which statute the State wished to proceed. State v. Dammons, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 284, 583 S.E.2d 606 (2003), review denied,
                        <cite

                    <p>
                        No Defense to Criminal Prosecution. - The fact that a person has been punished for contempt of court is no defense to a criminal indictment for the act constituting the contempt. State v. Yancy, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. 133</cite>                        (1814); In re Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 225</cite>, 3 S.E. 515 (1887).

                        Provision in a criminal contempt adjudication requiring defendant to pay $3,150 in damages to plaintiff was invalid, because this section limits the punishment that can be imposed for criminal contempts to a fine of $500 and 30 days in jail; and damages

        Probation Conditions for Contempt Violation.
       </b> - Given defendant's questionable and intentional courtroom conduct, defendant's frequent visits to the courtroom, and defendant's direct willingness to disobey courtroom policies, no abuse of discretion was discerned
                        in the trial court's decision to impose conditions on defendant's one-year probationary sentence for criminal contempt. The conditions were reasonably related to the necessity of preventing further disruptions of the court by defendant's

                        This section specifies that only direct criminal contempt may be the subject of summary proceedings and defines direct criminal contempt. The three factors listed in subsection (a)(1), (2) and (3) must all be present before an act can be direct contempt.
                        Subsection (a) also permits the judge who is authorized to punish summarily to defer the proceedings if he choose. The last sentence of subsection (a) establishes the rule that a person be cited for contempt at the time the contempt
                        occurs even if the proceedings are to be held later.

                        When Notice and Hearing Are Required. - Summary proceedings are appropriate for punishing direct contempt when necessary to restore order or maintain the dignity and authority of the court and when the measures are imposed substantially contemporaneously
                        with the contempt; however, in cases where a court does not act immediately to punish acts constituting direct contempt or where the contempt is indirect, notice and a hearing is required. O'Briant v. O'Briant,

                        Trial court had jurisdiction to find defendant in criminal contempt because, as statutorily required, the court's show cause order required defendant to appear and explain defendant's noncompliance with court orders. State v. Revels,

                        False Testimony as Direct or Indirect Contempt. - Where all the facts necessary to establish false testimony were not before the court, it was impossible to say that there were words spoken or acts committed in the actual presence of the court which would
                        constitute direct contempt. In re Edison, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 190 S.E.2d 235 (1972), decided under former statutory provisions.

                        Indirect Contempt. - Indirect contempt is that which arises from matters not occurring in or near the presence of the court, but which tend to obstruct or defeat the administration of justice.

                        Failure to comply with a prior court order would amount to an act committed outside the presence of the court, at a distance from it, which tends to degrade the court or interrupts, prevents or impedes the administration of justice and would be classified
                        an indirect contempt. Ingle v. Ingle, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 197 S.E.2d 61 (1973), decided under former G.S. 5-7; Lowder v.

                        the criminal contempt order was facially deficient, and a criminal contempt judgment entered upon that order was likewise deficient. State v. Tincher, - N.C. App. - , 831 S.E.2d 859 (2019).

                        Penalty for Direct and Indirect Contempt the Same; Thus, No Reversible Error. - In a quiet title action wherein the defendants testified in the trial court's presence, which constituted direct criminal contempt, but the trial court mistakenly held them
                        in indirect criminal contempt, such error was not grounds for reversal as the penalty was the same for both direct and indirect criminal contempt. Adams Creek Assocs. v.

                        not contain any findings satisfying a requisite for such, and thus the court reviewed the order to see if defendant was convicted of indirect criminal contempt. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite>                        382, 750 S.E.2d 43 (2013).

                        of an inability to pay, including the father's medical condition and minimal living expenses and lack of income, (2) the orders' findings did not support a conclusion that the father willfully refused to pay or had the ability

                        If the contempt proceedings are to be summary, subsection (a) requires that they occur substantially at the same time as the contempt itself. Subsection (b) follows the American Bar Association recommendation that the person charged with contempt be given
                        notice of what the contemptuous action was and an opportunity to respond. This was intended not to provide for a hearing, or anything approaching that, in summary contempt proceedings, but merely to assure that the alleged contemnor
                        had an opportunity to point out instances of gross mistake about who committed the contemptuous act or matters of that sort.

                        Constitutionality. - Summary punishment for direct contempt committed in the presence of the court does not contemplate a trial at which the person charged with contempt must be represented by counsel, and therefore sentence for contempt does not deprive
                        the contemnor of his liberty without due process of law. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

                        The term "substantially contemporaneously with the contempt" in subsection (a) of this section is construed in light of its legislative purpose of meeting due process safeguards. The word "substantially" qualifies the word "contemporaneously," and clearly
                        does not require that the contempt proceedings immediately follow the misconduct. Factors bearing on the time lapse include the contemnor's notice or knowledge of the charged misconduct, the nature of the misconduct, and other
                        circumstances that may have some bearing upon the defendant's right to a fair and timely hearing. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 592, 279 S.E.2d 77, cert. denied and appeal dismissed,

        Failure to Provide Notice and Opportunity to be Heard.

                        contained a pre-printed finding that the contemnor was given summary notice of the charges and summary opportunity to respond but the record directly contradicted the form language, showing instead that judgment and sentence were
                        imposed without notice and no opportunity to be heard was given. State v. Perkinson, - N.C. App. - , 844 S.E.2d 336 (2020).

                        It is implicit in this section that the judicial official's findings in a summary contempt proceeding should clearly reflect that the contemnor was given an opportunity to be heard, along with a summary of whatever response was made and the judicial official's
                        finding that the excuse or explanation proffered was inadequate or disbelieved. State v. Verbal, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 306, 254 S.E.2d 794 (1979).

                        the failure to make such an indication made the contempt orders fatally deficient. State v. Ford, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 596 S.E.2d 846 (2004).

                        When a judicial official chooses not to proceed summarily against a person charged with direct criminal contempt or when he may not proceed summarily, he may proceed by an order directing the person to appear before a judge at a reasonable time specified
                        in the order and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court. A copy of the order must be furnished to the person charged. If the criminal contempt is based upon acts before a judge which so involve him that his objectivity
                        may reasonably be questioned, the order must be returned before a different judge.

                        This section provides for a show-cause hearing in instances in which the judge either chooses not to proceed by summary proceedings or may not so proceed because the contempt was not direct. Plenary proceedings may not be held by a magistrate or clerk;
                        they must always be held before a judge. The final sentence of subsection (a) responds to the constitutional requirement of Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194 (1968), that contempt proceedings be held before another judge when the
                        one citing the contemnor was involved in the act in question. Subsection (f) permits the judge, in addition to using the prosecutor, who traditionally represents the court in contempt actions, to appoint another member of the Bar
                        when there is a conflict of interest. The central example of this would be when the prosecutor himself or a law-enforcement officer with whom he worked closely was involved in the contempt.

                        Notice of Charges and Opportunity to Be Heard. - The principles of due process require that before an attorney is finally adjudicated in contempt and sentenced after a trial for conduct during the trial, he should have reasonable notice of the specific
                        charges and opportunity to be heard in his own behalf. In re Paul, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 353 S.E.2d 254, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 673</cite>, 356 S.E.2d 779 (1987),

                        Trial court had jurisdiction to find defendant in criminal contempt because, as statutorily required, the court's show cause order required defendant to appear and explain defendant's noncompliance with court orders. State v. Revels,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 793 S.E.2d 744 (2016).

                        When Notice and Hearing Are Required. - Summary proceedings are appropriate for punishing direct contempt when necessary to restore order or maintain the dignity and authority of the court and when the measures are imposed substantially contemporaneously
                        with the contempt; however, in cases where a court does not act immediately to punish acts constituting direct contempt or where the contempt is indirect, notice and a hearing is required. O'Briant v. O'Briant,

                            class="nc_code">313 N.C. 432</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 370 (1985).

                        governed the appropriate procedure. O'Briant v. O'Briant, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 432</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 370 (1985).

        Reasonable Doubt Standard.
       </b> - Trial court properly held defendant in criminal contempt for failure to appear and testify in accordance with subpoenas served on her because, while the subpoena personally served on her contained only the first page,
                        and the protections required by statute were on the missing second page, the subpoena was properly served via telephone by a member of the county sheriff's department, the trial court was not required to make any findings of improper
                        conduct before issuing a show cause order, and the trial court used the reasonable doubt standard when presenting its findings in open court. State v. Gonzalez, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 6, 2021).

                    <p>
                        Beyond a Reasonable Doubt Standard Required. - Although the trial court made numerous findings about defendant's inexcusable behavior, none of the findings indicated that the trial court used the beyond a reasonable standard of proof, nor was there a
                        finding of guilt; the trial court's failure to indicate that it applied beyond a reasonable doubt as the standard of proof in finding facts, as required by the statute, rendered the contempt order fatally deficient. State v. Phillips,
                        <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 750 S.E.2d 43 (2013).

                        What findings of fact must include - Superior court order from a plenary proceeding of contempt under G.S. 5A-15(f) must indicate that the reasonable doubt standard of proof was applied to the findings of fact; failure to make such an indication is fatally
                        deficient, unless the proceeding is of a limited instance where there were no factual determinations for the court to make. State v. Ford, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 596 S.E.2d 846 (2004).

                        Defendant Not Subjected to Improper Burden of Proof. - Defendant was not subjected to an improper burden of proof under G.S. 5A-15(f) in finding that defendant was in criminal contempt under G.S. 5A-11(a)(3), as defendant admitted that defendant was ordered
                        to stay out of the judges' offices and that defendant entered an area of the courthouse marked "Judges Offices" to file an emergency motion with the trial court administrator; there was no issue of fact to be decided, and thus
                        no burden of proof was placed on defendant, as the trial court properly required proof beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant's contempt of court. State v. Simon, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite>                        247, 648 S.E.2d 853 (2007).

                        Verification Not Prerequisite to Issuance of Show Cause Order. - The filing of a petition, an affidavit, or other proper verification is not required as a prerequisite to issuance of a show cause order under this section, although they may be a proper
                        basis for issuance of the show cause order. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 263 S.E.2d 624 (1980), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 561</cite>,

                        Service Held Proper. - Where the court issued an order pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 4(j)(1)c notifying a foreign attorney of the contempt
                        charges and allowing him 60 days to respond to the charges, which order was mailed to the attorney at the address he gave the court in a motion to be admitted in a case pro hac vice, this method of service was proper to comply
                        with the requirement of subsection (a) that "[a] copy of the order must be furnished to the person charged", where the court had personal jurisdiction as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIIAa6As1-75.4" target="_blank">G.S. 1-75.4</a></cite>.

                        Order Finding Attorney in Criminal Contempt was Erroneous. - Trial court erred in finding the attorney to be in criminal contempt because G.S. 5A-15(a) required the show cause order to be returned before a different judge when the circumstances cited
                        in the statute caused the objectivity of the presiding judge to be reasonably questioned and, in the instant action, there was a reasonable possibility that, had the order been returned before a different judge, a different result
                        would have been reached. In re Marshall, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 662 S.E.2d 5 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Attorney was erroneously found in criminal contempt because the trial court did not follow the procedures required by G.S. 5A-15. Ge Betz, Inc. v. Conrad, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 752 S.E.2d 634 (2013).

        Recusal of Judge in Contempt Hearing.
       </b> - Absent facts to suggest bias or impartiality toward defendant, the trial judge's decision to deny defendant's motion for recusal was affirmed because the colloquy between the judge and defense counsel reflected that
                        the judge considered the judge's position as the trier of fact and determined that the judge was able to preside over the criminal contempt hearing in an objective, impartial manner. In re Eldridge, - N.C. App. - , 836 S.E.2d 859
                        (2019), review denied, 837 S.E.2d 883, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 112 (N.C. 2020); aff'd, 854 S.E.2d 579, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 172 (N.C. 2021).

                        Appellate Review. - Trial court's order did not specify whether defendant was found guilty of direct or indirect criminal contact, but the order did not support a conclusion of direct criminal contempt, as the order did not contain any findings satisfying
                        a requisite for such, and thus the court reviewed the order to see if defendant was convicted of indirect criminal contempt. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 750 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        The authority for taking custody of a person charged with contempt has been unclear. This section is aimed to fill that gap. Subsection (a) clarifies the legality of seizing a person charged with direct contempt and bringing him before the judge. Subsection
                        (b) makes clear the propriety of issuing an order for arrest of a person when the proceedings are not to be summary. A concurrent change in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIIa17s15A-305" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-305</a></cite>,
                        providing for the order for arrest, makes clear that an order may be used for this purpose.

                        Jurisdiction. - This section vests exclusive jurisdiction in the superior court to hear appeals from orders in the district court holding a person in criminal contempt. Michael v. Michael, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                        841, 336 S.E.2d 414 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 195</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 577 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Criminal contempt orders are properly appealed from district court to the superior court, not to the Court of Appeals. Hancock v. Hancock, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 471 S.E.2d 415 (1996).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because neither the appellant, nor the appellant's trial counsel challenged the decision of the trial court judge, either at the end of a recusal hearing or in the appellant's notice of appeal, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review the appellant's
                        arguments. State v. Okwara, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 733 S.E.2d 576 (2012).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to hear a father's appeal of a district court's criminal contempt finding because the father's only recourse was to appeal to a superior court. Summerville v. Summerville, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite>                        228, 814 S.E.2d 887 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review the trial court's contempt order, finding a former husband in criminal contempt for failure to pay spousal support, but not in contempt for failure to pay child support, because it was unclear whether the
                        order was grounded in civil or criminal contempt, the former wife failed to articulate any basis for appealing the order, and failed to present any adequate basis to determine the appellate court's jurisdiction. Hardy v. Hardy,
                        - N.C. App. - , 842 S.E.2d 148 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Standard of review de novo. - Neither the trial court's findings in the summary proceeding, nor the superior court's findings in the plenary proceeding, conducted de novo pursuant to G.S. 5A-17, specifically indicated that the beyond a reasonable doubt
                        standard was actually applied; the failure to make such an indication made the contempt orders fatally deficient. State v. Ford, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 596 S.E.2d 846 (2004).
                        <br />

                        Criminal Contempt. - Father's appeal of that portion of a trial court's contempt order finding him in criminal contempt was not properly before the appellate court, which dismissed that portion of the father's appeal. McKinney v. McKinney,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 799 S.E.2d 280 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Appealability of Acquittal of Criminal Contempt. - In a domestic relations case in which plaintiff sought to have defendant's attorney held in contempt for harboring a child for the purpose of resisting and interfering with a court order granting temporary
                        custody to the plaintiff, the charges were in the nature of criminal contempt, and the court's order finding that the attorney's conduct did not constitute contempt was not appealable, since the acquittal did not affect any substantial
                        right of the plaintiff. Patterson v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 289 S.E.2d 48 (1982).

                        Finding of Fact Not Disturbed. - Where the judge has found sufficient facts to attach the defendant for direct contempt of court, upon imposing punishment therefor, the finding will not be disturbed by appeal. In re Deaton,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">105 N.C. 59</cite>, 11 S.E. 244 (1890); State v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 743</cite>, 94 S.E. 680 (1917).

                    <p>
                        The finding of fact by the judge will not be disturbed upon an appeal on an indirect contempt. In re Parker, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 463</cite>, 99 S.E. 342 (1919).

                        On appeals from a subordinate court to the superior court, the facts as well as the law will be reviewed, and even additional testimony may be heard. In re Deaton, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 59</cite>, 11 S.E. 244 (1890).

            <p>
                The Commission felt that it was proper, once they had to deal with civil contempt in some respect as a consequence of severing it in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a></cite> from the
                related criminal contempt provisions, to resolve some of the uncertainties that surround the present civil contempt procedures.

        OFFICIAL COMMENTARY
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        This section is based on the Commission's recognition that civil contempt should be solely a matter of forcing the contemnor to comply with a court order and, unlike criminal contempt, is not a form of punishment. Subsections (a) and (b) make clear that
                        civil contempt is appropriate only so long as the court order is capable of being complied with. The section rejects the approach of the present <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a></cite>                        specifying particular grounds for civil contempt. Instead, the only issue in determining whether imprisonment for civil contempt is proper is whether or not there is a court order which may be complied with. Subdivision (3) of
                        subsection (a), by specifying that the contempt continues while the person is "able to take reasonable measures that would enable him to comply," is intended to make clear, for example, that the person who does not have the money
                        to make court-ordered payments but who could take a job which would enable him to make those payments, remains in contempt by not taking such a job. In most cases, a person in civil contempt may be held for so long as his civil
                        contempt continues; he holds the keys to his own jail by virtue of his ability to comply. The Commission felt, however, in the case of failure to comply with nontestimonial identification order by one who is only suspected of a
                        crime, that this unlimited jailing would be improper. Therefore, unless probable cause for arrest arises, the person subject to a nontestimonial identification order who remains noncompliant must be released after 90 days. Concurrent
                        amendments to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa14s15A-279" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-279</a></cite> (the section dealing with nontestimonial identification orders) point out that resisting compliance
                        with a nontestimonial identification order may be used in determining whether there is probable cause that the person subject to the order committed the crime in question. This means that in many cases the person who resists the
                        order for the full 90 day period will become subject to arrest on probable cause, at which time the 90 day limitation will no longer apply. Another concurrent amendment to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa14s15A-279" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-279</a></cite>                        provides, however, that a nontestimonial identification order may not be reissued unless there is newly available evidence to support it. In subsection (c), the Commission was seeking to insure that a person could not serve a longer
                        period of imprisonment by being found in both civil and criminal contempt for the same conduct than he could if he had been found to be in only civil or criminal contempt. An earlier draft of this subsection had specified that
                        a finding of civil or criminal contempt did not preclude disciplinary proceedings if the contemnor were a member of the Bar. The Commission approved this policy but felt it more appropriate that it be mentioned in commentary rather
                        than in the body of the section.

                            Acts and omissions constituting civil contempt involve matters tending to defeat, impair, impede, or prejudice the rights or remedies of a party to an action pending in court, and are punishable with the underlying purpose of preserving private rights
                            by coercion. Galyon v. Stutts, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 120</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 822 (1954).

                            When the trial court ordered defendant to either pay plaintiff $400 or serve thirty days in jail for willfully refusing to pay postseparation support to plaintiff, the action was for defendant's failure to comply with the trial court's previous order,
                            and it was evident that the trial court was exercising its contempt power to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order. Therefore, this was a contempt order, and it was civil contempt. Thompson

                            Trial court did not err by denying defendants' motions for release from conditional incarceration for civil contempt because its unchallenged findings supported its conclusion that continuation of defendants' incarceration under the contempt order was
                            not punitive; because the relief was imprisonment, and defendants could be released by performing affirmative acts required by the trial court, it was coercive and thus, civil. Adams Creek Assocs. v. Davis,

                            Criminal and Civil Contempt Distinguished. - The line of demarcation between civil and criminal contempts is hazy at best. A major factor in determining whether a contempt is civil or criminal is the purpose for which the power is exercised. Where the
                            primary purpose is to preserve the court's authority and to punish for disobedience of its orders, the contempt is criminal. Where the primary purpose is to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with
                            an order, the contempt is civil. Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 503</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 867 (1969); O'Briant v. O'Briant, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 432</cite>,

                            Criminal contempt is a term applied where the judgment is in punishment of an act already accomplished, tending to interfere with the administration of justice. Civil contempt is a term applied where the proceeding is had to preserve and enforce the rights
                            of private parties to suits and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of such parties. Mauney v. Mauney, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 254</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 391 (1966).

                            Proceedings instituted to vindicate the dignity of the court and to punish attorney for his alleged interference with a custody order, although arising in a civil case, are criminal in nature. Patterson v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite>                            454, 289 S.E.2d 48 (1982).

                            In a quiet title action wherein defendants were found in civil contempt for failing to comply with the trial court's 2004 order not to trespass any longer, and were found in criminal contempt for their testimony threatening to disobey future orders of
                            the court, the defendants were found in civil and criminal contempt on the basis of different acts and, therefore, they were found in civil and criminal contempt for the same behavior in violation of G.S. 5A-21 and G.S. 5A-23.

                            Treatment of Civil Contempt. - Where the court finds that a defendant is in civil contempt, it is not limited by G.S. 5A-12 to imposing a 30-day sentence for criminal contempt. Under subsection (b) of this section, it can order his imprisonment until
                            he purges himself of contempt. Bennett v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 322 S.E.2d 439 (1984).

                            Punishment for Both Criminal and Civil Contempt. - As recognized in G.S. 5A-12(d) and subsection (c) of this section, a person may be found to be in both criminal and civil contempt, although only a single act was committed. Lowder v. All Star Mills,
                            Inc., <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 263 S.E.2d 624 (1980), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 561</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 247 (1981).

                            There are certain instances where contemners may be punished for both criminal contempt and for civil contempt. Blue Jeans Corp. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 166 S.E.2d 698,

                        <p>
                            One act may be punishable as both civil contempt and criminal contempt. This kind of duality particularly inheres in a party litigant's willful failure to comply with a discovery order. Willis v. Duke Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 19</cite>,

                            Disobedience Must Be Willful. - A failure to obey an order of a court cannot be punished by contempt proceedings unless the disobedience is willful, which imports knowledge and a stubborn resistance. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite>                            476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                            The element of willfulness is required for a finding of civil contempt under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.4ol1f9" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.4(f)(9)</a></cite> and this section. Jones

                            While a strict reading of this section does not require that a defendant's conduct be willful in order for him/her to be found in civil contempt, the courts have interpreted the statute to require an element of willfulness. Ross v. Voiers,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 490 S.E.2d 244 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 402</cite>, 496 S.E.2d 387 (1997).

                            Although the statutes governing civil contempt do not expressly require willful conduct, case law has interpreted the statutes to require an element of willfulness. Sharpe v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite>                            705, 493 S.E.2d 288 (1997).

                        <p>
                            Father was properly held in contempt for not paying child support where (1) he was properly subject to an order increasing his child support obligation as of the date of the mother's filing of a divorce complaint, (2) the purpose of the order could be
                            served by his compliance, and (3) his noncompliance with the order was willful in that he had made no payment toward the increase in his obligation from the date of the complaint to the date of trial, despite his ability to
                            comply with the court's order, and he presented no evidence as to why he should not be held in contempt. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 40, 568 S.E.2d 914 (2002).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was ambiguous whether the language of the order proscribed plaintiff's conduct, and thus it could not be said that her actions were willful and it was error for the trial court to have found plaintiff in contempt. Williams v. Chaney,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 792 S.E.2d 207 (2016).

                        <p>
                            Defendant was not improperly found in civil and criminal contempt for the same acts because defendant was found in civil contempt for continued conduct and in criminal contempt for past conduct. State v. Revels, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite>                            754, 793 S.E.2d 744 (2016).

                            Thus, Defendant Must Possess Means to Comply. - To support a finding of willfulness in failing to comply with a support order, there must be evidence to establish as an affirmative fact that defendant possessed the means to comply with the order at some
                            time after the entry of the order. Teachey v. Teachey, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 332, 264 S.E.2d 786 (1980).

                        <p>
                            For civil contempt to be applicable, the defendant must have the present ability to comply, or the present ability to take reasonable measures that would enable him to comply, with the order. Teachey v. Teachey, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite>                            332, 264 S.E.2d 786 (1980); Hodges v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C.

                        <p>
                            In order to punish by contempt proceedings, the trial court must find as a fact that the defendant possessed the means to comply with orders of the court during the period when he was in default. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite>                            136, 174 S.E.2d 2 (1970); Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Civil contempt is based upon acts or neglect constituting a willful violation of a lawful order of the court. A failure to obey an order of the court cannot be punished by attachment for civil contempt unless the disobedience is willful. It is well settled
                            that one does not act willfully in failing to comply with a judgment if it has not been within his power to do so since the judgment was rendered. Henderson v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 401</cite>,

                            This section and G.S. 5A-22 must be construed in pari materia. When so construed, these statutes require that a person have the present ability to comply with the conditions for purging the contempt before that person may be imprisoned for civil contempt.

                            The purpose of civil contempt is to coerce compliance with a court order; therefore, present ability or means to satisfy that order is essential. Adkins v. Adkins, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 289, 346 S.E.2d 220

                            Court Must Determine Defendant's Ability to Comply. - A defendant in a civil contempt action will be fined or incarcerated only after a determination is made that the defendant is capable of complying with the order of the court. Reece v. Reece,

                            Order holding a husband in civil contempt for not paying previously ordered obligations was vacated because only the husband's partial ability to comply was found, yet the husband was ordered to comply in full and pay more. Spears v. Spears,

                            When determining business owners' ability to comply with an order in proceedings on whether the owners should be held in contempt, it was not improper to consider the owners' jointly-held bank accounts and individually-held investment retirement accounts
                            because such assets were relevant to the owners' ability to comply. Plasman v. Decca Furniture (USA), Inc., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 800 S.E.2d 761 (2017), cert. denied, 812

                            Trial court's finding that a debtor was in civil contempt for failing to comply with a consent judgment for the payment of a debt was proper pursuant to G.S 5A-21(a); the finding was based on evidence establishing as an affirmative fact that the debtor
                            possessed the current ability to comply with the order. GMAC v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 573 S.E.2d 226 (2002).

                            Findings Inadequate to Support Contempt. - A trial court's findings that a defendant was healthy and able-bodied, had been and was presently employed, had not been in ill health or incapacitated, and had the ability to earn good wages, without finding
                            that defendant presently had the means to comply, did not support confinement in jail for contempt. Hodges v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 307 S.E.2d 575 (1983).

                            Trial court erred in holding a husband in contempt for his failure to pay alimony where there was no determination in the trial court's findings of the husband's present ability to comply with the terms of the alimony order. Oakley v. Oakley,

                            It was error to hold defendants in a summary ejectment proceeding in civil contempt. The trial court had not made appropriate findings of fact to support the entry of a civil contempt order, as required by G.S. 5A-23(e), and it had not found that defendants
                            had the ability to comply with the order, as required by G.S. 5A-21(2a)-(3); indeed, it had found that defendants were not able to pay the order. Carter v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite>                            464, 650 S.E.2d 843 (2007).

                            Business owners' willful disobedience of a court order enforcing an injunction was properly found because the owners (1) failed to comply with the order, (2) continually sought clarification of the terms of an order that were clear, and (3) refused to
                            accept the trial court's finding that the trial court had jurisdiction despite the owners' appeal. Plasman v. Decca Furniture (USA), Inc., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 800 S.E.2d

                            Since defendants were already serving an indefinite, conditional prison sentence for civil contempt at the time their motions for release from conditional incarceration were filed, the trial court was not adjudicating an initial or continuing contempt
                            and thus, had no inherent statutory obligation to consider any of subsection (a)'s enumerations; rather, the issue for the trial court was whether defendants satisfied their burden of showing they were subject to release. Adams

                            Trial court did not err in refusing to make findings on defendants' inability to comply with a contempt order because based on their refusals to perform the attestation purge act, and their admissions that they would refuse to perform the purge act, they
                            vitiated their inability defense; since the purge condition acts did not require defendants to pay a monetary judgment, they could be imprisoned without further hearing, and the hearing was not an initial or continuing adjudication
                            of contempt. Adams Creek Assocs. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 391, 810 S.E.2d 6 (2018).

                            Trial court did not err by failing to find that the purpose of the civil contempt order and prior orders served by defendants' continued incarceration because defendants had not removed their structures from plaintiff's property, and thus, the purpose
                            of the summary judgment order could still be served by compliance; because the hearing was not an initial or continuing contempt adjudication, the trial court was under no statutory obligation to reconsider. Adams Creek Assocs.

                            Findings Sufficient for Contempt Holding. - Finding that a husband was in contempt for failure to pay child support was proper because the trial court's finding that the husband's failure to comply with the order was willful and that he had the ability
                            to comply or take reasonable efforts to do so was minimally sufficient for purposes of G.S. 5A-21; although the husband was gainfully employed at the time the orders were entered, shortly afterward, he joined a religious community
                            which prohibited its members from earning outside income and claimed that he therefore did not have the ability to pay the order. That the husband's religious beliefs may have been sincerely-held was irrelevant. Shippen v.

                            Trial court did not err by holding a former spouse in civil contempt for the spouse's failure to make the monthly distributive payments required by the equitable distribution order because the evidence supported the court's finding that the spouse had
                            the present ability to pay the distributive award and that the spouse's failure to comply with the order was willful. Lesh v. Lesh, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 809 S.E.2d 890

                            Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Insufficient. - Findings of fact and conclusion of law in a civil contempt order were insufficient. The trial court had failed to make findings regarding G.S. 5A-21(a)(1) and (2); there were no findings regarding
                            defendant's present ability to pay postseparation support; and the statement that the support order was interlocutory was not a conclusion of law. Thompson v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite>                            515, 735 S.E.2d 214 (2012).

                            the amended custody order and returning the children to the father; thus, there was no longer any purpose to be served by holding the mother in civil contempt, and the trial court's conclusion was improper as a matter of law.

                            Trial court was without authority to award attorney fees to an individual because there was no statutory authority allowing the trial court to impose attorney fees as a sanction for the failure of business parties to comply with an order of the trial

                            There was no legal basis for an award of attorney's fees to a mother because even if a father's exercise of a third week of visitation had violated the consent order, that week was the sole alleged violation of the consent order, and it occurred before

                            Child Support Orders. - Willful failure and refusal of a party to make payments for the support of his child in accordance with decree of court is civil contempt, and the court may order him into custody until he shows compliance or is otherwise discharged
                            according to law. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 298</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 400 (1958).

                        <p>
                            Civil contempt proceedings are a proper method of enforcing orders for payment of child support. The purpose of civil contempt in such a case is not to punish but to coerce a defendant into compliance with the support order. McMiller v. McMiller,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 808, 336 S.E.2d 134 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Father was properly held in contempt where he unilaterally reduced his child support payments after suffering a substantial reduction in income. Chused v. Chused, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 508 S.E.2d 559

                        <p>
                            Former wife was not in contempt, although she divided her child support in half when one of the parties' two children came to live with her, and shortly thereafter moved the court for a reduction in child support, thereby indicating that the reduction
                            was not a deliberate or intentional attempt to violate the court's support order. Spencer v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 38, 514 S.E.2d 283 (1999).

                            Husband was found to be in contempt of order requiring him to pay $5,000 to his wife as a lump sum property settlement and to provide health insurance for their minor children: the husband was aware of his obligation to pay the property settlement, but
                            admittedly failed to pay because he paid higher taxes due to the wife's failure to jointly file tax returns with him; in addition, there was no evidence to support the husband's contention that the wife agreed to modify that
                            portion of the original order requiring the husband to provide health insurance for the children. Meehan v. Lawrance, <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 602 S.E.2d 21 (2004).

                            Trial court's order of specific performance, which required business parties to comply with the terms of a court approved settlement agreement with an individual, was enforceable through the contempt powers of the court. Baxley v. Jackson,

                            Under G.S. 5A-21(a)(2a), a former wife was in civil contempt because she used monies in a fund, which was created to satisfy her former husband's child support obligations and to pay for medical expenses for the parties' children, for purposes other than
                            those established by court orders, the wife's improper use of the monies was willful, and the wife failed to provide a full accounting of her use of the monies in the fund. Eakes v. Eakes,

                            Trial court, in entering a civil commitment order for defendant's failure to pay child support, erred in finding that defendant had ability to comply with the child support order and that defendant's noncompliance with the order was willful because defendant
                            was at all relevant times physically incapable of employment as defendant had little education, treating physicians testified that defendant was physically incapable of gainful employment, defendant had no income and lived
                            with defendant's parents, and defendant was unable to find work. Cty. of Durham v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 288, 809 S.E.2d 317 (2018).

                            Orders finding a father in contempt for a failure to pay child support were vacated because (1) an agency presented no evidence other than the amount of child support arrears or past public assistance owed, while the father presented substantial evidence
                            of an inability to pay, including the father's medical condition and minimal living expenses and lack of income, (2) the orders' findings did not support a conclusion that the father willfully refused to pay or had the ability
                            to pay civil contempt purge payments, (3) nothing showed the father was working at the time of trial, nor was this found, and (4) the trial court did not address how much, if any, regular income the father had or the father's
                            subsistence living expenses. Cty. of Durham ex rel. Wilson v. Burnette, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 17, 821 S.E.2d 840 (2018), aff'd, 824 S.E.2d 397, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 209 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Although defendant's child support obligation terminated because her son turned 18 and was no longer in school, the arrears owed to the county remained in force, as defendant made no child support payments before her son turned 18 and the court found
                            the purpose of the order would be served by her compliance; her challenge to be held in civil contempt failed. Cumberland Cty. ex rel. Mitchell v. Manning, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite>                            383, 822 S.E.2d 305 (2018).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in not holding the father in contempt as he did not intend to willfully violate the child support order because he was under the mistaken apprehension that he could simply stop paying after his son ceased living with the mother.
                            Morris v. Powell, - N.C. App. - , 840 S.E.2d 223 (2020).

                            Visitation Orders. - Where mother encouraged child to go with his father for scheduled visitations, and the child refused, the evidence was insufficient to find that the mother acted purposefully and deliberately or with knowledge and stubborn resistance
                            to prevent the father's visitation with the child, so as to subject her to civil contempt; the mother was not required to physically force the child to go. Hancock v. Hancock, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite>                            518, 471 S.E.2d 415 (1996).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly found a mother to be in civil contempt of court pursuant to G.S. 5A-21(a); the mother knew of the existence of an order granting the child's grandparents visitation, but refused to send the child for visitation and took the child
                            to Hawaii for the summer to prevent the visitation in a willful manner. Young v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 31, 609 S.E.2d 795 (2005).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly concluded that a father was in willful contempt of prior custody orders regarding the exchange time for weekend visitations because the father's habitual lateness did not result from unforeseen circumstances; the evidence supported
                            the finding that although the father and the mother agreed he would leave a party at 8:30 p.m. to meet for the exchange, the father refused to leave at the agreed upon time and, as a result, the exchange did not occur. Wilson
                            v. Guinyard, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 229, 801 S.E.2d 700 (2017).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because a consent order was ambiguous, and a father acted in accordance with his reasonable interpretation of the consent order, the father did not willfully violate its terms, and the trial court erred by holding him in civil contempt; the father's interpretation
                            of the consent order was at least as reasonable as the mother's interpretation, and the mother presented no parol evidence to support her interpretation beyond the four corners of the document. Walter v. Walter, - N.C. App.
                            - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 17, 2021).

                        <p>
                            Payment of Educational Expenses. - Where defendant refused to pay educational expenses as provided in consent judgment, there was competent evidence to support the court's findings and conclusion that the defendant was in contempt of the consent judgment
                            pursuant to subsection (a). Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 465 S.E.2d 52 (1996).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly found father in civil contempt where he willfully failed to pay his daughters college expenses as he had contracted to do. Ross v. Voiers, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 490 S.E.2d 244
                            (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 402</cite>, 496 S.E.2d 387 (1997).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because there was competent evidence to support the trial court's findings that the child diligently applied herself to her college studies, that the father was able to pay for her college expenses, and that his nonpayment was willful, the trial court
                            did not err in holding the father in civil contempt for violating the stipulations and order requiring him to pay 90% of the child's college expenses and ordering him to pay $15,150. Barker v. Barker,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 745 S.E.2d 910 (2013).

                        <p>
                            Imprisonment for Nonsupport. - A defendant in a nonsupport civil contempt proceeding can be imprisoned only if he has willfully violated the court order and has the present ability to make the payments. He can regain his liberty by doing that which the
                            court has ordered him to do and he has the ability to do, i.e., make the payments. This is consistent with the notion that civil contempt is not criminal punishment, but a civil remedy to be utilized exclusively to enforce
                            compliance with court orders. Hodges v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 307 S.E.2d 575 (1983).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before a previous order of child support can be enforced by civil imprisonment which can be avoided by paying money, it must first appear that the defendant is capable of making the payments required. State v. Miller,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 436, 335 S.E.2d 187 (1985).

                            Failure to Pay Child Support Where Unable to Do So. - A defendant who has not made child support payments because he is actually unable to make the payments does not face a loss of liberty. Hodges v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite>                            550, 307 S.E.2d 575 (1983); Graham v. Graham, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C.

                        <p>
                            Although an order for child support is enforceable by civil contempt proceedings, a supporting party cannot be held in contempt unless such party has willfully failed to comply with the support order. A finding of willful failure to comply with the order
                            requires evidence of the present ability to pay or to take reasonable measures to comply. Brower v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 331 S.E.2d 170 (1985).

                            Consent Judgment in Domestic Relations Setting. - In a domestic relations setting, a consent judgment which has been adopted by the court, but which contains unequivocal language to the effect that it is not subject to modification, may nevertheless be
                            enforced by civil contempt. Henderson v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 286 S.E.2d 657 (1982), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 401</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 345 (1983).

                            Civil contempt proceedings to enforce orders for payment of support to children pursuant to consent judgment are authorized by this section. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 298</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 400 (1958).

                        <p>
                            Alimony. - A judgment ordering the payment of alimony may be enforced by the contempt power. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 174 S.E.2d 2 (1970).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the trial judge found that individual was a healthy and able-bodied man for his age, and further found that he could pay at least a portion of the alimony, it was error to imprison him until he should pay the whole amount. Cox v. Cox,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 179 S.E.2d 194 (1971).

                        <p>
                            A breach of contract is not punishable as civil contempt. Luther v. Luther, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 429</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 345 (1951); In re Will of Smith, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 563</cite>, 107 S.E.2d 89 (1959).

                        <p>
                            Where proceeding for civil contempt is set in motion to compel a person to substitute a binding agreement for an invalid one, an order penalizing the plaintiff runs counter to the sound rule that the court will not entertain contempt proceedings where
                            the mover's purpose is to coerce his adversary into making a contract. Luther v. Luther, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 429</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 345 (1951).

                            Refusal to effectuate an agreement to sign a consent judgment may not be made the basis for contempt proceedings where it does not appear that the parties ever agreed to the exact terms of such judgment. State v. Clark,

                            Failure to Comply with Discovery Order. - Where defendant was accused of mismanaging, diverting and wasting corporate assets, and the trial court ordered him to cooperate with receivers of the corporation and to provide them and plaintiffs with copies
                            of his tax returns and a list of his assets, defendant's contempt, if any, in failing to provide the required materials could be criminal or civil, and contemnor waived procedural requirements when he came into court to answer
                            charges of the trial court's show cause order. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 561</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 247 (1981).

                            Refusal of municipal officers to surrender their offices in accordance with the results of an election held pursuant to the provisions of a decree of court cannot be made the basis for contempt proceedings, since upon the hearing of the order to show
                            cause the court must first adjudicate the rights of the parties to the offices, and such adjudication can be made only in a direct proceeding for that purpose. Corey v. Hardison, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 147</cite>,

                            Order to Produce Tax Returns. - Where defendant was accused of mismanaging, diverting, converting and wasting corporate assets, and he was ordered by the trial court to produce his tax returns, the production of the returns did not amount to such authentication
                            as to be compelled testimonial self-incrimination which would support a claim of Fifth Amendment privilege; thus, defendant could be found in contempt. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 561</cite>,

                            Where defendant was accused of mismanaging, diverting, converting and wasting corporate assets, defendant's refusal to comply with the trial court's order to produce tax returns was not protected by the Fifth Amendment proscription against compulsory
                            self-incrimination, and thus he could be found in contempt, since there was no evidence tending to show that defendant was under any physical or mental coercion at the time he prepared his tax returns, and he therefore could
                            not rely upon the contents of the tax returns to support his claim of Fifth Amendment protection. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 561</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 247 (1981).

                            Order to Appear as Attorney. - An out-of-state attorney could not be held in and punished for willful contempt of court for failure to comply with an order of the trial court that he appear as an attorney in a criminal case where there had been no general
                            appearance by local counsel as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.084.html#t84a01s84-4.1" target="_blank">G.S. 84-4.1</a></cite> and the out-of-state attorney thus never acquired
                            eligibility to appear in the case and was never an attorney in the case admitted to limited practice in North Carolina. In re Smith, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 621</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 834 (1981).

                            Order Allowing Defendant to Avoid Confinement by Paying Arrearages Held Remedial Relief. - Where the court ordered defendant confined in jail for a period of 29 days, but it allowed defendant to avoid that punishment altogether by paying the entire amount
                            of child support arrearages, this constituted remedial relief and therefore required that the court's order be construed as adjudicating defendant in civil contempt.

                            Continual Violation of Sexual Exhibition/Adult Business Ordinance. - Competent evidence supported the trial court's decision to hold plaintiff owner of adult business in contempt, and the plaintiff, by her refusal to present testimony and invoking her
                            Fifth Amendment Right, chose to abandon her claim that she was not in contempt of the trial court's order. McKillop v. Onslow County, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 532 S.E.2d 594

                            No-Contact Order. - Proceedings to hold a contemnor in contempt for violating a no-contact order were in civil contempt because (1) the proceedings were initiated pursuant to civil contempt statutes, (2) the order finding the contemnor in contempt included
                            civil contempt findings and a "purge" clause, and (3) construing the order as a civil contempt order was consistent with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050C.html#t50Cs50C-10" target="_blank">G.S. 50C-10</a></cite>                            and G.S. 5A-25's default civil contempt rule.

                            When a contemnor was found in contempt for violating a no-contact order, a fine was an authorized sanction because, reading G.S. 5A-21, 50C-10, 5A-25, and 50C-5 together, the statutes supported the inference that fines were authorized. Tyll v. Berry,
                            <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 758 S.E.2d 411 (2014).

                            Oral Order Was Not Judgment For Civil Contempt Purposes. - When the trial court orally ordered defendants in a summary ejectment proceeding to pay a certain amount but did not reduce a judgment to writing as required by N.C. R. Civ. P. 58, it was error
                            to hold defendants in civil contempt under G.S. 5A-21, as there was no properly entered judgment of the trial court at the time defendants were found in civil contempt.

                            Payment of Counsel Fees as Condition to Being Purged of Contempt. - The contempt power includes the authority for a district court judge to require one whom he has found in willful contempt of court for failure to comply with a child support order entered
                            pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-13.1" target="_blank">G.S. 50-13.1</a></cite>, et seq., to pay reasonable counsel fees to opposing counsel as a condition
                            to being purged of contempt. Blair v. Blair, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 173 S.E.2d 513 (1970).

                            Effect of Payment of Fine. - A party to a proceeding as for contempt undoubtedly waives his right to have the judgment in the proceeding reviewed on appeal by voluntarily paying the fine imposed upon him by the judgment. But where the record reveals that
                            the fine was paid under protest at the precise moment an appeal was noted from the order imposing it, and that the party took this course to avoid being committed to jail until the fine was paid, inasmuch as the payment was
                            the product of coercion, the right of appeal was not waived by making it. Luther v. Luther, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 429</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 345 (1951).

                            Payment of Child Support. - Husband could not be found in civil contempt under G.S. 5A-21(b), for his failure to pay child support, where he paid the past due support prior to the contempt hearing, even though it was paid after he was served with the
                            show cause contempt motion. Reynolds v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 557 S.E.2d 126 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 493</cite>, 563 S.E.2d 567 (2002).

                            Alimony Arrears. - Trial court did not err in requiring defendant to pay $10,000 towards alimony arrears as a purge payment for civil contempt of court because the uncontested facts supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant had the present
                            means and ability to comply with the order or was able to take reasonable measures that would enable him to comply with the order by paying $10,000; the trial court properly considered the assets defendant had available at
                            the time of the contempt hearing to satisfy the $10,000 payment towards the alimony arrears and specifically based its conclusion regarding his ability to pay upon the fact that he had available $6,200 from his 401K account,
                            a $2,000 cashier's check, and assets that could be readily converted to cash. Tucker v. Tucker, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 592, 679 S.E.2d 141 (2009).

                            issue of civil contempt because civil contempt is a completely discretionary sanction, thus, even if the Commission made explicit findings that all of the conditions outlined in G.S. 5A-21(a) were satisfied, it still would

                            contempt. Bishop v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 369 S.E.2d 106 (1988).

                            Inability to Take Reasonable Measures. - Husband could not take reasonable measures to comply with a court order because (1) the husband could not force the husband's second wife to sell a house the husband owned with the second wife as tenants by the
                            entirety, and (2) any reduction in the husband's withholding from the husband's gross income for taxes still would not have enabled the husband to comply. Spears v. Spears, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite>                            260, 784 S.E.2d 485 (2016).

                            No Evidence of Ability to Pay. - Record was devoid of evidence of defendant's ability to pay the child support amount or purge amount at the time of the hearing; while the record included her 2016 affidavit of indigency, it was not evidence of her present
                            ability to pay at the time of the hearing. Cumberland Cty. ex rel. Mitchell v. Manning, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 383, 822 S.E.2d 305 (2018).

                            Distributive Awards. - Trial court ordered plaintiff to liquidate certain real properties to pay down the distributive award; because this unquestionably disturbed plaintiff's rights in her separate property, the trial court's actions amounted to an impermissible
                            distribution of that property, but this finding was not intended to limit the trial court's civil contempt power should she fail to comply with the order, at which time all of her assets could be taken into account. Crowell

                            Incorrect standard in ruling on show cause order. - Trial court's conclusion, in ruling on a motion to show cause for failure to comply with the court's previous orders, that no showing had been made under G.S. 5A-21 was error, as the trial court was
                            only required to determine, pursuant to G.S. 5A-23(a), whether the information contained in the motion and the record was sufficient to warrant a prudent person to believe the contemnor had the ability to comply with the trial
                            court's order; since the trial court used the incorrect standard in denying the motion, remand was required. Young v. Mastrom, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 560 S.E.2d 596

                            Interference with Order Awarding Child Custody - Trial court erred by holding a husband in contempt for violating the court's order awarding custody of the husband's children to his ex-wife where the husband followed his ex-wife as she was leaving a ball
                            game and argued with her in front of their children. Scott v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 579 S.E.2d 431 (2003).

                            No Finding of Contempt as Actions in Violation of Visitation Order Were Justified. - Trial court's finding that the mother's actions, suspending the father's visitation over his objection and without court authority, did not amount to contempt was upheld,
                            as there was evidence that the mother's failure to comply with the visitation order was justified after the father physically discipline a child in an inappropriate way, the children were visibly shaken and upset by the incident,
                            and there had been past allegations of domestic violence involving the father. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 494, 748 S.E.2d 594 (2013).

                            Contempt Upheld. - Trial court did not err by holding the husband in contempt of prior orders for child support and alimony while also setting his arrears owed based on the modified alimony obligation because the prior order remained in force for the
                            child support obligation and for alimony up to the newly reduced amount. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 821 S.E.2d 210 (2018).

                            Evidence Sufficient to Support Finding of Contempt. - When parties' consent order provided that a wife was to assume financial responsibility for credit card debt, and the wife had the present means and ability to comply, it was not error for the trial
                            court to hold defendant in contempt of court pursuant to G.S. 5A-23(a)(1) for failing to comply with the consent order as it related to the credit card accounts, and to order the wife to pay off the debt as a condition of purging
                            herself of contempt as required by G.S. 5A-21(a)(2). When the wife refused to execute forms requested by the Internal Revenue Service in order to file amended tax returns, as required under the parties' consent order, it was
                            not error for the court to order defendant to sign these form. Watson v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 652 S.E.2d 310 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 373</cite>,

                            Sufficient evidence supported a trial court's finding a former wife in civil contempt for willful failure to comply with a consent order for equitable distribution, G.S. 5A-21(a), because the wife failed to remove the former husband's name from a vehicle's
                            title, per the consent order, the vehicle was repossessed while in the wife's possession and sold with a resulting deficiency on the account, the wife had the ability to comply with the consent order, and the wife had the ability
                            to pay the deficiency but willfully failed to pay the deficiency. Moss v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. App.</cite> 75, 730 S.E.2d 203 (2012).

                            When a consent order directed a father to make child support payments but the father failed to comply with the order, the evidence supported the trial court's decision to find the father in civil contempt because the father had maintained employment from
                            the date the consent order was executed and had the means to comply with the order. Maxwell v. Maxwell, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 614, 713 S.E.2d 489 (2011).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly held a former husband in contempt under G.S. 5A-21(a) for his failure to comply with provisions of prior court orders, which ordered him to make mortgage payments, as he had agreed to do in the parties' separation agreement; the trial
                            court's findings provided a sufficient factual basis to support the contempt determination. Young v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 736 S.E.2d 538 (2012).

                        <p>
                            District court did not err in finding the husband in civil contempt and ordering him jailed unless he paid $20,000 to his former wife within 60 days where the extensive evidence and findings as to his income and expenses showed that the trial court had
                            considered his ability to comply as of the date of the hearing. Gordon v. Gordon, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 757 S.E.2d 351 (2014).

                        <p>
                            Findings that the father had a monthly income of $47,000, purchased a residence worth approximately $840,000, owned over $140,000 worth of stocks, bonds, and securities, and had retirements accounts worth more than $900,000, supported the conclusion that
                            the father had ample income and assets to pay the children's private school tuition and willfully failed to comply. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 785 S.E.2d 434

                            District court erred in holding a father in civil contempt for failure to pay child support arrearages because, while the father failed to meet his burden of proof to show cause, the child support agency put forth no evidence to support the finding of
                            fact that the father had the ability to comply with the previous order and had the ability to purge himself as ordered. Cumberland County ex rel. Ala. O. B. O v.

                            Evidence Sufficient to Reject Finding of Contempt. - Trial court did not err in denying a wife's motion for contempt where the husband had made a $50,000 payment, albeit under protest, under one of the options in a consent order, and thus, he had complied
                            with the consent order prior to the contempt hearing. Gandhi v. Gandhi, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 779 S.E.2d 185 (2015).

                            Insufficient Findings. - In the trial court's order failing to hold the father in civil contempt over the parties' visitation agreement, the court held that the trial court properly considered the 15-year-old daughter's best interests and the current
                            circumstances in evaluating whether the father was in willful civil contempt for not forcing her to visit the mother. The record showed that the daughter was depressed and self-harming, both she and her older brother refused
                            to return to the mother's home, and the daughter testified that she was more depressed and anxious at the mother's home. Grissom v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 821 S.E.2d

                            Order declining to hold a father in contempt for failure to pay child support was vacated and remanded for further findings because, while it was the father's burden to show why the father should not be held in contempt, the could only be so found if
                            sufficient evidence supported each statutory element, and (1) the trial court did not find if the father complied with the most recent order, if the father's compliance could still serve the order's purpose, if any noncompliance
                            were willful, or if the father could comply or take reasonable measures to do so, (2) such findings could not be inferred from the trial court's order, and (3) a mother did not provide a complete record of relevant pleadings
                            or a full transcript of the proceedings before the trial court. Servatius v. Ryals, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 213, 823 S.E.2d 129 (2018).

                            Penalty for Direct and Indirect Contempt the Same; Thus, No Reversible Error. - In a quiet title action wherein the defendants testified in the trial court's presence, which constituted direct criminal contempt, but the trial court mistakenly held them
                            in indirect criminal contempt, such error was not grounds for reversal as the penalty was the same for both direct and indirect criminal contempt. Adams Creek Assocs. v.

                    <p>
                        Subsection (a) permits the one who has custody of a jailed contemnor to release him without a court order or any formal proceedings, if the custodian finds that the contemnor has purged himself of the contempt by complying with the contempt order's specifications.
                        This is intended to apply mainly to the situation in which compliance with the order calls for payment to the court. It was felt that this action was so clear that the custodian should be able to proceed on his own. The possibility
                        that a person will be released when a release was not proper was outweighed by the importance of seeing to it that a person did not remain jailed longer than was necessary. Subsection (b) establishes the machinery for a civil contemnor
                        to seek his own release if he has complied or if compliance is no longer possible, but he has still not been released.

                        The purpose of civil contempt is not to punish but to coerce the defendant to comply with a court order. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 515 S.E.2d 61 (1999).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Civil contempt is employed to coerce disobedient defendants into complying with orders of court, and the length of time that a defendant can be imprisoned in a proper case is not limited by law, since the defendant can obtain his release immediately upon
                        complying with the court's order. Brower v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 131, 318 S.E.2d 542 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err by denying defendants' motions for release from conditional incarceration for civil contempt because its unchallenged findings supported its conclusion that continuation of defendants' incarceration under the contempt order was
                        not punitive; because the relief was imprisonment, and defendants could be released by performing affirmative acts required by the trial court, it was coercive and thus, civil. Adams Creek Assocs. v. Davis,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 391, 810 S.E.2d 6 (2018).

                        Defendant Must Have Present Ability to Comply. - This section and G.S. 5A-21 must be construed in pari materia. When so construed, these statutes require that a person have the present ability to comply with the conditions for purging the contempt before
                        that person may be imprisoned for civil contempt. McMiller v. McMiller, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 808, 336 S.E.2d 134 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Purging Provision. - The contempt order must be vacated if it fails to specify, as required by subsection (a) of this section, how the defendant might purge herself of contempt. The purpose of civil contempt is not to punish, but to coerce the defendant
                        to comply with the order. Thus the purging provision is essential to the order. Bethea v. McDonald, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 320 S.E.2d 690 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in requiring defendant to pay $10,000 towards alimony arrears as a purge payment for civil contempt of court because the uncontested facts supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant had the present means and ability
                        to comply with the order or was able to take reasonable measures that would enable him to comply with the order by paying $10,000; the trial court properly considered the assets defendant had available at the time of the contempt
                        hearing to satisfy the $10,000 payment towards the alimony arrears and specifically based its conclusion regarding his ability to pay upon the fact that he had available $6,200 from his 401K account, a $2,000 cashier's check, and
                        assets that could be readily converted to cash. Tucker v. Tucker, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 592, 679 S.E.2d 141 (2009).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not improperly modify custody or impose improper purge conditions because its contempt order identified what a father could and could not do regarding visitation times in order to purge himself of the civil contempt and insure his compliance
                        with the previous court orders regarding the exchange time for weekend visitations; permanent joint legal custody and secondary physical custody remained with the father both before and after the contempt order. Wilson v. Guinyard,
                        <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 229, 801 S.E.2d 700 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in refusing to make findings on defendants' inability to comply with a contempt order because based on their refusals to perform the attestation purge act, and their admissions that they would refuse to perform the purge act, they
                        vitiated their inability defense; since the purge condition acts did not require defendants to pay a monetary judgment, they could be imprisoned without further hearing, and the hearing was not an initial or continuing adjudication
                        of contempt. Adams Creek Assocs. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 391, 810 S.E.2d 6 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Means for Purging Contempt Required. - Trial court had the authority to enforce consent order regarding repairs to a dwelling through its contempt powers, but the trial court erred by failing to provide for a means for defendant to purge himself of the
                        contempt. Nohejl v. First Homes of Craven County, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 188, 461 S.E.2d 10 (1995).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in holding the father in civil contempt because the trial court did not clearly specify what the father could and could not do to purge himself of contempt. Wellons v. White, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite>                        164, 748 S.E.2d 709 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Sufficient Notice of Civil Contempt Proceedings. - When a former wife was held in civil contempt of court pursuant to G.S. 5A-23(a)(1) for failing to comply with an equitable distribution consent order, the constitutional notice requirements applicable
                        to criminal contempt proceedings were not implicated, and the wife received adequate notice of the nature of the contempt proceedings when the wife was served with a copy of the motion for an order to show cause, which stated the
                        grounds for the alleged civil contempt as required by G.S. 5A-21(a)(2) and 5A-22, as well as the show cause order referencing the motion. Watson v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 55,
                        652 S.E.2d 310 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 373</cite>, 662 S.E.2d 551 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Purge Provision Impermissibly Vague. - A condition of a temporary child custody order was impermissibly vague, where a condition to be met for the mother to purge herself of civil contempt was that she not punish either of the minor children in any manner
                        that was "stressful, abusive, or detrimental" to the child. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 515 S.E.2d 61 (1999).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Order finding a husband's non-compliance with purge conditions was vacated because (1) the husband could not comply with the conditions in a written order, (2) the order was impermissibly vague as the order's conditions had no end date, and, (3) despite
                        the husband's compliance with a condition to reduce tax withholding, a condition requiring the husband to consult with a tax professional to reduce withholdings to the maximum extent possible was wrongly added. Spears v. Spears,
                        <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 784 S.E.2d 485 (2016).

                        Trial Court Without Authority to Require Contemnor to Pay Compensatory Damages. - Upon a finding of contempt, in situations where the original order requires a transfer of property (including intangible property such as that represented by stock certificates),
                        the trial court has authority to order the contemnor to transfer said property as a condition of purging the contempt, but does not have authority to require the contemnor to pay compensatory damages incurred as a result of his
                        noncompliance with the original order. Hartsell v. Hartsell, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 393 S.E.2d 570 (1990), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 729</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 307 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Subsection (a) draws a distinction between an order to appear for a show of cause hearing and a notice that the show-cause hearing will be held. The Commission wanted to make clear the propriety of a person's not appearing if he was notified of the show-cause
                        hearing rather than ordered to appear at it. Since the Commission felt that there were some instances in which the court would want the contemnor present regardless of his wishes, the order was left as an option. Application of
                        subsection (b) results in magistrates and clerks being unable to hold proceedings for civil contempt. The Commission particularly intended "a person with an interest" under subsection (f) to include the State, as represented by
                        the district attorney, in a criminal case. Subsection (g) permits, in essence, consolidated hearings for civil and criminal contempt, thus permitting a judge who has begun a civil contempt hearing to continue and find the person
                        in criminal contempt even though he is beyond the reach of civil contempt because of inability at that time to comply with the order.

                        Criminal and Civil Contempt Distinguished. - In a quiet title action wherein defendants were found in civil contempt for failing to comply with the trial court's 2004 order not to trespass any longer, and were found in criminal contempt for their testimony
                        threatening to disobey future orders of the court, the defendants were found in civil and criminal contempt on the basis of different acts and, therefore, they were found in civil and criminal contempt for the same behavior in
                        violation of G.S. 5A-21 and G.S. 5A-23. Adams Creek Assocs. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 512, 652 S.E.2d 677 (2007), review denied as to additional issues, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 354</cite>,

                        Defendant's Rights Under U.S. Const., Amend. V, Not Implicated in Civil Contempt Case. - Where trial court ordered defendant incarcerated, gave defendant the opportunity to purge his contempt by complying with prior consent order and paying certain sums
                        for attorney's fees and damages, and imposed no other penalty, the relief granted was wholly civil in nature. Since defendant was not, in fact, subject to criminal penalties, there was no necessity to examine whether defendant's
                        rights under U.S. Const., Amend. V were adequately protected during the contempt proceeding. Hartsell v. Hartsell, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 393 S.E.2d 570 (1990), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 729</cite>,

                        When a former wife was held in civil contempt of court pursuant to G.S. 5A-23(a)(1) for failing to comply with an equitable distribution consent order, the constitutional notice requirements applicable to criminal contempt proceedings were not implicated,
                        and the wife received adequate notice of the nature of the contempt proceedings when the wife was served with a copy of the motion for an order to show cause, which stated the grounds for the alleged civil contempt as required
                        by G.S. 5A-21(a)(2) and G.S. 5A-22, as well as the show cause order referencing the motion. Watson v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 652 S.E.2d 310 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 373</cite>,

                        Venue. - It was error to hold a husband in civil contempt because, (1) while venue was normally proper in the county in which the order allegedly violated was issued, the husband asserted the husband's statutory right to a change of venue, under
                        <cite

                        Contemnor Must Have Means to Comply Before Being Found in Contempt. - Contempt proceedings are not a form of punishment, but serve to ensure obedience to orders of the court. Therefore it is essential that the alleged contemnor have the means to comply,
                        and that the court so find, before she can be found in contempt. Glesner v. Dembrosky, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 327 S.E.2d 60 (1985).

                        On its face order demonstrated noncompliance with this section where the trial court first determined that plaintiff's failure to appear created the jeopardy of contempt, then it immediately found plaintiff to be in actual contempt. Garrett v. Garrett,

                        District court erred in holding a father in civil contempt for failure to pay child support arrearages because, while the father failed to meet his burden of proof to show cause, the child support agency put forth no evidence to support the finding of
                        fact that the father had the ability to comply with the previous order and had the ability to purge himself as ordered. Cumberland County ex rel. Ala. O. B. O v.

                        Findings Preferable But Not Essential in Proceeding to Enforce Support. - While explicit findings are always preferable in a civil contempt proceeding to enforce an order for child support, they are not absolutely essential where the findings otherwise
                        clearly indicate that a contempt order is warranted. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 327 S.E.2d 273 (1985).

                        Court Need Only Find Means to Comply and Refusal to Do So. - In civil contempt proceedings to enforce orders for child support, the court is required to find only that the allegedly delinquent obligor has the means to comply with the order and that he
                        or she willfully refused to do so. Plott v. Plott, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 327 S.E.2d 273 (1985).

                        Incorrect standard in ruling on show cause order. - Trial court's conclusion, in ruling on a motion to show cause for failure to comply with the court's previous orders, that no showing had been made under G.S. 5A-21 was error, as the trial court was
                        only required to determine, pursuant to G.S. 5A-23(a), whether the information contained in the motion and the record was sufficient to warrant a prudent person to believe the contemnor had the ability to comply with the trial
                        court's order; since the trial court used the incorrect standard in denying the motion, remand was required. Young v. Mastrom, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 560 S.E.2d 596 (2002).

                        It was error to hold defendants in a summary ejectment proceeding in civil contempt. The trial court had not made appropriate findings of fact to support the entry of a civil contempt order, as required by G.S. 5A-23(e), and it had not found that defendants
                        had the ability to comply with the order, as required by G.S. 5A-21(2a)-(3); indeed, it had found that defendants were not able to pay the order. Carter v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite>                        464, 650 S.E.2d 843 (2007).

                        Remand for Further Findings Required. - Order declining to hold a father in contempt for failure to pay child support was vacated and remanded for further findings because, while it was the father's burden to show why the father should not be held in
                        contempt, the could only be so found if sufficient evidence supported each statutory element, and (1) the trial court did not find if the father complied with the most recent order, if the father's compliance could still serve
                        the order's purpose, if any noncompliance were willful, or if the father could comply or take reasonable measures to do so, (2) such findings could not be inferred from the trial court's order, and (3) a mother did not provide
                        a complete record of relevant pleadings or a full transcript of the proceedings before the trial court. Servatius v. Ryals, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 213, 823 S.E.2d 129 (2018).

                        Opposing party must show cause why he should not be found in contempt. In a proceeding to enforce an order for child support, this would involve showing either that he lacked the means to pay or that the failure to pay was not willful. Plott v. Plott,
                        <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 327 S.E.2d 273 (1985).

                    <p>
                        The statutes governing proceedings for civil contempt in child support cases clearly assign the burden of proof to the party alleged to be delinquent, and after a civil contempt proceeding is initiated by an interested party who files a motion in the
                        cause, the opposing party must then show cause why he should not be found in contempt. Belcher v. Averette, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 803, 526 S.E.2d 663 (2000).

                        Evidence sufficient to support finding of contempt. - The trial court properly found that defendant was sufficiently able to comply with the temporary alimony order but willfully, deliberately, and without justification failed to do so where the defendant
                        failed to meet his burden of proof of establishing that he lacked the means to pay or that his failure to pay was not willful; the defendant failed to provide a financial statement or personal bank statements, failed to give his
                        accountant accurate information, failed to explain large sums of money he received from his girlfriend, and was generally vague or indifferent as to supplemental income he did or could receive. Shumaker v. Shumaker,

                        When parties' consent order provided that a wife was to assume financial responsibility for credit card debt, and the wife had the present means and ability to comply, it was not error for the trial court to hold defendant in contempt of court pursuant
                        to G.S. 5A-23(a)(1) for failing to comply with the consent order as it related to the credit card accounts, and to order the wife to pay off the debt as a condition of purging herself of contempt as required by G.S. 5A-21(a)(2).
                        When the wife refused to execute forms requested by the Internal Revenue Service in order to file amended tax returns, as required under the parties' consent order, it was not error for the court to order defendant to sign these
                        form. Watson v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 652 S.E.2d 310 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 373</cite>, 662 S.E.2d 551 (2008).

                        Judge was authorized to shorten notice period of civil contempt hearing for good cause, where the defendant had known for several months of the particular charges pending against him and had had ample opportunity to prepare to meet them, where all the
                        witnesses, some of whom had been in court on earlier occasions, were present, along with the parties, and where defendant's lawyer acknowledged that his argument for delaying the hearing was based, not upon any unreadiness to proceed,
                        but upon his mistaken impression that a hearing upon less than five days notice was automatically invalid. M.G. Newell Co. v. Wyrick, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 98, 370 S.E.2d 431 (1988).

                        Service on a father of a motion by the mother, and ex-wife of the father, of a motion to show cause and a notice of a hearing 27 days before the scheduled hearing was adequate notice of a contempt proceeding in a case where the mother claimed that the

                        Defendants in a summary ejectment proceeding were not given proper notice of a civil contempt proceeding as required by G.S. 5A-23(a). They were not told until the end of the summary ejectment trial that they would be held in contempt until the debt was
                        paid; they were taken immediately to jail; and no good cause for the lack of notice had been shown. Carter v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 650 S.E.2d 843 (2007).

                        In divorce proceedings, a trial court erred by holding a husband in contempt because the wife failed to comply with the notice requirements of G.S. 5A-23(a1) and the trial court failed to provide any mechanism by which the husband could purge himself
                        of contempt, as required by G.S. 5A-23(e). Ross v. Ross, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 546, 715 S.E.2d 859 (2011).

                        a defense to enforcement of the order, and there was sufficient notice to the father and good cause to hear the proceeding on short notice. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 166,

                        Defendant Held Not Entitled to Notice. - Where the defendant had notice of civil contempt hearing and he was simultaneously adjudged to be in both civil and criminal contempt, defendant was entitled to no notice as to the criminal contempt, as subsection
                        (g) of this section expressly authorizes a judge conducting a hearing to determine civil contempt to "find the person in criminal contempt for the same conduct" upon making the required findings. M.G. Newell Co. v. Wyrick,

                        Requirement for Proper Verification. - Although the language used in this section seems to be permissive in nature, prior case law under the antecedent statute established that, in cases of civil contempt, previously denominated as cases as for contempt,
                        a petition, affidavit, or other proper verification charging a willful violation of an order of court was necessary in order for an order to show cause to issue. The legislature has not altered this requirement. Lowder v. All Star

                    <p>
                        Waiver of Procedural Requirements. - Where defendant was accused of mismanaging, diverting and wasting corporate assets and the trial court ordered him to cooperate with receivers of the corporation and to provide them and plaintiffs with copies of his
                        tax returns and a list of his assets, defendant's contempt, if any, in failing to provide the required materials could be criminal or civil, and contemnor waived procedural requirements when he came into court to answer charges
                        of the trial court's show cause order. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 561</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 247 (1981).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although a trial court erroneously allocated the burden of proof to a former wife in civil contempt proceedings initiated by the former husband's filing of a motion, G.S. 5A-23(a1), the wife waived any objection to the burden of proof issue on appeal
                        because she did not object to the trial court's action and acquiesced in the procedure employed by the trial court. Moss v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. App.</cite> 75, 730 S.E.2d 203 (2012).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction Conferred by General Appearance. - The defendant's appearance in court on the scheduled date and participation in the contempt proceedings constituted a general appearance which conferred jurisdiction over her person, despite the fact that
                        the plaintiff's motion instigating the civil contempt proceedings was not accompanied by a sworn statement or affidavit and no order or notice by a judicial official directing the defendant to appear and show cause why she should
                        not be held in civil contempt was ever issued or served upon her. Bethea v. McDonald, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 320 S.E.2d 690 (1984).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Willfulness Required. - Although the statutes governing civil contempt do not expressly require willful conduct, case law has interpreted the statutes to require an element of willfulness. Sharpe v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite>                        705, 493 S.E.2d 288 (1997).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No Evidence of Ability to Pay. - Record was devoid of evidence of defendant's ability to pay the child support amount or purge amount at the time of the hearing; while the record included her 2016 affidavit of indigency, it was not evidence of her present
                        ability to pay at the time of the hearing. Cumberland Cty. ex rel. Mitchell v. Manning, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 383, 822 S.E.2d 305 (2018).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Burden of Proof. - Because the trial court erroneously placed the burden on the father to prove a lack of wilful contempt for failing to meet his child support payments, the trial court's finding of fact did not support its conclusion of law; thus, the
                        appellate court vacated the father's adjudication of wilful civil contempt. Trivette v. Trivette, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 590 S.E.2d 298 (2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the trial court's order failing to hold the father in civil contempt over the parties' visitation agreement, the court held that the trial court did not improperly place the burden of proof on the mother and not on the father because the father met
                        his burden to provide evidence in response to the show cause order to show why he should not be held in willful contempt with competent evidence that the trial court determined was credible, and the burden then shifted back to
                        the mother to refute his evidence, but she elected not to present any evidence. Grissom v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 821 S.E.2d 454 (2018), review denied, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 85
                        (2019).

                    <p>
                        Purge Conditions In Written Order Controlled. - Order finding a husband's non-compliance with purge conditions was vacated because (1) the husband could not comply with the conditions in a written order, (2) the order was impermissibly vague as the order's
                        conditions had no end date, and, (3) despite the husband's compliance with a condition to reduce tax withholding, a condition requiring the husband to consult with a tax professional to reduce withholdings to the maximum extent
                        possible was wrongly added. Spears v. Spears, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 784 S.E.2d 485 (2016).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Appeal Dismissed. - Homeowner's appeal of orders purporting to hold the homeowner in civil contempt for violating no contact orders was dismissed because the orders were not properly entered, as the record did not show (1) an orally rendered judgment
                        was entered or (2) another written order was filed with the clerk of court, so an appellate court had no subject matter jurisdiction to consider the appeal. McKinney v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite>                        717, 808 S.E.2d 509 (2017).

        Jurisdiction.
       </b> - Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review the trial court's contempt order, finding a former husband in criminal contempt for failure to pay spousal support, but not in contempt for failure to pay child support,
                        because it was unclear whether the order was grounded in civil or criminal contempt, the former wife failed to articulate any basis for appealing the order, and failed to present any adequate basis to determine the appellate court's
                        jurisdiction. Hardy v. Hardy, - N.C. App. - , 842 S.E.2d 148 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Nature of Order. - Where order allowed mother to purge the contempt by delivering the child over to the father for his scheduled visitation and by turning over the father's property or otherwise consenting to a search of her home, the contempt order was
                        actually civil in nature. Hancock v. Hancock, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 471 S.E.2d 415 (1996).

                        Contempt Fine. - When a contemnor was found in contempt for violating a no-contact order, a fine was an authorized sanction because, reading G.S. 5A-21, 50C-10, 5A-25, and 50C-5 together, the statutes supported the inference that fines were authorized.
                        Tyll v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 758 S.E.2d 411 (2014).

                        civil contempt findings and a "purge" clause, and (3) construing the order as a civil contempt order was consistent with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050C.html#t50Cs50C-10" target="_blank">G.S. 50C-10</a></cite>                        and G.S. 5A-25's default civil contempt rule.
