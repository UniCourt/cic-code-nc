   <p>
    Liability of Cosmetologist.
   
   - Like the physician, or other person undertaking to perform professional services, the cosmetologist is not an insurer against injury from the treatment she undertakes to render, nor is she liable for the consequences of every error of judgment.

    Employer Need Not Personally Direct Each Act of Apprentice.
   
   - It was not the intent of prior similar provision to impose upon the employer of an apprentice cosmetologist a duty, owed to customers of the establishment, to stand at the side of the apprentice and personally direct each act performed in the rendering of each service to each customer. Johnson v. Lamb, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 701</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 131 (1968).

    Assignment of Customer to Inexperienced Apprentice.
   
   - The proprietor of a beauty salon may not, by the assignment of a customer to an inexperienced apprentice, nothing else appearing, reduce the undertaking of the proprietor to bring to the performance of the service the degree of professional skill and ability ordinarily possessed by those engaged in the trade in the particular locality or area. If, however, the apprentice performing the service possesses such skill, exercises reasonable care in the application of it to the customer's
   case, and uses her best judgment in the performance of the service, there can be no liability for injury upon either the apprentice or the proprietor of a salon on the basis of negligence in the performance of the service.

    Variance.
   
   - Where defendant was tried upon a warrant charging that she permitted persons in her employ to practice as apprentices without certificate of registration as registered apprentices or registered cosmetologists, and the jury returned a special verdict to the effect that defendant permitted unlicensed students to work in her school, there was a fatal variance between the warrant and the special verdict and a failure of proof, and the adjudication that the defendant was not guilty was affirmed. State v. McIver, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 734</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 493 (1940), decided under former statutory provisions.
