                    <p>
                        Construction of "Notarial Acts." - In a case in which defendant appealed his conviction for performing a notarial act without a commission, in violation of G.S. 10B-60(e), he argued unsuccessfully that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss for insufficient
                        evidence because the statute prohibited notarial acts rather than a single notarial act, and the State was required to prove that he performed the functions of a notary on more than one occasion. As mandated by G.S 12-3(1), G.S.
                        10B-60(e) meant that a person violated the statute if the person performed one or more notarial acts with the knowledge that he or she was not a commissioned notary; defendant's interpretation led to untoward consequences undermining

        Presumption of Regularity.
       </b> - As there was no evidence of fraud on the part of the notary, or evidence of a knowing and deliberate violation, and a husband never claimed that he did not sign a separation and property settlement agreement in the
                        present of the notary, the agreement itself should at the very least been accorded a presumption of regularity, and that would preclude the dismissal of the wife's complaint alleging that the husband failed to perform his obligations
                        under the agreement. Sfreddo v. Hicks, - N.C. App. - , 831 S.E.2d 353 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because a husband presented no evidence to rebut the regularity of the notarization of a separation and property settlement agreement, and the wife's evidence supported the presumption, the trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that the agreement
                        was void on the ground that it was not properly acknowledged; the husband presented no affidavit and no evidence, and he signed the agreement before the notary. Sfreddo v. Hicks, - N.C. App. - , 831 S.E.2d 353 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Notary Not Required to Administer Oath. - Birth mother's relinquishment was not invalid for a notary's failure to put the mother "under oath" because: (1) G.S. 10B-3(14) did not require a notary to administer the oath; and (2) when a social worker administered
                        the oath, a notary was present, knew the circumstances, and implicitly assented. In re Adoption of 'Baby Boy', <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 757 S.E.2d 343 (2014).

                        Signature on Custody Petition Found Inadequate. - Petitions for nonsecure custody filed by DSS did not comply with G.S. 7B-403, DSS was not an agency awarded custody of the minor children by a court of competent jurisdiction, DSS did not have standing
                        under G.S. 7B-1103(a)(3) to file the termination of parental rights petitions, and the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enter the termination orders as: (1) the petition for adjudication with respect to child
                        one contained a "Signature of Petitioner" as the "Director of DSS by an employee" and did not contain the signature of the director under G.S. 10B-3(25); (2) DSS filed an amended petition regarding child two with no signature in
                        the "Signature of Petitioner" space; and (3) the orders awarding DSS custody were void ab initio. In re S.E.P., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 481, 646 S.E.2d 617 (2007).

                        Vow of Truthfulness Met. - Birth mother met G.S. 10B-3(14)(c)'s requirement of a vow of truthfulness when signing a relinquishment petition because: (1) she stated in writing that she was "duly sworn;" and (2) a social worker read the word "swear" in
                        administering an oath to her. In re Adoption of 'Baby Boy', <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 757 S.E.2d 343 (2014).

        Deed of Trust Valid.
       </b> - Where the notary's acknowledgment of a debtor's execution left blank the space where the name of the debtor, as the person executing the deed of trust, should have been written, the deed of trust was not invalid under
                        North Carolina's Notary Public Act by reason of the omission in the notarial acknowledgment, because North Carolina courts would not find a properly executed and recorded deed of trust invalid based solely on the omission of the

                    <p>
                        Origin. - The office of notary public has long been known both to the civil and to the common law. State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 333</cite>, 85 S.E. 418 (1915).

                        In Loan Co. v. Turrell, 19 Ind. 469, it was said: "The office originated in the early Roman jurisprudence, and was known in England before the Conquest." State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 333</cite>,
                        85 S.E. 418 (1915).

                    <p>
                        Modern Status of Office. - The office of notary public is in most of the states a state office, although in few states it has been regarded as a county office, and its functions, once simple, have now a wider scope. State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Knight,
                        <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 333</cite>, 85 S.E. 418 (1915).

                    <p>
                        Who Is Eligible. - It has been said that "at common law a minor is eligible to the position of notary public." State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 333</cite>, 85 S.E. 418 (1915). But see now subdivision

        Oath of Office for Notary Public.

                        be sent such commission. If the appointee will be working in more than one county, a copy of the commission should be sent to each county. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Ludelle Hatley, Notaries Public Deputy, Department

                        Construction. - G.S. 10B-20(c)(5) in conjunction with G.S. 47-62 indicates that "attorney, counsel or otherwise" is meant to include persons that may have drafted or otherwise participated in the preparation of the document; using the rule of ejusdem
                        generis leads to the same conclusion as the word "otherwise" is presumed to be and construed as restricted by the particular designations and as including only things of the same kind, character and nature as those specifically
                        enumerated. Quinn v. Quinn, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 777 S.E.2d 121 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Scope of Powers. - A notary public is recognized by the universal law of civilized and commercial nations, but his powers are confined to the authentication of commercial papers and to the protesting of bills of exchange and the like. Benedict, Hall &amp;
                        Co. v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 113</cite> (1877).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By statute in this State the powers of notaries public have been extended beyond those which were incident to the office by the universal law merchant, and pertained to the presentment of bills of exchange for acceptance or payment and the protest thereof
                        for nonpayment or refusal to accept; they may now take and certify the acknowledgment or proof of powers of attorney, mortgages, deeds and other instruments of writing, etc. McNeal Pipe &amp; Foundry Co. v. Woltman, Keith &amp;
                        Co., <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 178</cite>, 19 S.E. 109 (1894).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Duty in Taking Acknowledgments. - The notary was required "to take and certify the acknowledgment or proof" and this imposed upon him the duty of ascertaining (1) that the persons who presented themselves were the grantors in the deed; (2) that they acknowledged
                        the executions of it; (3) that the wife signed the deed freely and voluntarily, and that she voluntarily assented thereto. Young v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 144</cite> (1885); Darden v. Neuse
                        &amp; Trent River Steamboat Co., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 437</cite>, 12 S.E. 46 (1890); State ex rel. Att'y Gen. v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 333</cite>, 85 S.E. 418 (1915).

                    <p>
                        Acknowledgment Is a Judicial or Quasi Judicial Act. - An acknowledgment of a deed, taken before a notary public, is a judicial, or at least a quasi judicial, act. Long v. Crews, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 256</cite>, 18 S.E.
                        499 (1893).

                    <p>
                        Protest as Evidence. - The protest of a notary establishes the facts stated in it in respect to each and all of these points to the full extent the notary could do it if he were examined as a witness and were believed. McNeal Pipe &amp; Foundry Co. v.
                        Woltman, Keith &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 178</cite>, 19 S.E. 109 (1894).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was for convenience of commerce and to dispense with the necessity of bringing witnesses from a distance or of taking depositions to prove the facts certified to in the protest, the certificate being prima facie true. Elliott v. White,
                        <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. 98</cite> (1858); McNeal Pipe &amp; Foundry Co. v. Woltman, Keith &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 178</cite>, 19 S.E. 109 (1894).

                    <p>
                        Certificate as Prima Facie Evidence. - The certificate of the notary established prima facie that electors were sworn as required by statute when they signed the affidavits accompanying their absentee ballots. State ex rel. Owens v. Chaplin,
                        <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 797</cite>, 48 S.E.2d 37 (1948).

                    <p>
                        With the extension of the powers of notaries to take probate of deeds, the same quality attaches to their certificates of probate or acknowledgment; it is prima facie evidence of the truth of its pertinent recitals. McNeal Pipe &amp; Foundry Co. v. Woltman,
                        Keith &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 178</cite>, 19 S.E. 109 (1894).

                        Notary Public Was Not Disqualified to Act because He Was Employed by Grantee. - A notary public was not disqualified to take acknowledgment of grantors and privy examination of married women to conveyances of land when he was an employee of the grantee,
                        without any interest in the land conveyed. Smith v. Ayden Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 47</cite>, 56 S.E. 555 (1907).

                    <p>
                        Where a notary public was interested in a deed of trust, he was disqualified to take the acknowledgment, his attempted action was a nullity, and such defect could not be cured by probate upon such acknowledgment before the clerk and registration. Long

                        Signing of documents for corporation solely in capacity as notary public. - Where defendant signed subcontractor corporation's applications for payment solely in her capacity as a notary public, she did not act in her capacity as director of the corporation
                        or certify the documents individually; therefore, it was error to include her as named individual defendant in issues and instructions submitted to the jury in an action for fraud and gross negligence based upon representations
                        contained in the applications. Myers &amp; Chapman, Inc. v. Thomas G. Evans, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 559</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 385 (1988), rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 117</cite>,

                        Evidence Insufficient as to Signature. - Evidence was insufficient to hold that the signature of a blind property owner's name on a lease was a valid indication of the owner's mutual assent to contract because, although the owner's wife made the owner's
                        signature on the lease, there was no evidence the signature was witnessed by two disinterested persons distinct from a notary who witnessed the signing. Barbee v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite>                        349, 660 S.E.2d 135 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 122</cite>, 672 S.E.2d 682 (2009).

                        Deed Void. - There was no genuine issue of material fact as to the validity of a deed because the deed was void whether due to notarization if the deed was to the notary and her husband or the deed was materially altered after execution without the grantor's
                        knowledge or consent; statue could not cure any defect in notarization as to the notary if she was in fact a grantee under the deed she notarized. Quinn v. Quinn, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite>                        374, 777 S.E.2d 121 (2015).

        An attorney may notarize a document for a client and then represent that client in a legal matter relating to the same document.

                        <b>
        Verification by Partner of Firm Representing Client.
       </b> - It is not advisable for a notary who is also a partner in a law firm acting of counsel to an attorney filing a divorce complaint to notarize the verification of the client. A divorce complaint which is not properly
                        notarized is subject to dismissal. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James Lee Knight, Notary Public, Guilford County, 58 N.C.A.G. 35 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When one partner of Firm A appears as attorney for a plaintiff in a divorce proceeding, the other partners in the firm also "appear," and they could be prohibited under G.S. 47-8 from notarizing the verification of the client. This would be true whether
                        or not the firm appears as "of counsel" to the individual partner on the face of the complaint or answer. Therefore, such practice should be avoided, and an attorney/notary who acts in this fashion proceeds at his own risk. See
                        opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James Lee Knight, Notary Public, Guilford County, 58 N.C.A.G. 35 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pleadings not requiring verification by one of the parties are not subject to dismissal if they are verified anyway and a partner of the firm representing that client acts as the notary. However, G.S. 47-8 would still seem to say that that partner is
                        without power to act as notary in that situation. The signature of the attorney signing the pleadings would be adequate under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 11(a). See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James Lee Knight, Notary Public, Guilford
                        County, 58 N.C.A.G. 35 (1988).

                        Courts Take Judicial Notice. - It was said in Pierce v. Indseth, 106 U.S. 546, 1 S. Ct. 418, 27 L. Ed. 254 (1882): "The court will take judicial notice of the seals of notaries public, for they are officers recognized by the commercial law of the world."
                        State ex rel. Att'y Gen. v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 333</cite>, 85 S.E. 418 (1915).

                    <p>
                        Name in Seal. - The statute authorizing a notary public to take acknowledgment of deeds did not formerly require that his name or any name be used in the notarial seal, and the seal appended to the certificate was presumably his in the absence of evidence
                        to the contrary; hence, where the fact of the execution of deed by a notary public was adjudged to have been proved by such seal and certificate, it was not rebutted by the mere fact that the notary signed his name "Geo. Theo.
                        Somner" and the seal had on it the name of "Theo. Somner." Deans v. Pate, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 194</cite>, 19 S.E. 146 (1894). But see now

                    <p>
                        Failure to Attest by Seal. - A motion for judgment for want of an answer was properly allowed when the complaint was duly verified and what purported to be the verification of the answer was attested only by a person signing his name with the letters
                        "N. P." added thereto, but without an official seal. Tucker v. Inter-States Life Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 796</cite>, 17 S.E. 532 (1893).

                        Under prior law, the acknowledgment of a deed before a notary public in due form was not defective because not attested by his notarial seal. Peel v. Corey, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 79</cite>, 144 S.E. 559 (1928).

                        One Act Sufficient for Violation. - In a case in which defendant appealed his conviction for performing a notarial act without a commission, in violation of G.S. 10B-60(e), he argued unsuccessfully that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss for
                        insufficient evidence because the statute prohibited notarial acts rather than a single notarial act, and the State was required to prove that he performed the functions of a notary on more than one occasion. As mandated by G.S.
                        12-3(1), G.S. 10B-60(e) meant that a person violated the statute if the person performed one or more notarial acts with the knowledge that he or she was not a commissioned notary; defendant's interpretation led to untoward consequences

        Presumption of Regularity Rebutted.

                        and the disputed signature of the debtor on the Deed of Trust bore similarities to her husband's signature. In re Thomas, - Bankr. - (Bankr. M.D.N.C. Aug. 24, 2015).

                        Presumption Did Not Contradict Court Finding. - Trial court's finding that a mother did not, as a matter of fact, receive an original or copy of the consent of adoption at the time it was signed did not contradict the certification by the notary where
                        it was entirely possible that: (1) the notary believed or to the best of his knowledge thought an original or copy of the consent had been left with the mother without any actual knowledge thereof; and (2) no such original or copy
                        had, in fact, been delivered. In re Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 810 S.E.2d 740 (2018).

        Separation And Property Settlement Agreement.

                        as a matter of law that the agreement was void on the ground that it was not properly acknowledged; the husband presented no affidavit and no evidence, and he signed the agreement before the notary. Sfreddo v. Hicks, - N.C. App.

        Separation And Property Settlement Agreement.

                        present of the notary, the agreement itself should at the very least been accorded a presumption of regularity, and that would preclude the dismissal of the wife's complaint alleging that the husband failed to perform his obligations
