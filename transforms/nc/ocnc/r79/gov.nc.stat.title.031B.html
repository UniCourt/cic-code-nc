     Effect of Amendments.
    </b> - Session Laws 2009-48, s. 1, effective October 1, 2009, and applicable to renunciations and powers of attorney executed on or after that date, rewrote the section.
        </p>
        <p>
            Session Laws 2011-284, s. 35, effective June 24, 2011, deleted subdivision (a)(4), which read: "Legatee."

        <p>
            Session Laws 2017-102, s. 11, effective July 12, 2017, substituted "Appointee, permissible appointee, or taker in default" for "Appointee" in subdivision (a)(8).

     CASE NOTES
    </b>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Public policy of this State permits renunciation of property interests transferred by will. Sedberry v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 302 S.E.2d 924, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 322</cite>, 307 S.E.2d
            167 (1983).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Wrongful Death Recoveries. - The legislature did not intend for the renouncement statute to apply to wrongful death recoveries. The language of the renouncement statute, contains a long and specific list of the capacities in which one must succeed to
            an interest which may be renounced and that list, as exhaustive as it was obviously intended to be, does not include beneficiaries of wrongful death recoveries. Evans v. Diaz, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 774</cite>, 430 S.E.2d
            244 (1993).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Other Renunciation Procedures Not Abridged. - While a statutory method for accomplishing renunciation is provided in this section and G.S. 31B-2, such provision expressly does not abridge the right to waive, release, disclaim or renounce property or an
            interest therein under any other statute or as otherwise provided by law. Sedberry v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 302 S.E.2d 924, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 322</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 167
            (1983).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            When Release by Heir of Expectant Share Is Binding. - The release by an heir of an expectant share is binding if the release is given for a valuable consideration and the consideration given for the release is not "grossly inadequate," or procured by
            fraud or undue influence. In re Will of Edgerton, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 60, 223 S.E.2d 524, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 308</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 832 (1976).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Separation Agreement as Renunciation. - Where a husband executes a will divising and bequeathing all his property to his wife, the spouses thereafter enter a separation agreement in which each "waives and renounces all rights . . . under any previously
            executed will of the other," and the husband subsequently dies without having revoked or modified his will, the separation agreement constitutes a valid renunciation which adeems the devise and bequest to the wife. Sedberry v. Johnson,
            <cite
                class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 425, 302 S.E.2d 924, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 322</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 167 (1983).
                <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Beneficiary of a spendthrift trust created by trustor's will, who had only a life estate in the trust fund, while his unborn children and brothers and sisters had a contingent interest in the remainder, could renounce his life estate, but could not renounce
            the interest of his unborn children or accelerate the remainder for the benefit of his brothers and sisters. Stewart v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 277, 362 S.E.2d 849 (1987), cert. denied, 373 S.E.2d 124

                Prior to renouncing, if a fiduciary so elects, the fiduciary may institute a proceeding by petition before the clerk of court for a determination as to whether a renunciation would be compatible with the fiduciary's duties. In the case of a trustee, commencement
                of the proceeding, jurisdiction, venue, parties, representation, and notice shall be governed by Chapter 36C of the General Statutes. In the case of a personal representative, commencement of the proceeding, jurisdiction, venue, parties,
                representation, and notice shall be governed by Chapter 28A of the General Statutes. In addition to any other notice requirements, notice of the proceeding shall be given to all persons entitled to delivery of a copy of an instrument of

                To be a qualified disclaimer for federal and State inheritance, estate, and gift tax purposes, an instrument of renunciation shall be filed within the time period required under the applicable federal statute for a renunciation to be given effect as a

                of the instrument of renunciation, and, as provided in G.S. 31B-3(a)(1), the spouse has no statutory dower, inchoate marital rights, elective share, or any other marital interest in the real property or real property interest renounced.

                The renunciation is effective when filed with the clerk of court (i) in the county in which court proceedings have been commenced for the administration of the estate of the deceased owner or deceased creator of the power or holder of the power; or (ii)
                if proceedings have not been commenced, then in a county in which they could be commenced; or (iii) in all other cases, in a county with a court that has jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the instrument creating the interest renounced.
                In those cases in which an estate proceeding has not been commenced, the renunciation shall be filed as an estate matter. In addition to the above requirements, a renunciation of real property, or an interest therein, shall be registered

                or creator of the  power or holder of the power, and (ii) the name of the person whose property or interest is being renounced.  Failure to file or register the instrument of renunciation does not affect the effectiveness of the renunciation
                as between the person whose property or interest is being renounced and persons to whom the property interest or power passes by reason of the renunciation; however, record title to a renounced interest in real property does not pass to
