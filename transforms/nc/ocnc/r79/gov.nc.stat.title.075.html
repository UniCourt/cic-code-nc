                            Under the common law at a remote period in England, the term "contract in restraint of trade" meant an individual's voluntary contractual restraint on his right to carry on his trade or calling. Rose v. Vulcan Materials Co.,

                            This Chapter establishes an action for unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The jury determines the facts, and based on the jury's findings of fact the court must determine as a matter of law whether the defendants engaged in

                            Statutes on monopolies and trusts are addressed to the sale and movement in commerce of goods, wares, merchandise and other things of value. Knutton v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 355</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 29 (1968).

                            And cases arising under such statutes ordinarily involve a vendor and a purchaser. Knutton v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 355</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 29 (1968).

                            wanton misconduct. A practice is deceptive and treble damages must be awarded under Chapter 75 if the trade practice has the capacity or tendency to deceive. Chapter 75, therefore, allows recovery under a much lower standard
                            than required by admiralty law. Therefore, subcontractor's punitive damages claim under North Carolina's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practice Act was dismissed. Delta Marine, Inc. v. Whaley, 813 F. Supp. 414 (E.D.N.C. 1993).

                            The true test now generally applied to agreements in partial restraint of trade is whether the restraint is such as to afford a fair protection to the interests of the party in whose favor it is given, and not so large as to interfere with the interests
                            of the public. Quadro Stations, Inc. v. Gilley, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 172 S.E.2d 237 (1970).

                            Agreements in Partial Restraint of Trade May Be Upheld. - Agreements in partial restraint of trade will be upheld when they are founded on valuable considerations, are reasonably necessary to protect the interest of the parties in whose favor they are
                            imposed, and do not unduly prejudice the public interest. Waldron Buick Co. v.

                            An individual's voluntary contractual restraint on his right to carry on his trade or calling is prima facie illegal and must be shown to be reasonable by the party seeking to enforce it. Rose v. Vulcan Materials Co.,

                            Agreement Not to Compete May Be Forbidden. - Persons and corporations cannot be ordered to compete, but they properly can be forbidden to give directions, or make agreements, not to compete. State v. Craft, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 208</cite>,

                            Restraint Must Be Reasonable. - A limitation or restriction upon a person's right to engage in a lawful occupation or business is deemed detrimental to the public interest, unless the restraint imposed is reasonable under the proper tests. Waldron Buick

                            Test as to Reasonableness. - A valid contract in partial restraint of trade, while primarily for the advantage of the purchaser of a business, inures to the benefit of the seller by enhancing the value of the goodwill and enabling him to obtain a better
                            price for the sale of his business, the test as to territory being whether the restraint agreed upon is such as to afford a fair protection to the interest of the party in whose favor it is given, and not so large as to interfere
                            with the interest of the public; and such will not be held to be unreasonable when they do not affect the public and go no further than to remove the danger to the purchaser of competition with the seller. Morehead Sea Food

                        <p>
                            In connection with the sale of a business, including goodwill, the validity of a covenant providing that the seller will not engage in business in competition with the buyer is determinable by these tests: (1) Is it reasonably necessary to protect the
                            legitimate interest of the purchaser? (2) Is the limitation or restriction reasonable in respect of both time and territory? Waldron Buick Co. v. GMC, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 117</cite>, 118

                            It is the rule today that when one sells a trade or business and, as an incident of the sale, covenants not to engage in the same business in competition with the purchaser, the covenant is valid and enforceable (1) if it is reasonably necessary to protect
                            the legitimate interest of the purchaser; (2) if it is reasonable with respect to both time and territory; and (3) if it does not interfere with the interest of the public. Jewel Box Stores Corp. v. Morrow,

                            Enforceability of Covenant Not to Compete. - To be enforceable, a covenant not to compete must protect some substantial interest of the employer. Wilmar, Inc. v. Liles, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 185 S.E.2d

                            By this section, contracts in restraint of trade are made illegal in North Carolina; however, in this State a covenant not to compete is enforceable in equity if it is (1) in writing, (2) entered into at the time and as a part of the contract of employment,
                            (3) based on valuable considerations, (4) reasonable both as to time and territory embraced in the restrictions, (5) fair to the parties and (6) not against public policy. Forrest Paschal Mach. Co. v. Milholen,

                            If covenants not to compete are included in contracts of employment, when the employment preexists the execution of the contracts, there must be some additional consideration to the employee to support his covenant not to compete. Wilmar, Inc. v. Liles,

                        <p>
                            A restrictive covenant not to compete which is the main purpose of a contract and not a subordinate feature is not protected as to enforceability by the exceptions afforded ancillary contracts in restraint of trade permissible in connection with the sale
                            of a going business, a contract of employment, or a lease. Wilmar, Inc. v. Liles, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 185 S.E.2d 278 (1971), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 305</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Since defendant's covenant not to compete lacked an essential element, a statement of any kind of consideration, it was invalid as a matter of law, and the trial court properly dismissed charges as to defendant. Brooks Distrib. Co. v. Pugh,

                            Excluded Territory Must Not Be Unreasonably Extensive. - The territory excluded from competition by an agreement such as this one must be no greater than is reasonably necessary to protect the covenantee's business interest, and if it is unreasonably
                            extensive the entire covenant fails since equity will neither enforce nor reform an overreaching and unreasonable agreement. Beasley v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 458, 368 S.E.2d
                            885 (1988).

                            Reasonableness of Restraints as to Time and Area Considered Together. - Although a valid covenant not to compete must be reasonable as to both time and area, these two requirements are not independent and unrelated aspects of the restraint. Each must
                            be considered in determining the reasonableness of the other. Furthermore, neither is conclusive of the validity of the covenant, but both are important factors in settling that question. Jewel Box Stores Corp. v. Morrow,
                            <cite

                            Whether plaintiff's covenant meets the other requisites need not be determined when it is obvious that plaintiff's judgment is invalid and the covenant involved is unenforceable because the territory excluded from competition is unreasonably extensive.

                            Legitimate Business Interest. - In North Carolina a legitimate business interest is a business interest, not fictitious, which, when weighed against the public's interest in a free economic arena, is worthy of protection in order to encourage and stimulate
                            business efforts and innovations. United Labs., Inc. v. Kuykendall, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 296, 361 S.E.2d 292 (1987), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 643</cite>,

                            Restrictive Stipulations in Sale of Business Usually Sustained. - Transactions involving the sale and disposition of a business, trade or profession between individuals with stipulations restrictive of competition on the part of the vendor do not, as
                            a rule, tend to unduly harm the public and are ordinarily sustained to the extent required to afford reasonable protection to the vendee in the enjoyment of property or proprietary rights he has bought and paid for, and to
                            enable a vendor to dispose of his property at its full and fair value. Mar-Hof Co. v. Rosenbacker, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 330</cite>, 97 S.E. 169 (1918).

                            The modern rule permitting the sale of goodwill recognizes that one who, by his skill and industry, builds up a business, acquires a property right in the goodwill of his patrons and that this property is not marketable unless the owner is at liberty
                            to sell his right of competition to the full extent of the field from which he derives his profit and for a reasonable length of time. Where the contract is between individuals or between private corporations, which do not
                            belong to the quasi-public class, there is no reason why the general rule that the seller should not be allowed to fix the time for the operation of the restriction so as to command the highest market price for the property
                            he disposes of should apply. Jewel Box Stores Corp. v. Morrow, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 659</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 840 (1968).

                            Covenants restricting use of property for purposes competitive with those of the covenantees have generally been held to be enforceable where they involve only partial restraints of trade, are found on sufficient consideration and are reasonably limited

                            Although the courts will not tolerate unreasonable restraints upon trade, and frown upon restrictions upon the free use of land, there is no doubt of the validity, under ordinary circumstances, of a restriction imposed by a lessor, ancillary to a leasing
                            of part of his property, upon the remainder of the property owned or controlled. Quadro Stations, Inc. v. Gilley, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 172 S.E.2d 237 (1970).

                            It appears to be well settled that the seller or lessor of property (as distinguished from business or goodwill) may be a reasonably limited restrictive promise agree to refrain from (1) himself engaging in, or (2) from disposing of his property in such
                            a way that others can engage in, a business which would impair the value of the property to the buyer for the purpose for which he intended to use it. Quadro Stations, Inc. v. Gilley, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite>                            227, 172 S.E.2d 237 (1970).

                            The owner of a business, who also owns land nearby, may sell or lease such land to a buyer or tenant who promises not to use it for business purposes in competition with that of the seller or lessor. Here, the restriction is limited to the use of the
                            land transferred. Or, the owner of a tract of land or business block may sell or lease a portion thereof to one intending to use it for a particular purpose, making to him an ancillary promise not to permit the remaining part
                            of the tract or building to be used for a competitive business purpose. These agreements are usually sustained as being reasonable, even though the purpose is to prevent competition and no business goodwill is being transferred.

                            Agreement by Employee Not to Compete with Employer. - The validity of a covenant in a contract of employment providing that, upon termination of the employer-employee relationship, the employee will not engage in a business in competition with the employer,
                            is determinable by these tests: (1) Is it founded on a valuable consideration? (2) Is it reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the employer? (3) Is the limitation or restriction reasonable in respect of

                            employment within the solid state electronic equipment industry only to companies that did not compete with the Greensboro branch office and surrounding area in any manner, regardless of how far away employee moved to obtain
                            work, regardless of the position employee accepted and regardless of the protection of the company's interest at the time by the trial court's injunction on employee prohibiting disclosure of information acquired while he worked
                            with the company; therefore, the covenant violated the public's and employee's interest in his earning a living, and the trial judge correctly denied the company's request for a preliminary injunction enforcing the noncompetition

                            Reduction of Prices to Consuming Public No Defense. - Plaintiff, a carrier by truck, instituted this action against certain railroad companies, to recover damages to his business, which he alleged resulted from an unlawful conspiracy between defendants
                            to reduce transportation rates in order to eliminate plaintiff as a competitor, with the purpose of raising rates after competition had been removed. Defendants alleged that the reduction in rates resulted in lower prices to
                            the consuming public on the products on which the rates had been reduced. It was held that the matter alleged does not constitute a defense to the action, since the express policy of the State is against both the raising and
                            lowering of prices by unlawful means for an unlawful purpose, and since the law is interested in preserving competition rather than obtaining for the public temporary benefits from price wars in which competition is extinguished.

                            only those methods of measuring damages could be used. To rule otherwise would produce the anomalous result of recognizing that although this section creates a cause of action broader than traditional common-law actions, G.S.
                            75-16 limits the availability of any remedy to cases where some recovery at common law would probably also lie. Bernard v.

                            The Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act covers claims arising out of employer-employee relations; therefore, where the plaintiff presented evidence that defendant deceptively used a position of confidence to solicit the plaintiff's customers and
                            to compete with the plaintiff while still in his employment and that he concealed his behavior from the plaintiff, the plaintiff has demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact preventing summary judgment. Dalton v. Camp,

                            Hourly production workers made some attempt to establish the viability of their unfair trade practices claim, however, the employer argued convincingly to the contrary; under the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, G.S. 75-1.1, it
                            was unlawful to engage in unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, G.S. 75-1.1(a). Although the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act was
                            intended to benefit consumers, its protections extend to businesses in appropriate situations, but the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act did not normally extend to run-of-the-mill employment disputes and when the Supreme
                            Court of North Carolina has allowed Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act claims in employer-employee disputes, it was in circumstances not present in the instant case: for example, claims brought by employers against employees

                            Home sellers were entitled to partial summary judgment regarding the home buyer's unfair and deceptive practices claim against the sellers because private homeowners selling their personal residence were exempt from the purview of the North Carolina unfair

                            Determination of Unfairness of Conduct. - Unfair competition has been referred to in terms of conduct which a court of equity would consider unfair. Thus viewed, the fairness or unfairness of particular conduct is not an abstraction to be derived by logic.
                            Rather, the fair or unfair nature of particular conduct is to be judged by viewing it against the background of actual human experience and by determining its intended and actual effects upon others. Harrington Mfg. Co. v.

                            Insurer acted reasonably to investigate a highly unusual and suspicious claim; the fire department found the insured's uncle was the prime suspect in setting the fire and because the policy excluded losses from intentional acts done by the named insured
                            or other insureds (which included relatives living at the house), it was perfectly reasonable for the insurer to take statements from the insured and his mother and uncle/stepfather that lived at the house. It was also reasonable
                            for the insurer to conclude that the insured had made material misrepresentations on his policy application and to thus deny the claim. Riddle v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., - F. Supp. 2d - (E.D.N.C. July 17, 2009).

                            In a case in which an insurer filed a motion for summary judgment as to the insured's unfair and deceptive trade practices claims, violations of G.S. 58-63-15 were violations of G.S. 75-1.1 as a matter of law. The insured produced competent evidence to
                            support their claim that the insurer did not commence a timely investigation, and there was a genuine issue of material fact for the jury as to whether the insurer met its statutory duties. Cleveland Constr., Inc. v. Fireman's

                            While a "no growth" designation, used punitively by supplier against distributor to freeze his allocation, could have some effect on a distributor's inclinations toward expanding either its territory or its suppliers, plaintiff distributor had the burden

                            a commission, discount or bonus was guilty of commercial bribery as the proper title of G.S. 14-353 was "Influencing agents and servants in violating duties owed employers," and the undisputed evidence showed that defendant
                            himself had designed and established the system of payments in question with the explicit purpose of rewarding an employee's diligence, the cooperation of plaintiff in facilitating such a scheme at defendant's request could

                            trade practices claims (UDTP), where the UDTP claim rested upon an allegation under the first prong of the commercial bribery statute, proof of the defendant's intent to influence the actions of another's employee had to be
                            proven; (2) as reflected by G.S. 14-353's title and the very definition of the term, as well as by common sense, commercial bribery involved an inducement to give the bribe-giver an unfair advantage or benefit in a business
                            relationship; and (3) acts of commercial bribery had to result in or be intended to result in some disloyalty or harm to the employer and some benefit to the bribe-giver. Capital Res., LLC v. Chelda, Inc.,

                            be reimbursed upon closing of the asset purchase, but the buyer had no intention of closing on the sale and used the pending sale to induce the corporations to continue paying him a salary and profit-sharing bonuses. Gress

                            however, the sale of unapproved SPCI regarding loans having terms greater than 15 years was an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of G.S. 75-1.1(a). Richardson v. Bank of Am., N.A.,

                            by aggravating circumstances, or that plaintiff was harmed by the breach of contract, summary judgment for defendants was proper on plaintiff's Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices Act claim based on defendants' violation of

         Intentional Breach of Contract.
        </b> - In an action for breach of contract alleging unfair competition, the trial court properly denied treble damages where the defendant's violation of its contractual obligation was an intentional breach, but there
                            was neither unfairness nor deception in formulation of the contract; where the jury found no deception in the circumstances of its breach; where the contract was carefully negotiated and drawn by sophisticated parties; and
                            where there was no hint of any unfairness to either party before the defendant's cessation of performance; thus, no unfairness inhered in the circumstances of the breach within the meaning of this section simply because the
                            breach was intentional and not properly disclosed. United Roasters, Inc. v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 649 F.2d 985 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1054, 102 S. Ct. 599, 70 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1981).

                            Defendants' claim that plaintiff submitted low bids for contracts and then later overcharged its customers, that plaintiff secured contracts that defendants also made bids on, and that plaintiff lured away some of defendants' customers with its seemingly
                            lower fees did not provide a cause of action to defendants under this section; the statute is not so inclusive as to permit one competitor to claim unfair or deceptive trade practices on the ground that another competitor successfully

                            rendered, and if those owners refused to pay the bill, plaintiff would threaten seizure and sale of the vessel, defendants failed to show the existence of an act or practice concerning plaintiff's business policies that rose
                            to the appellation "unfair" or "deceptive"; the "threats" of claiming a maritime lien or "papering" any vessel are exercises of valid rights of the plaintiff to assure payment for any services actually performed. Marlen C.

                            had a copyright in the artwork, his hiring of another artist and his omission of plaintiff's name from the attribution bullet on the map did not amount to an unfair or deceptive trade practice. Armento v. Laser Image, Inc.,

                            When a landlord responding to an inquiry from another landlord about a tenant advised the inquiring landlord that the tenant's account was delinquent, this was not an unfair or deceptive practice, under the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, G.S.

                            Trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of unfair and deceptive trade practices under G.S. 75-1.1. The wetlands delineations and a Master Wetlands Map were so facially flawed that a real estate acquisition company could not have reasonably
                            relied on them in deciding to purchase a tract; given the company's experience in developing coastal communities and the fact that the company had unfettered access to the tract, the company could not have actually relied on
                            the Master Wetlands Map that was dated more than two years earlier and signed by an individual no longer employed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Sunset Beach Dev., LLC v. Amec, Inc.,

                            product purchase agreement; (2) marketing allowances were payments for plaintiff's services provided to manufacturers and therefore unrelated to the cost of food products negotiated by plaintiff or directly by its restaurant
                            customers; (3) plaintiff's own cost of food products did not include an offset for marketing allowances, but rather consisted of the cost negotiated with a manufacturer (whether by plaintiff or the restaurants directly); and
                            (4) the negotiated cost for each product listed in the pricing schedules was the proper cost to which plaintiff's markups (as contracted with defendant) were applied. Capital Res., LLC v. Chelda, Inc.,

         Exercise by Lender of Contractual Right to Withdraw Not a Deceptive Trade Practice.

                            Complaint sufficiently asserted an actionable deceptive and unfair trade practice because supplier asserted that buyer repeatedly promised that it would make supplier its exclusive supplier for a certain product in order to induce the supplier to increase

                            Complaint Held Insufficient to State A Claim. - Because employers failed to state a valid claim for tortious interference with contract or misappropriation of trade secrets, they also failed to adequately allege that a competitor committed an unfair or
                            deceptive act or practice; consequently, the employers not stated a valid claim for unfair and deceptive practices, and their complaint was properly dismissed. Krawiec v. Manly, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 602</cite>,

                            Business court properly denied chiropractors declaratory relief on their unfair and deceptive trade practices claims because much of the declaratory relief the chiropractors sought came in the form of legal conclusions that had already been addressed

                            Plaintiff's motion for class certification in an action alleging Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act was denied because the myriad of variations of each plaintiff's situation defeated commonality, and it would have been inappropriate to rule on plaintiff's
                            claims without considering the unique circumstances of individual class members; if a class member understood that the fees initially disclosed were estimates that could have changed before closing, then the claim of "unfair"
                            or "deceptive" act or practice would likely fail, but plaintiff had not articulated a class definition that took into account the understanding of the individuals in each loan transaction. Rose v. SLM Fin. Corp., 254 F.R.D.

                            in the conduct of trade or commerce. However, where the parties stipulated certain facts, the Supreme Court, based on these facts, held as a matter of law that the false representations made by defendants to plaintiff constituted
                            unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce contrary to the provisions of this section, and treble damages should have been awarded as provided by G.S. 75-16 in the amount of $1800. Hardy v. Toler,

                            Statute of Limitations. - Plaintiffs' claims against a trust company and its trustee under G.S. 75-1.1 failed where the statute of limitations for the action began to accrue when plaintiffs closed on their property and as that was more than four years

                            because the claim accrued at the date on which the loan at issued closed, the trial court properly dismissed the complaint on this issue. Shepard v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, FSB, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 137</cite>,

                        Common Law. - Under the common law at a remote period in England, the term contract in restraint of trade meant an individual's voluntary contractual restraint on his right to carry on his trade or calling. Rose v. Vulcan Materials Co.,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">282 N.C. 643</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 521 (1973).

                    <p>
                        At common law in England, and later in this country, only combinations or agreements which operate to the prejudice of the public by unduly or unreasonably restricting competition or restraining trade are illegal. The combination is not objectionable
                        if the restraint is such only as to afford fair protection to the parties thereto and not broad enough to interfere with the interest of the public. Rose v. Vulcan Materials Co., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 643</cite>,

                        Distinction Between Common-Law and Modern Rules. - Originally at common law, agreements in restraint of trade were held void as being against public policy. The position, however, has been more and more modified by the decisions of the courts until it
                        has come to be the very generally accepted principle that agreements in partial restraint of trade will be upheld when they are "founded on valuable considerations, are reasonably necessary to protect the interests of the parties
                        in whose favor they are imposed, and do not unduly prejudice the public interest." Mar-Hof Co. v. Rosenbacker, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 330</cite>, 97 S.E. 169 (1918). The distinction may now be made
                        between "general restraint" and "partial restraint." Morehead Sea Food Co. v. Way, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 679</cite>, 86 S.E. 603 (1915).

        Waiver Not Applicable to Statute of Frauds.
       </b> - Because the statute of frauds under G.S. 75-4 is a public policy consumer protection statute, waiver does not apply to obviate the need for a written agreement. Dealers Supply Co. v. Cheil Indus., 348 F. Supp. 2d
                        579 (M.D.N.C. 2004).

                        Where a former distributor of a manufacturer's products contended that the manufacturer waived its right to assert the statute of frauds by stating that a written distributorship agreement was not necessary since the parties were partners, the requirements
                        of the statute of frauds were not subject to waiver and thus the lack of a written agreement precluded enforcement of the oral distribution agreement. Dealers Supply Co. v. Cheil Indus., 348 F. Supp. 2d 579 (M.D.N.C. 2004).

                        What Contracts Enforceable. - Where affidavits disclose that defendants in the course of their employment acquired knowledge which would give them an unfair advantage over plaintiff in a competitive business, under such circumstances equity will enforce
                        a covenant not to compete if it is: (1) in writing, (2) entered into at the time and as a part of the contract of employment, (3) based on valuable considerations, (4) reasonable both as to time and territory embraced in the restrictions,
                        (5) fair to the parties, and (6) not against public policy. Orkin Exterminating Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 179</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 139 (1962).

                        Oral Contract Void and Unenforceable. - An oral contract which prohibits defendant's right to do business except through plaintiff as its exclusive distributor, limits substantially defendant's right to do business in North Carolina. Hence, under this
                        section, the oral contract is void and unenforceable. Radio Electronics Co. v. Radio Corp. of Am., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 114</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 664 (1956).

                        This section does not require that a noncompetition agreement be set out in a single instrument; a memorandum is sufficient if the necessary contract provisions can be determined from separate but internally related writings. Brooks Distrib. Co. v. Pugh,
                        <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 373 S.E.2d 300 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 326</cite>, 378 S.E.2d 31 (1989).

                        New Contract Required. - When the relationship of employer and employee is already established without a restrictive covenant, any agreement thereafter not to compete must be in the nature of a new contract based upon a new consideration. Forrest Paschal
                        Mach. Co. v. Milholen, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 678, 220 S.E.2d 190 (1975).

                    <p>
                        Person Seeking Enforcement Not Required to Sign. - A covenant not to compete in a contract signed by defendant was valid since this section establishes that contracts or agreements limiting the rights of persons to do business in this State may be enforceable
                        if put in writing "duly signed by the party who agrees not to enter into any such business within such territory" and it is not necessary that the person seeking enforcement of the terms required to be in writing also sign the
                        writing. Manpower of Guilford County, Inc. v. Hedgecock, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 515, 257 S.E.2d 109 (1979).

                        But the Party Agreeing Not to Compete Must Sign. - Agreement not to compete did not meet the signature requirements of this section, despite the fact that the form was notarized by the wife of the company president in the presence of the employee, because
                        the employee printed her name at the top of the form, but there was no cursive script or any writing at all on the signature line of the agreement not to compete immediately preceding the notarization. New Hanover Rent-A-Car, Inc.

                        Execution of Written Contracts After Start of Work. - If covenants not to compete were a part of original verbal employment contract, then they were founded on valuable consideration. The fact that the written contracts were executed after the defendants
                        had started work is insignificant. The covenants became enforceable once they were put in writing and signed by the party to be charged. Robins &amp; Weill, Inc. v.

                        breach of contract claims because plaintiffs alleged that the editors agreed to work for one corporation under terms identical to those under their previous employer and that the corporation accepted their offers; they also alleged

                        Actions not Continuous. - Borrowers' unfair and deceptive trade practices (UDTP) claims did not involve an installment contract, but rather their UDTP claims were solely premised on the bank's and its subsidiary's actions before and at the closing of
                        the borrowers' loans; therefore, the borrowers' UDTP claims accrued at the closing of their loans, and G.S. 75-8 did not extend the statute of limitations because any violation of the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices

                    The Attorney General of the State of North Carolina shall have power, and it shall be his duty, to investigate, from time to time, the affairs of all corporations or persons doing business in this State, which are or may be embraced within the meaning
                    of the statutes of this State defining and denouncing trusts and combinations against trade and commerce, or which he shall be of opinion are so embraced, and all other corporations or persons in North Carolina doing business in violation
                    of law; and all other corporations of every character engaged in this State in the business of transporting property or passengers, or transmitting messages, and all other public service corporations of any kind or nature whatever
                    which are doing business in the State for hire. Such investigation shall be with a view of ascertaining whether the law or any rule of the Utilities Commission or Commission of Banks [Commissioner of Banks] is being or has been violated
                    by any such corporation, officers or agents or employees thereof, and if so, in what respect, with the purpose of acquiring such information as may be necessary to enable him to prosecute any such corporation, its agents, officers
                    and employees for crime, or prosecute civil actions against them if he discovers they are liable and should be prosecuted.

                        Legislative Intent. - Even though individual remedies may exist, the statutes provide for injunctive relief at the instance of the State. To hold otherwise would cripple the legislative intent to provide an effective means of curbing illegitimate business
                        schemes and protecting the consumers of the State. State ex rel. Morgan v. Dare to Be Great, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 189 S.E.2d 802 (1972).

                        Proof of Actual Injury. - Public enforcement through the Attorney General is similar to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the purpose of which is to vindicate public interest rather than to redress individual grievances. Under the federal
                        act, it is not necessary to show actual injury has resulted, but merely that the act or practice complained of adversely affects the public interest, and similarly, there is no suggestion in the North Carolina statutory scheme
                        that the Attorney General would be required to prove such actual injury. State ex rel. Edmisten v. Challenge, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 284 S.E.2d 333 (1981).

                        Applicability of Section to Debt Collection Activities. - Inherent in the remedy of this section is the intent to prohibit only unfair and deceptive practices affecting sales. If the legislature had intended to cover debt collection activities it would
                        have provided for the rescission of contracts not only where the contract is obtained as a result of a violation, but also where a violation occurs which is unrelated to the contract's formation. State ex rel. Edmisten v. J.C.

                        Applicability To Check Cashing Business That Charged Usurious Interest Rates. - Where evidence against a check cashing business established that it executed contracts for usurious loans, it used its alternative business purpose of providing Internet access
                        to consumers as a guise to cover this illegal activity, and no evidentiary basis existed upon which a reasonable fact-finder could reach a contrary conclusion, the State's claims of usury and violations of the Consumer Finance
                        Act were established as a matter of law; moreover, the contracts which customers had with the business were cancelled pursuant to G.S. 75-15.1, requiring all funds collected by the business pursuant to such contracts to be refunded
                        to the customers. State ex rel. Cooper v. NCCS Loans, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 624 S.E.2d 371 (2005).

                        Unnecessary to Return Valueless Property. - It was unnecessary that the parties receiving restitution be ordered to return the drums of mislabeled and useless antifreeze to the seller, where the record clearly showed that the antifreeze had no value.

                        Interest on Judgment. - In an action under former G.S. 75-5 to enjoin deceptive acts and practices in the sale of antifreeze, interest on the court's judgment ordering defendant to make restoration payments to 33 customers was governed by G.S. 24-5 and
                        should have been awarded only from the time of entry of the judgment. State ex rel. Edmisten v. Zim Chem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 604, 263 S.E.2d 849 (1980).

                    In any suit instituted by the Attorney General, in which the defendant is found to have violated G.S. 75-1.1 and the acts or practices which constituted the violation were, when committed, knowingly violative of a statute, the court may, in its discretion,
                    impose a civil penalty against the defendant of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation. In any action brought by the Attorney General pursuant to this Chapter in which it is shown that an action or practice when committed
                    was specifically prohibited by a court order, the Court may, in its discretion, impose a civil penalty of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation. Civil penalties may be imposed in a new action or by motion in an earlier
                    action, whether or not such earlier action has been concluded. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the court shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of the harm caused by the
                    conduct constituting a violation, the nature and persistence of such conduct, the length of time over which the conduct occurred, the assets, liabilities, and net worth of the person, whether corporate or individual, and any corrective
                    action taken by the defendant. The clear proceeds of penalties so assessed shall be remitted to the Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund in accordance with G.S. 115C-457.2.

                            Purpose. - The purpose of the statutory provisions for treble money damages and attorney's fees in this section and G.S. 75-16.1 was to encourage private enforcement in the marketplace and to make the bringing of such suit more economically feasible.

                            Legislative Intent. - It was the clear intention of the General Assembly in enacting G.S. 75-1.1 and this section, among other things, to declare deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce in North Carolina unlawful, to provide
                            civil means to maintain ethical standards of dealings between persons engaged in business and the consuming public within this State and to enable a person injured by deceptive acts or practices to recover treble damages from
                            a wrongdoer. Hardy v. Toler, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 625, 211 S.E.2d 809, modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 303</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 342 (1975); American Craft

                            In enacting this section and G.S. 75-16.1, the legislature intended to establish an effective private cause of action for aggrieved consumers in this State. Marshall v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 539</cite>, 276

                            The legislature's intent in enacting this section was to create a new, private cause of action for aggrieved consumers, since traditional common-law remedies were often deficient. Winston Realty Co. v. G.H.G., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 90</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The North Carolina Legislature must have intended that substantial aggravating circumstances be present before any practice is deemed unfair under G.S. 75-1.1, since it provided that any damages suffered by the victim are to be trebled. General United

                            By enacting the 1969 revisions to this section, the General Assembly clearly intended to expand the class of persons with standing to sue for a violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.075.html" target="_blank">Chapter 75</a></cite>                            to include any person who suffers an injury under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.075.html" target="_blank">Chapter 75</a></cite>, regardless of whether that person purchased directly from the wrongdoer.

                            Actions taken by an investment equity and its principals with respect to a software development firm, which it eventually took over from the original shareholders and others, was not within the ordinary conduct that was covered by the North Carolina Unfair
                            and Deceptive Trade Practices Act such that a claim by the shareholders under G.S. 75-16 did not withstand a dismissal challenge; the conduct involved the equity's use of its position as a senior creditor to pressure the development

                            Section Remedial as Well as Punitive. - This section is partially punitive in nature in that it clearly serves as a deterrent to future violations; but it is also remedial for other reasons, among them the fact that it encourages private enforcement and
                            the fact that it provides a remedy for aggrieved parties. Marshall v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 539</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 397 (1981).

                            Statute Is Not Intended as a Penalty. - It would not be proper for the North Carolina Appeals Court to strain to infer that the General Assembly meant this section to be a penalty where, in the preceding statutory section, the General Assembly has expressly
                            created a "penalty" denominated as such and reserved the authority to enforce the "penalty" to the State's chief law enforcement officer. The language of G.S. 75-15.2 is sufficiently particular for the court to conclude that
                            had the General Assembly intended its sister provision, G.S. 75-16, also to be a "penalty," the General Assembly would have expressly provided for a second "penalty." Holley v. Coggin Pontiac, Inc.,

                            of the North Carolina Clean Water Act enforced as provided for in that section; the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act was created to regulate, among other things, deceptive behavior in the permitting process under the
                            Clean Water Act, and it provides the exclusive statutory remedy for violation thereof. Brinkman v. Barrett Kays &amp; Assocs., P.A., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 738, 575 S.E.2d 40

                            Interest Included in Costs Trebled. - Where, at the time the contract between the parties was made, it was reasonable to expect that if, as a result of defendant's breach, plaintiff was required to spend an additional $15,727.11 over and above the original
                            contract price to complete the log home, additional financing would be necessary, the interest was part of the cost of negotiating new financing and was foreseeable as a natural and contemplated result of borrowing money; therefore,
                            these costs were a proximate result of defendant's breach and were entitled to be recovered with the principal of the loan and the combined amount trebled pursuant to this section. Quate v. Caudle,

         Deception of Debtor Who Lost Use of Retirement Fund.
        </b> - Practices and actions of credit union in deceiving borrower into thinking that credit union had a valid, enforceable security interest in his retirement account by inserting the word "retirement" in the "other
                            collateral" block on front of loan documents and having debtor sign documents at the time of making his first loan, which authorized the sending of employee's retirement checks to the credit union and depositing therein and
                            the filing away of these forms and applying them to all loans thereafter made violated public policy of protecting the retirement accounts of teachers and other State employees, having the tendency to deceive them regarding
                            their rights as to their retirement accounts and collectively constitute unfair and deceptive trade practices; since debtor was damaged as a result of such practices in that he lost the ability to use his retirement fund for
                            his own needs, including eventual retirement, he was entitled to recover treble damages and attorney's fees. Petersen v. State Employees Credit Union (In re Kittrell), 115 Bankr. 873 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1990).

         Trustee, as Successor in Interest of Debtor's Estate, Could Recover Damages and Fees.
        </b> - Where lending and collection practices of the credit union collectively constituted unfair and deceptive trade practices pursuant to G.S. 75-1.1 and where the credit union willfully engaged in unfair and deceptive
                            trade practices, and that the debtor was deceived and damaged as a result thereof, trustee, as the successor in interest of the debtor's claims against the credit union was therefore entitled to recover treble damages and attorneys'
                            fees pursuant to this section and G.S. 75-16.1 on behalf of the debtor's estate. Petersen v. State Employees Credit Union (In re Kittrell), 115 Bankr. 873 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1990).

         Violation of Federal Copyright Law.

                            Insurance Company Violation Shown as a Matter of Law. - Insurance company which engaged in the act or practice of not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability had become reasonably clear,
                            G.S. 58-63-15(11)(f), also violated G.S. 75-1.1, as a matter of law, without the necessity of an additional showing of frequency indicating a "general business practice," and allegations to that effect sufficiently stated an
                            unfair and deceptive trade practices (UDTP) claim; while insureds' claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and bad faith were barred by the three-year statute of limitations, their UDTP claim was separate and
                            distinct from the claims on the underlying insurance policy, was thus governed by the G.S. 75-16.2 four-year statute of limitations applicable to such claims, and was therefore timely. Page v. Lexington Ins. Co.,

                            Accounting Actions May Have Been Considered Unfair Trade Practices. - Father was hired to provide accounting services to a partnership, and his actions in improperly keeping and maintaining accounting records may have been considered unfair practices
                            in or affecting commerce; further, because the jury found that the father breached a fiduciary duty, not a mere contractual duty, his contention that mere breach of contract was insufficient to show an unfair trade practice
                            was rejected. A treble damages award against the father was proper. White v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 568, 676 S.E.2d 104 (2009), aff'd by <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 47</cite>,

                            in violation of G.S. 75-16, when it allowed a corporation that subsequently declared <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.011.html" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a></cite> bankruptcy to carry a substantial loan balance
                            without any repayment of principal, allowed the corporation to make interest only payments after it became insolvent, allowed the corporation to make late loan payments without accelerating the debt it owed or demanding payment,

                            Because the buyers to a contract with the seller did not possess any contract rights due to the insufficiency of their consideration, they could not allege damages by virtue of any alleged unfair and deceptive acts of the seller relating to that alleged
                            contract; further, because the buyers did not allege that the seller intended to deceive them from the outset, there was no allegation that an unfair or deceptive act by the seller induced the buyers either to pay the deposits
                            mentioned in the alleged option contract or to leave the deposits with the seller's agent rather than withdrawing them. McLamb v. T.P. Inc., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 619 S.E.2d

                            sign a second contract presented a material question as to whether the seller committed an unfair or deceptive act in or affecting commerce; if so, the resulting harm would be that the buyer was subjected to a subsequent purchase

                            Trial court erred by granting a seller summary judgment on a buyer's unfair and deceptive trade practices claim because the buyer established the necessary elements; the fact that the seller adamantly denied the existence of the "original" contract created
                            a material issue of fact, and there also remained the question of whether the buyer reasonably relied on the agent's assertions that the terms of the second contract were identical to those in the "original." Hester v. Hubert

                            the "original" contract and did not read the subsequent contract was not necessarily dispositive; because the UDTP claim did not challenge the enforcement of the subsequent contract, quasi-estoppel did not apply. Hester v.

                            to maintain a UDTP or fraud claim against him; the financing terms in the subsequent contract that the sales person approved were those given to seller. Hester v. Hubert Vester Ford, Inc.,

                            Trial court erred in entering a directed verdict on a homeowner's unfair and deceptive trade practices (UDTP) claim against a contractor because the approach the trial court followed in dismissing the UDTP claim but allowing counsel to argue it in connection
                            with punitive damages was in error; because the jury found in favor of the homeowner on her fraud claim, and the contractor made no attempt to argue that it was exempt from the provisions of G.S. 75-1.1, the homeowner was entitled

                            An action for unfair or deceptive acts or practices is a distinct action apart from fraud, breach of contract, or breach of warranty. Since the remedy was created partly because those remedies often were ineffective, it would be illogical to hold that
                            only those methods of measuring damages could be used. To rule otherwise would produce the anomalous result of recognizing that although G.S. 75-1.1 creates a cause of action broader than traditional common-law actions, this
                            section limits the availability of any remedy to cases where some recovery at common law would probably also lie. Bernard v.

                            caused by the collector's harassing telephone calls when the evidence tended to show that the calls caused the consumer emotional distress; the consumer did not have to show out-of-pocket damages, as that would be inconsistent

                        Under G.S. 75-16.1, an award of attorneys' fees in unfair and deceptive trade practices must take into account the time and labor expended, the skill required, the customary fee for like work, the experience or ability of the attorney, the novelty and
                        difficulty of the questions of law, the adequacy of the representation, the difficulty of the problems faced by the attorney, especially any unusual difficulties, the kind of case for which the fees are sought and the result obtained,
                        and the services expended by paralegals and secretaries acting as paralegals; the same factors are proper guidelines for the trial courts to follow when determining the reasonable value of a discharged attorney's services, which

                        In an action to confirm an arbitration award by a contractor, the trial court properly declined to award attorney fees to property owners under G.S. 75-16.1; the owners resisted arbitration up to and including at the hearing from which the trial court

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees because the trial court found that the plaintiff knew, or should have known, that it would be unable to establish any damages arising from the alleged conduct of the defendant and that
                        the action was frivolous and malicious; furthermore, the appellate court found that the trial court's decision was not manifestly unsupported by reason.

                        Arbitrators' award of attorney fees to plaintiffs under G.S. 75-16.1 was properly confirmed by the trial court; although there was no question that defendants could have argued to the arbitrators that the parties' agreement, together with previous caselaw's
                        application of former G.S. 1-567.11, precluded any award of attorneys' fees, defendants failed to do so and thus waived their right to object. WMS, Inc. v.

                        Trial court's findings, even if supported by the evidence, were not adequate to justify an award of fees under G.S. 75-16.1, because the court's findings did not address either of the grounds for attorneys fees specified in the statute; therefore, the

                        Trial court erred in using the incorrect standard in its order awarding attorney's fees to the prevailing home sellers in the unfair and deceptive practices claim brought by the home buyer because the standard for awarding attorney's fees under G.S. 75-16.1(2)
                        was that the plaintiff knew, or should have known, the action was frivolous and malicious; the trial court instead applied the lower standard of an unwarranted refusal to resolve the case. Thus, remand of the matter to the trial
                        court was necessary for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the award of attorney's fees because the appellate court was unable to determine if the trial court would have awarded attorney's fees if it had

       </b> - Any breach of contract by a trademark licensor first occurred when the third party's interim injunction based on its assertion of a superior registration effectively caused a cessation of performance of the licensor's
                        contractual obligation, which was to continuously provide the trademark for the licensee's use. On comparable reasoning, any claim for fraud or unfair trade practices also accrued no later than the date of the interim injunction.

                        In cases based on allegedly fraudulent conduct or negligent misrepresentation, the cause of action accrues at the time the fraud is discovered or should have been discovered with the exercise of reasonable diligence. Ordinarily, whether a person has exercised
                        due diligence is a question for the jury; however, where the evidence is clear and shows without conflict that the claimant had both the capacity and opportunity to discover the mistake or discrepancy but failed to do so, the absence
                        of reasonable diligence is established as a matter of law. Rich Food Servs., Inc. v. Rich Plan Corp., (E.D.N.C. Nov. 11, 2002).

                        committed by the insurer and the agent in allegedly forging the insured's name on a rejection of UIM coverage form when the insured was denied UIM coverage, (2) the insured signed the policy in 1998, and was injured in a car accident
                        in October 2000, (3) the insured filed suit in November 2005, (4) the insured was first informed that the policy did not include UIM coverage in February 2003, and (5) the insured would not have acquired any contractual right to
                        such coverage if it existed until November 2004, when the insured exhausted the other driver's policy. Piles v. Allstate Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 399, 653 S.E.2d 181 (2007), review

                        which was before the time the consumer filed suit, so the consumer could not show that any violations by the collector of this provision occurred within the statute of limitations. Williams v. HomEq Servicing Corp.,

                        also violated G.S. 75-1.1, as a matter of law, without the necessity of an additional showing of frequency indicating a "general business practice," and allegations to that effect sufficiently stated an unfair and deceptive trade

                        issue in 2007, once the foreclosure process was imminent, which delayed the accrual of the action until 2007 and was within four years of the date the complaint was filed. Trantham v. Michael L. Martin, Inc.,

                        In a suit arising from a seller holdback agreement between a company that was selling a vacant lot for home construction and a bank, which was financing the lot's purchase by a third party, the seller's claim that it was fraudulently induced to enter
                        into the holdback agreement was time-barred under the four-year limitations period under the North Carolina's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act because the seller knew of the fraud more than four years before it filed suit,
                        as evidenced by the fact that prior to the expiration of the limitations period, it sent the bank an e-mail announcing that it planned to sue the bank on the basis that the holdback agreement was a sham. Dreamstreet Invs., Inc.

                        the consumers were called at least 2,200 times in approximately six years, sometimes up to six times a day, and the consumers alleged the callers were rude and abrasive and that the calls were demeaning, and the claim was not barred
                        by the statute of limitations in G.S. 75-16.2 because some calls were made within the period and the earlier calls could be used to prove the later calls. Williams v.

       </b> - For a claimant to claim protection under this Article, he must have had at least some connection with the underlying debt or alleged debt. Because of the presence of the term "incurred" in subdivision (1), the words
                        "alleged debt" could not include an instance in which a debt collector mistakenly identified the person who owed it money or allegedly owed it money. The legislature chose not to use the words "allegedly incurred". Thus, the language
                        of the Article does not evidence an intent by the legislature to provide protection for a person mistakenly thought to have been the one who incurred an obligation. Such persons must rely on common-law remedies. Fisher v. Eastern

                        fee could not be found to be a false representation of a debt owed, under G.S. 75-54(4). Friday v. United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 671, 575 S.E.2d 532 (2003).

                        North Carolina's definition of "debt" is not broad enough to encompass damages sought as a result of tortious or criminal conduct; an alleged thief was simply not a consumer, and damages for allegedly illegal conduct cannot be considered debt within the

                        Assembly contemplated that the protections available under the statute would be available to both those who actually owed the debt and those whom the debt collector claimed to owe the debt even if the debtor denied the existence
                        of the underlying obligation. Green Tree Servicing LLC v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 763 S.E.2d 523 (2014).

                        "Injury." - When consumers alleged that a debt collector violated various statutory provisions of G.S. 75-50 et seq., those claims did not have to be dismissed for a failure to state actual damages because a consumer sufficiently offered evidence of injury
                        proximately caused by the collector's harassing telephone calls when the evidence tended to show that the calls caused the consumer emotional distress; the consumer did not have to show out-of-pocket damages, as that would be inconsistent
                        with G.S. 75-16, providing that a person "injured" as a result of conduct violating Ch. 75 had a right of action on account of such injury done, and if damages were assessed, judgment would be entered for treble the amount fixed
                        by a verdict, so the statute distinguished between "injury" and "damages." Williams v. HomEq Servicing Corp., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 646 S.E.2d 381 (2007).

                        Sufficient Evidence of Harassment. - When consumers alleged that a debt collector violated G.S. 75-52(3) by placing harassing telephone calls to the consumers' residence, it was error to dismiss the claim on summary judgment because the collector's records
                        showed the consumers were called at least 2,200 times in approximately six years, sometimes up to six times a day, and the consumers alleged the callers were rude and abrasive and that the calls were demeaning, and the claim was
                        not barred by the statute of limitations in G.S. 75-16.2 because some calls were made within the period and the earlier calls could be used to prove the later calls. Williams v. HomEq Servicing Corp.,

                        period in G.S. 75-16.2 which was before the time the consumer filed suit, so the consumer could not show that any violations by the collector of this provision occurred within the statute of limitations. Williams v. HomEq Servicing

                        indicate the affiliation between holding company and hospital, and patients argued these written communications led them to believe the matter had been turned over to an independent attorney for collection or the account had been
                        given to an independent third-party collection agency, the vice president's communications did not violate subsection (1) of this section. Forsyth Mem. Hosp. v.

                        Defendants' motion for partial judgment on the pleadings as to the allegations that defendants caused an unknown third party to be served with the complaint and that the defendants prevented the plaintiff from paying the alleged debt was denied because
                        determining whether the defendants' alleged conduct amounted to a fraudulent practice under G.S. 75-54 did not require the court to review or overturn to the state court judgment. Moreover, the issue sought to be precluded was
                        not identical to the one previously litigated because whether the defendants committed fraud or misrepresentation in the process of obtaining a judgment against the plaintiff was a separate issue from whether service was technically
                        proper at the state court level under the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure; the plaintiff was not asking the court to review whether service was proper at the state level. Johnson v. Brock &amp; Scott, PLLC, - F. Supp. 2d

                        S.E.2d 532 (2003).

                        Improper Fees. - When a consumer alleged that a debt collector violated G.S. 75-55(2) by wrongfully imposing various charges, summary judgment dismissing the consumer's claim was properly granted because the improper fees the consumer alleged were either
                        waived or the consumer did not show the fee was not waived, so the consumer did not show the consumer was actually injured since any wrongful imposition of fees was corrected. Williams v. HomEq Servicing Corp.,

                        Unfair Practices. - Although in the area of debt collection, unfair or deceptive acts in commerce are limited to those acts set out in this Article, those specific practices delineated as prohibited are examples of unfair practices within the broader
                        scope of G.S. 75-1.1. Talbert v. Mauney, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 343 S.E.2d 5 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sending notices to a tenant regarding past due rent was a debt collection practice covered by G.S. Ch. 75, Art. 2, and that article exclusively constituted the unfair or deceptive acts or practices proscribed by G.S. 75-1.1 in the area of commerce regulated
                        by the article, under G.S. 75-56, but the notices were not unfair or deceptive trade practices. Friday v. United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 671, 575 S.E.2d 532
                        (2003).

                    <p>
                        Award of an attorney's fee was appropriate for a violation of G.S. Ch. 75, Art. 2 in the same manner as any other part of Ch. 75, and G.S. 75-56 did not limit an award of an attorney's fee as allowed by G.S. 75-16.1, but it was necessary for a trial court
                        to make findings and conclusions to support an award of an attorney's fee. Friday v. United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 671, 575 S.E.2d 532 (2003).

                        Plaintiffs' allegations of wrongful and intentional harm to their credit rating and business prospects occurring less than four years before the filing date of their complaint were of a character clearly meant to be proscribed by the act and were therefore
                        sufficient to state a claim for which relief could be granted under G.S. 75-1.1. Talbert v. Mauney, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 343 S.E.2d 5 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Penalties. - Under G.S. 75-56, for any unfair or deceptive acts or practices proscribed by G.S. 75-1.1 that were covered by G.S. Ch. 75, Art. 2, civil penalties were limited to $2,000 and any damages assessed could not be trebled. Friday v. United Dominion
                        Realty Trust, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 671, 575 S.E.2d 532 (2003).

                        If a conclusion of law was made that a debt collector violated a provision of G.S. Ch. 75, Art. 2, then that violation could be a violation of G.S. 75-1.1; but a debt collector who violated a provision of G.S. Ch. 75, Art. 2 and thereby violated G.S.
                        75-1.1 was only subject to the damages and penalty provided for in G.S. 75-56 and was not subject to the damages provisions in G.S. Ch. 75, Art. 1. Friday v. United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite>                        671, 575 S.E.2d 532 (2003).

                        Bankruptcy court denied creditor's request to strike a treble damages claim from debtors' complaint under the North Carolina Debt Collection Act (NCDCA), finding that the treble damages statute applied not only where damages were awarded under the North
                        Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practice Act but also under the NCDCA, as an earlier specific prohibition against treble damages had been removed from the relevant statute. Creech v. Ormond Oil &amp; Gas Co. (In re Creech),

                        A consumer may place a security freeze on the consumer's credit report by making a request to a consumer reporting agency in accordance with this subsection. A security freeze shall prohibit, subject to exceptions in subsection (l) of this section, the
                        consumer reporting agency from releasing the consumer's credit report or any information from it without the express authorization of the consumer. When a security freeze is in place, a consumer reporting agency may not release
                        the consumer's credit report or information to a third party without prior express authorization from the consumer. This subsection does not prevent a consumer reporting agency from advising a third party that a security freeze
                        is in effect with respect to the consumer's credit report, provided that the consumer reporting agency does not state or otherwise imply to the third party that the consumer's security freeze reflects a negative credit score, history,
                        report, or rating. A consumer reporting agency shall place a security freeze on a consumer's credit report if the consumer requests a security freeze by any of the following methods:

                </p>
                <p>
                    You have a right to place a "security freeze" on your credit report pursuant to North Carolina law. The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your credit report without your express authorization.
                    A security freeze can be requested in writing by first-class mail, by telephone, or electronically. You also may request a freeze by visiting the following Web site: [URL] or calling the following telephone number: [NUMBER].
                </p>
                <p>
                    The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gains access to the personal and financial
                    information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding new loans, credit, mortgage, insurance, rental housing, employment, investment,
                    license, cellular phone, utilities, digital signature, Internet credit card transactions, or other services, including an extension of credit at point of sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The freeze will be placed within three business days if you request it by mail, or within 24 hours if you request it by telephone or electronically. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, within three business days, you will be sent a
                    personal identification number or a password to use when you want to remove the security freeze, temporarily lift it, or lift it with respect to a particular third party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A freeze does not apply when you have an existing account relationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of account review, collection, fraud control, or similar activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should plan ahead and lift a freeze if you are actively seeking credit or services as a security freeze may slow your applications, as mentioned above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can remove a freeze, temporarily lift a freeze, or lift a freeze with respect to a particular third party by contacting the consumer reporting agency and providing all of the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from you to temporarily lift a freeze or to lift a freeze with respect to a particular third party on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the
                    request by mail and no later than 15 minutes after receiving a request by telephone or electronically. A consumer reporting agency may charge you up to three dollars ($3.00) to institute a freeze if your request is made by telephone
                    or by mail. A consumer reporting agency may not charge you any amount to freeze, remove a freeze, temporarily lift a freeze, or lift a freeze with respect to a particular third party, if any of the following are true:
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1) Your request is made electronically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) You are over the age of 62.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) You are the victim of identity theft and have submitted a copy of a valid investigative or incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency about the unlawful use of your identifying information by another person, or you are the spouse of
                    such a person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have a right to bring a civil action against someone who violates your rights under the credit reporting laws. The action can be brought against a consumer reporting agency or a user of your credit report."

                        The use of the telephone to market goods and services to the home is now pervasive due to the increased use of cost-effective telephone solicitation technologies and techniques.

                    <li id="t75a04s75-100ol12">
                        While some consumers enjoy and benefit from telephone solicitations from legitimate telephone solicitors, many others object to these telephone solicitations as an intrusive invasion of their privacy in the home.

                        In addition, the proliferation of telephone solicitations, especially during the evening hours, creates a nuisance and a disturbance upon the home and family life of telephone subscribers during a time of day used by many families for traditional family

                        Individual privacy rights, personal safety, prevention of fraud, and commercial freedom of speech and trade must be balanced in a way that protects the privacy of individuals and permits legitimate telephone solicitation practices.

                        Legitimate telephone solicitors have no interest in continuing to invade the privacy of those telephone subscribers who affirmatively express their desires to receive no further telephone solicitations.

                        Many telephone subscribers who have transacted business with firms that employ telephone solicitations have experienced problems with their checking and credit card accounts being debited before they can evaluate the terms and conditions of the transaction,
                        before they can evaluate the merchandise or service to be delivered, or without their agreement to enter into the transaction or authorize such transactions in the first place. Other telephone subscribers have had unauthorized
                        charges placed on their telephone bill and have had their long-distance carrier switched without their authorization as a result of telephone solicitations.

                        New technologies that make telephone solicitations more cost-effective also allow for the creation of a "Do Not Call" Registry through which North Carolina consumers can easily register their desires not to receive further telephone solicitations and
                        telephone solicitors can easily access and employ lists of consumers who have registered those desires.

                <p>
                    A violation of G.S. 75-121 is an unfair trade practice under G.S. 75-1.1. A homeowner may bring an action for the recovery of damages, to void a prohibited foreclosure rescue transaction, as well as for declaratory or equitable relief for a violation
                    of this Article. The provisions of this section shall not be enforceable against a bona fide purchaser for value. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative to, and not a limitation of, any other rights and remedies provided
                    by law or equity. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to subject an individual homeowner selling his or her primary residence to liability under G.S. 75-1.1.

                                North Carolina is home to a growing high-technology, knowledge-based economy. With its top-tier research universities and active technology sector, North Carolina is poised to continue its growth. To continue growing, North Carolina must attract new,
                                small, and mid-sized technology companies. Doing so will help provide jobs for North Carolina's residents and boost North Carolina's economy. North Carolina also is home to companies in retail, manufacturing, and other
                                industries, many of whom are customers of technology companies. Those other businesses are more likely to succeed if not inhibited by abusive and bad-faith demands and litigation.

                            <li id="t75a08s75-141ol1a2">
                                Patents encourage research, development, and innovation. Patent holders have legitimate rights to enforce their patents.
                            </li>
                            <li id="t75a08s75-141ol1a3">
                                The General Assembly does not wish to interfere with good-faith patent litigation or the good-faith enforcement of patents. The General Assembly also recognizes that North Carolina is preempted from passing any law that conflicts with federal patent law.
                            </li>
                            <li id="t75a08s75-141ol1a4">
                                Patent litigation can be technical, complex, and expensive. The expense of patent litigation, which may cost millions of dollars, can be a significant burden on companies. North Carolina wishes to help its businesses avoid these costs by encouraging the
                                most efficient resolution of patent infringement claims without conflicting with federal law.
                            </li>

                                In order for North Carolina companies to be able to respond promptly and efficiently to patent infringement assertions against them, it is necessary that they receive specific information regarding how their product, service, or technology may have infringed
                                the patent at issue. Receiving this information at an early stage will facilitate the resolution of claims and lessen the burden of potential litigation on North Carolina companies.
                            </li>
                            <li id="t75a08s75-141ol1a6">
                                Abusive patent litigation, and especially the assertion of bad-faith infringement claims, can harm North Carolina companies. A business that receives a letter asserting such claims faces the threat of expensive and protracted litigation and may feel that
                                it has no choice but to settle and to pay a licensing fee even if the claim is meritless. This is especially so for small- and medium-sized companies and nonprofits that lack the resources to investigate and defend themselves
                                against infringement claims.
                            </li>

                                Not only do bad-faith patent infringement claims impose a significant burden on individual North Carolina businesses, they also undermine North Carolina's efforts to attract and nurture technology and other companies. Funds used to avoid the threat of
                                bad-faith litigation are no longer available to invest, produce new products, expand, or hire new workers, thereby harming North Carolina's economy.
                            </li>
                            <li id="t75a08s75-141ol1a8">
                                North Carolina has a strong interest in patent matters involving its citizens and its businesses, including protecting its citizens and businesses against abusive patent assertions and ensuring North Carolina companies are not subjected to abusive patent
                                assertion by entities acting in bad faith.
                            </li>

                                In lawsuits involving abusive patent assertions, an accused infringer prevailing on the merits may be awarded costs and, less frequently, fees. These awards do not serve as a deterrent to abusive patent assertion entities who have limited liability, as
                                these companies may hold no cash or other assets. North Carolina has a strong interest in making sure that prevailing North Carolina companies sued by abusive patent assertions entities can recover what is awarded to them.

                        The General Assembly seeks, by this narrowly tailored act, to strike a balance between (i) the interests of efficient and prompt resolution of patent infringement claims, protection of North Carolina businesses from abusive and bad-faith assertions of
                        patent infringement, and building of North Carolina's economy and (ii) the intentions to respect federal law and be careful to not interfere with legitimate patent enforcement actions. Except as specifically set forth in this act
                        regarding bad-faith patent assertions, nothing in this act is intended to alter current law concerning piercing the corporate veil or otherwise concerning personal liability of principals in business entities.
