            by a contractor to a subcontractor is not a condition precedent for payment to any other subcontractor, and an agreement to the contrary is unenforceable.

        <p>
            Timing of Payment to Subcontractor. - G.S. 22C-3 addresses only the issue of what is to be done when the general contractor has already been paid, but says nothing about what happens when the owner does not pay; in effect, it sets an outer boundary for
            payment to the subcontractor of seven days after the general contractor has been paid, but it does not eliminate the possibility that the subcontractor may be entitled to payment earlier than that. If the legislature had intended to overturn
            the rule established by Howard-Green Elec. Co. v. Chaney &amp; James Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 182 S.E.2d 601 (1971), it would have done so in unmistakable language. Statesville Roofing &amp; Heating

            Illegal "Pay When Paid" Provision Was Severable and Did Not Defeat Notice of Delay Provision. - Although the "pay when paid" clause of a contract was unenforceable, it was severable from the rest of the contract and did not defeat the notice of delay
            provision, which was not dependent on the illegal provision; thus, summary judgment was affirmed in favor of a general contractor in a case brought by a subcontractor claiming damages from a delay caused by a general contractor where the subcontractor
            failed to comply with contractual notice of delay time requirements. Am. Nat'l Elec. Corp. v. Poythress Commer. Contrs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 97, 604 S.E.2d 315 (2004).
