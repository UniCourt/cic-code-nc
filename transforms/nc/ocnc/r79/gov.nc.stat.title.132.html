            Although documents under the definition of "public records" of G.S. 132-1(a) of the Public Records Act, G.S. 132-1 et seq., were usually subject to disclosure, an exemption existed for public hospital personnel files under the clear and unambiguous language
            of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131E.html#t131Ea15As131E-257.2" target="_blank">G.S. 131E-257.2</a></cite> of the Public Hospital Personnel Act, and "personnel files" was defined broadly in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131E.html#t131Ea15As131E-257.2" target="_blank">G.S. 131E-257.2</a></cite>(a);
            the interpretation of what information was to be disclosed from those files was based on statutory history, including changes made from predecessor language, as well as the legislature's intent to carve out a privacy niche for public hospital

            director's job and discussed the employee's interaction with the board regarding the board's decision-making process, the fact that the county manager chose to place the letter in the employee's personnel file had no bearing on whether the

            employee, as the information had to relate to an illustrative list of subjects arising out of the employment, and there was no basis for considering these parts of the letter to be "any information" gathered by the county "with respect to"

            Automated Criminal/Infraction System (ACIS) database was subject to public disclosure because it fell squarely within the definition of a public record as an electronic data-processing record; once the clerks of court entered information from their criminal

            reviewing the unredacted minutes, the appellate court concluded that the undisclosed portions were properly redacted by the trial court, except that the trial court correctly found that the minutes concerning a policy issue had to be disclosed

            Trial court did not err in holding that the records the newspaper sought, with limited exceptions, were public records that had to be made available by the town for public inspection and copying; the town could not assert that because the town attorneys,
            and not the town itself, possessed the records that the records were not public records, as the town attorneys were an agency or subdivision of the town, were public officers, and a ruling otherwise would mean that a town could give records
            to its town attorneys to shield what otherwise would be public records from disclosure. Womack Newspapers, Inc. v. Town of Kitty Hawk, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 639 S.E.2d 96 (2007).

            This Chapter Compared with the Open Meetings Law. - The Public Records Act (G.S. 132-1 et seq.) and the Open Meetings Law (G.S. 143-318.10) are discrete statutes, each designed to promote in a different way openness in government. There is no suggestion
            in either statute that an agency not subject to one is, ipso facto, exempt from the other. News &amp; Observer Publishing Co. v. Poole, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 465</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 7 (1992).
            <br />

            The Public Records Law may apply to minutes from meetings of an agency exempt from the Open Meetings Law. News &amp; Observer Publishing Co. v. Poole, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 465</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 7 (1992).

            Open Courts Provision. - This statute only prohibits a court from restricting the publication of reports regarding matter presented "in open court"; thus, although court records may generally be public records under this section, a trial court may shield
            portions of court proceedings and records from public view subject to statutory and constitutional limitation. Virmani v. Presbyterian Health Servs. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 629, 493 S.E.2d 310 (1997),

            Balance of Competing Interests. - In deciding whether to close court proceedings or seal court records, a court must balance the competing interests and policies at stake in light of the particular circumstances of the case but must give substantial weight
            to the presumption of open access. Virmani v. Presbyterian Health Servs. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 629, 493 S.E.2d 310 (1997), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 449</cite>,

            Judicial Application of Exception in Former G.S. 143-318.11(d). - Courts should ensure that the exception in former subsection (d) of G.S. 143-318.11 to the disclosure requirement should extend no further than necessary to protect ongoing efforts of a

            and were not subject to inspection because the documents contained mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of city attorneys or other agents of the city in reasonable anticipation of litigation; at the hearing to compel
            production of public records, the city argued that the materials withheld all related to its research and its taking a look at legal strategies related to possible zoning enforcement, not with respect to any of the claims that the landowner
            suggested they could pursue against the city with respect to an administrative inspection. Wallace Farm, Inc. v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 689 S.E.2d 922, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 334</cite>,

            Work Product of Local Government Attorney not Protected from Disclosure - Language of G.S. 132-1(b) has been interpreted to only recognize an exception to the North Carolina Public Records Act in the face of a clear statutory exemption or exception to
            the Public Records Act; in other words, the Public Records Act grants public access to documents it defines as "public records," absent a specific statutory exemption. Therefore, because there was no statute specifically exempting from public
            access materials held by a local government attorney that qualified as work product, a city attorney's documents were not protected from disclosure as work product. McCormick v.

            Standing alone, a postsecondary educational institution possesses discretion to disclose, but when such a postsecondary educational institution is public, operating as an undisputed agency of North Carolina under the Public Records Act and therefore subject

            Conflict preemption did not exist in the present case because compliance with both the Public Records Act and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act was possible, and the Public Records Act does not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution

            Disclosure of Settlement Documents. - Settlement documents in an action brought by a state agency were not exempt from disclosure under G.S. 132-1.3 because the statute had to be construed consistently with statutes giving public access to attorney communications
            on settlements and disclosure under G.S. 143-318.11(a)(3). Jackson v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 768 S.E.2d 23 (2014).

            Limited attorney-client privilege - Statutory protection for privileged information is more narrow than the traditional common law attorney-client privilege. According to G.S. 132-1.1(a), the North Carolina Public Records Act provides only one exception
            (based on privilege) to its mandate of public access to public records: written statements to a public agency, by any attorney serving the government agency, made within the scope of the attorney-client privilege, and involving a claim, defense,
            settlement, litigation, or administrative proceeding. McCormick v. Hanson Aggregates Southeast, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 596 S.E.2d 431 (2004).

            Public Utilities as Private Persons. - Telephone service providers were "private persons" under this section for purposes of their claim that information filed with an agency constituted "trade secrets," even though providers were public utilities subject
            to fair regulation, since such regulation was not comprehensive and did not overshadow independent authority exercised by providers over operation of their own businesses. State ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. MCI Telecommunications Corp.,

        <p>
            Settlement documents in an action brought by a state agency were not exempt from disclosure under G.S. 132-1.3 because subsequently enacted <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.114.html#t114a01s114-2.4" target="_blank">G.S. 114-2.4</a></cite>A

        <p>
            Settlement documents in an action brought by a state agency were not exempt from disclosure under G.S. 132-1.3 because the statute had to be construed consistently with statutes giving public access to attorney communications on settlements and disclosure
            under G.S. 143-318.11(a)(3). Jackson v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 768 S.E.2d 23 (2014).

     Settlement Resulting from Investigation of Sheriff
    </b> - A conciliation agreement between an EEOC claimant and a county board of commissioners, resulting from an investigation of the sheriff and involving the appropriation of over $21,000.00, should be made available to the public. See
            opinion of Attorney General Mr. Charles L. Revelle, III, Assistant Hertford County Attorney, 1998 N.C.A.G. 14 (3/4/98).

            <b>
     Settlement Agreement Not Confidential.
    </b> - Only medical malpractice settlements in which the State is a party are exempt from disclosure; a settlement agreement, not involving medical malpractice, between a doctor and a State hospital, even one purporting to keep the settlement
            or related matters confidential, must be released to the requestor in its unredacted form, with the exception of information from the doctor's personnel file which was first gathered by the hospital. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr.
            Fred M. Carmichael Summrell, Sugg, Carmichael &amp; Ashton, P.A., 1997 N.C.A.G. 68 (11/26/97).

        <p>
            City attorney's office qualifies as public law enforcement agency - As the City Attorney's Office for the City of Raleigh was responsible for investigating, preventing, and solving zoning violations, it qualified as a "public law enforcement agency" under
            G.S. 132- 1.4(b)(3); any organizational unit within a county or city that is responsible for enforcement of a statute, ordinance, or regulation that carries misdemeanor or infraction penalties is capable of generating records that are covered

            University Campus Police. - Dismissal of the suit under the North Carolina Public Records Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 132, was proper, because the university campus police department was not subject to the Act, when campus police departments were not enumerated
            in the list of departments and agencies qualifying as a public law enforcement agency, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.074G.html#t74Gs74G-5ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 74G-5(a)</a></cite> did not specifically charge

            Continuing Investigation - Trial court ordered certain records withheld by a city attorney on the basis of G.S. 132-1.4 be produced because the statute of limitations for prosecuting a misdemeanor had expired. On appeal, the court agreed with the city
            attorney that the trial court erred in adopting a straight-line rule through the application of two-year statute of limitations for misdemeanors; in light of the broad scope and purposes behind the criminal investigation exception, the trial
            court should have conducted an in camera review, as requested by the city attorney, to properly determine, based on the purpose in compiling each withheld document and the definitions for "records of criminal investigations" and "records of
            criminal intelligence information" found in G.S. 132-1.4(b)(1)-(2), whether the material was subject to the exception. McCormick v. Hanson Aggregates Southeast, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 596 S.E.2d 431

        <p>
            Discretionary Disclosure of Non-public Records. - G.S. 132-1.4(a) grants the trial court the discretion to disclose documents that do not qualify as public records under G.S. 132-1.4 if they could be obtained by defendant pursuant to the normal rules
            of discovery. McCormick v. Hanson Aggregates Southeast, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 596 S.E.2d 431 (2004).

        <p>
            A public record, as defined by G.S. 132-1, does not include any registration or sensitive security information received or compiled by a city pursuant to an alarm registration ordinance. For purposes of this section, the term "alarm registration ordinance"
            means an ordinance adopted by a city that requires owners of security, burglar, fire, or similar alarm systems to register with the city. Information that is deemed confidential under this section and is not open to public inspection, examination,
            or copying includes registration information, including the name, home and business telephone number, and any other personal identifying information provided by an applicant pursuant to an alarm registration ordinance, and any sensitive security
            information pertaining to an applicant's alarm system, including residential or office blueprints, alarm system schematics, and similar drawings or diagrams.

            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that documents a city withheld from a landowner were trial preparation materials under the North Carolina Public Records Act, G.S. 132-1.9(b), and were not subject to inspection because the documents
            contained mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of city attorneys or other agents of the city in reasonable anticipation of litigation; at the hearing to compel production of public records, the city argued that the
            materials withheld all related to its research and its taking a look at legal strategies related to possible zoning enforcement, not with respect to any of the claims that the landowner suggested they could pursue against the city with respect
            to an administrative inspection. Wallace Farm, Inc. v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 689 S.E.2d 922, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 334</cite>, 701 S.E.2d 681, 2010 N.C. LEXIS

            Custodian Must Be Sued In Official Capacity. - G.S. 132-6(a) provides that a custodian of public records has a statutory duty to permit reasonable inspection of those records by the public. In order to compel an unresponsive custodian to fulfill this

        </h3>
        <p>
            Geographical information systems databases and data files developed and operated by counties and cities are public records within the meaning of this Chapter. The county or city shall provide public access to such systems by public access terminals or
            other output devices. Upon request, the county or city shall furnish copies, in documentary or electronic form, to anyone requesting them at reasonable cost. As a condition of furnishing an electronic copy, whether on magnetic tape, magnetic
            disk, compact disk, or photo-optical device, a county or city may require that the person obtaining the copy agree in writing that the copy will not be resold or otherwise used for trade or commercial purposes. For purposes of this section,
            publication or broadcast by the news media, real estate trade associations, or Multiple Listing Services operated by real estate trade associations shall not constitute a resale or use of the data for trade or commercial purposes and use of
            information without resale by a licensed professional in the course of practicing the professional's profession shall not constitute use for a commercial purpose. For purposes of this section, resale at cost by a real estate trade association
            or Multiple Listing Services operated by a real estate trade association shall not constitute a resale or use of the data for trade or commercial purposes.
