                organized unlawful activity by any person or association of persons whether natural, incorporated or unincorporated in this State; and to provide compensation to private persons injured by organized unlawful activity. It is not the intent

        </h4>
        <p>
            This section is a civil in rem proceeding. State ex rel. Thornburg v. Tavern &amp; Other Bldgs. &amp; Lots at 1907 N. Main St., <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 384 S.E.2d 585 (1989).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Payment of Proceeds from Sale of Forfeited Property. - Since the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides that the proceeds from the sale of RICO forfeited property accrue to the State, such proceeds must therefore be paid to
            the public school fund as required by N.C. Const., Art. IX,
            <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 7. State ex rel. Thornburg v. 532 "B" Street, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 290</cite>, 432 S.E.2d 684 (1993).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Priority of Controlled Substances Act Provisions. - The criminal forfeiture provisions of the Controlled Substances Act take precedence over the civil forfeiture provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) where the possessor
            of the items seized and subject to forfeiture has been validly indicted and awaits criminal trial under the Controlled Substances Act. State ex rel. Thornburg v. Currency in Amount of $52,029.00, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 276</cite>,
            378 S.E.2d 1 (1989).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            State's Title Superior Where Intervenor's Interest Derived from Deed Recorded After Filing of Lis Pendens. - Since State's title to property, derived from a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act forfeiture proceeding, related back
            to the date of the institution of the action when the notice of lis pendens was filed pursuant to subdivision (
            <i>
    l
   </i> )(1)(a) of this section, the State's title was superior to the interest of an intervenor which derived from a deed from her husband recorded after the institution of the RICO action, and after the filing of the notice of lis pendens.
            State ex rel. Thornburg v. Tavern &amp; Other Bldgs. &amp; Lots at 1907 N. Main St., <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 384 S.E.2d 585 (1989).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            "Innocent Party" Issue Raised by Intervenor. - Nothing in this chapter requires State to make any person a party defendant or to allege or prove that any person claiming an interest in the property is "innocent" to effect forfeiture; the only way, therefore,
            that an "innocent party" issue will be raised is by the voluntary intervention of some claimant to the property. State ex rel. Thornburg v. Tavern &amp; Other Bldgs. &amp; Lots at 1907 N. Main St., <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite>            84, 384 S.E.2d 585 (1989).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Intervenors Claiming to Be Innocent Parties Have Burden of Proof on That Issue. - The burden of proof of any exemption or exception is normally upon the person claiming it, and the General Assembly has clearly indicated by the provisions of this section
            that intervenors claiming to be innocent parties have the burden of proof on that issue. State ex rel. Thornburg v. Tavern &amp; Other Bldgs. &amp; Lots at 1907 N. Main St., <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 384 S.E.2d
            585 (1989).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Evidence. - There was ample evidence to show that defendant's property was used in the course of a racketeering activity where the State's forecast of evidence revealed that each incident of criminal conduct took place on the real property for which forfeiture
            was sought, where also included in the State's evidence were affidavits of law enforcement officers showing without question that such property was used to further defendant's criminal activity, and where at the hearing before the trial court,
            the defendant made no effort to rebut or contest the State's evidence. State ex rel. Thornburg v. Lot &amp; Bldgs. at 800 Waughtown St., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 421 S.E.2d 374, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 170</cite>,
            424 S.E.2d 915 (1992).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Pattern of Racketeering Activity. - Where the defendant engaged in at least two incidents of racketeering activity that had the same or similar purposes and methods of commission and at least one incident occurred within a four-year period of the other,
            two of defendant's gambling convictions alone would constitute a "pattern of racketeering activity" under this Act. State ex rel. Thornburg v. Lot &amp; Bldgs. at 800 Waughtown St., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 559,
            421 S.E.2d 374, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 170</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 915 (1992).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Property Used in Furtherance of Unlawful Activity. - Where the evidence adduced at trial clearly showed that defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity and that certain of his property was used in furtherance of such unlawful activity, the
            defendant's property was subject to forfeiture. State ex rel. Thornburg v. Lot &amp; Bldgs. at 800 Waughtown St., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 421 S.E.2d 374, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 170</cite>,

            Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person or enterprise may have information or may be in possession, custody or control of any documentary materials relevant to an activity prohibited under G.S. 75D-4, he may issue in writing,
            and cause to be served upon such person or upon the appropriate officers, agents, and employees of any such enterprise (other than one employed as an attorney by such person or enterprise), a notice requiring such person or enterprise to submit
            themselves to examination by him, and produce for his inspection any documentary material relevant to an investigation of activities prohibited by G.S. 75D-4.
        </p>
        <p>
            The notice shall be served either personally or by registered or certified mail return receipt requested. The notice shall specify the general purpose of the examination, a general description of the documentary material to be produced, and the time and
            place where such examination will take place. The witness shall be placed under oath or affirmation to testify truthfully. The examination shall be recorded and the witness has the right to a copy upon payment of its cost. The witness has
            the right to have legal counsel present during the examination.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Attorney General shall also have the right to apply to any judge of the superior court division, after five days' prior notice of such application served in the same manner as the notice of examination described in this section, for an order requiring
            such person or enterprise to appear and subject himself or itself to examination, and disobedience of such order shall constitute contempt, and shall be punishable as in other cases of disobedience of a proper order of such court.
        </p>

            No such demand or order of a court shall contain any requirement which would be held to be unreasonable if contained in a civil discovery request or court order issued pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rules of Civil Procedure 26-36. Any person or enterprise upon
            whom a demand is served and who objects to complying with such demand in whole or in part, shall, within five days of service of the demand, serve a written reply upon the Attorney General specifying the nature of the objection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such examination shall be held in camera and no one, except the person or enterprise being examined, may release information obtained from the examination prior to a proceeding being instituted under this Chapter by the Attorney General. Such information
            may be used in any proceeding instituted under this Chapter by the Attorney General. Any person violating the provisions of this paragraph shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. If such offending person is a public officer or employee,
            he shall also be dismissed from such office or employment and shall not hold any public office or employment in this State for a period of five years after conviction. This paragraph does not prohibit disclosure of this information to other
