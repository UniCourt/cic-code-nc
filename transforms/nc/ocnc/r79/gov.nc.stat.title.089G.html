                Every license issued under this Chapter shall be renewed on or before December 31 of each year. Any person who desires to continue to practice irrigation contracting or irrigation construction shall apply for license renewal and shall submit the required
                fees. Licenses that are not renewed shall be automatically revoked. A license may be renewed at any time within one year after its expiration, if: (i) the applicant pays the required renewal fee and late renewal fee; (ii) the Board finds
                that the applicant has not used the license in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter or engaged in the practice of irrigation construction or irrigation contracting after notice of revocation; and (iii) the applicant
                is otherwise eligible for licensure under the provisions of this Chapter. When necessary, the Board may require a licensee to demonstrate continued competence as a condition of license renewal.

            <li id="t89Gs89G-9ol1b">
                As a condition of license renewal, an individual licensee shall meet continuing education requirements set by the Board. Each individual licensee shall complete 10 continuing education units per year.
            </li>
            <li id="t89Gs89G-9ol1c">
                The Board shall suspend an individual licensee's license for 60 days for failure to obtain continuing education units required by subsection (b) of this section. The Board shall suspend a business entity's or a foreign entity's license for 60 days for
                failure by the individual licensee required under G.S. 89G-6.1(a) to obtain continuing education units required by subsection (b) of this section. Upon completion of the required continuing education and payment of the reinstatement fee,
                the Board shall reinstate the license. Failure by an individual licensee to meet the education requirements, to request a reinstatement of the license, or to pay the reinstatement fee within the time provided shall result in the revocation
                of the license. Upon revocation, an individual shall be required to submit a new application and retake the examination as provided in this Chapter.
