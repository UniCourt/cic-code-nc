                    Editor's Note. - Session Laws 1985 (Reg. Sess., 1986), c. 989, s. 2 enacted a new Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as Article 5 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.059.html" target="_blank">Chapter 59</a></cite>,
                    and repealed this Article, effective October 1, 1986. Limited partnerships created after October 1, 1986, are governed by Article 5 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.059.html" target="_blank">Chapter 59</a></cite>. As
                    to the effective date and applicability of various provisions of the new Article and of this Article to transactions entered into and partnerships formed before October 1, 1986, see G.S. 59-1104.

                <p>
                    Section 1 of Session Laws 1985 (Reg. Sess., 1986), c. 989 added a new G.S. 59-30.1 to repealed Article 1, reading as follows: "G.S. 59-30.1. No limited partnership shall be formed under this Article after September 30, 1986."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 31 of the act from which the repealed Article was codified repealed G.S. 3258-3276 of the Consolidated Statutes, as amended, except insofar as said sections affected limited partnerships existing on March 15, 1941, when the Article became effective.

      </b> - Session Laws 2001-358, s. 53, provided that the act, which amended this section, was effective October 1, 2001, and applicable to documents submitted for filing on or after that date. Section 173 of Session Laws 2001-387
                    changed the effective date of Session Laws 2001-358 from October 1, 2001, to January 1, 2002. Section 6 of Session Laws 2001-413, effective September 14, 2001, added a sentence to s. 175(a) of Session Laws 2001-387, making s. 173 of
                    that act effective when it became law (August 26, 2001). As a result of these changes, the amendment by Session Laws 2001-358 is effective January 1, 2002, and applicable to documents submitted for filing on or after that date.

                        "Profit" Relates to Purpose of Business. - There was no merit to defendant's contention that since he and his associates never achieved a "profit" in their business dealings, there could be no partnership, since the word "profit," as it is used in subsection
                        (a) of this section, relates to the purpose of the business, not to whether the business actually produced a net gain. Reddington v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 236, 262 S.E.2d 841

                        Partnership is a legal concept but the determination of the existence or not of a partnership, as in the case of a trust, involves inferences drawn from an analysis of "all the circumstances attendant on its creation and operation." Peed v. Peed,

                        To make a partnership, two or more persons should combine their property, effects, labor, or skill in a common business or venture, under an agreement to share the profits and losses in equal or specified proportions, constituting each member an agent

                        A voluntary association of partners may be shown without proving an express agreement to form a partnership; and a finding of its existence may be based upon a rational consideration of the acts and declarations of the parties, warranting the inference
                        that the parties understood that they were partners and acted as such. Peed v. Peed, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 549, 325 S.E.2d 275, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 604</cite>,

                        document set forth in detail the proposed terms of the business relationship, and the parties subsequently complied with the proposed terms contained in the document. Wiggs v.

                        Creation by Express or Implied Agreement or Conduct. - Not only may a partnership be formed orally, but it may be created by the agreement or conduct of the parties, either express or implied. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite>                        25, 293 S.E.2d 268, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 127</cite>, 297 S.E.2d 399 (1982).

                        Express Agreement Not Required. - A voluntary association of partners may be shown without proving an express agreement to form a partnership; and a finding of its existence may be based upon a rational consideration of the acts and declarations of the
                        parties, warranting the inference that the parties understood that they were partners and acted as such. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 293 S.E.2d 268, cert. denied,

                        Existence of a partnership does not require an express agreement and the parties' intent to formulate a partnership can be inferred by the conduct of the parties by examining all the circumstances. Wilder v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite>                        199, 398 S.E.2d 625 (1990).

                        There is no requirement for an express agreement, either written or oral, in order to form a partnership; rather, a partnership may be created by the conduct and declarations of the principals without an express agreement of any kind. Magers v. Thomas

                    <p>
                        A partnership agreement may be inferred without a written or oral contract if the conduct of the parties toward each other is such that such an inference is justified.

        The intent to realize a profit is an indicia of partnership

                    <p>
                        Co-ownership and sharing of any actual profits are indispensable requisites for a partnership. Wilder v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 199, 398 S.E.2d 625 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Sharing Profits. - Although sharing profits does not of itself establish a partnership, the Uniform Partnership Act emphasizes the importance of sharing profits in the existence of a partnership by mandating that the receipt by a person of a share of
                        the business profits is prima facie evidence that he is a partner. Wilder v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 199, 398 S.E.2d 625 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Agreement to Share Profits Does Not Necessarily Create Partnership. - While an agreement to share profits, as such, is one of the tests of a partnership, an agreement to receive part of the profits for his services and attention, as a means only of ascertaining
                        the compensation, does not create a partnership. Johnson v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 40</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 788 (1952).

                        The determination of whether a partnership exists, and whether the parties are co-owners, involves examining all the circumstances. Peed v. Peed, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 549, 325 S.E.2d 275, cert. denied,

                        Receipt of Share of Profits Is Prima Facie Evidence of Partnership. - Where defendant's corporation, and not defendant, received a direct share of plaintiff partnership's profits, that was prima facie evidence that defendant's corporation, not defendant,
                        was a partner. Sturm v. Goss, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 326, 368 S.E.2d 399 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Inferences from Circumstances of Creation and Operation. - Partnership is a legal concept but the determination of the existence or not of a partnership, as in the case of a trust, involves inferences drawn from an analysis of all the circumstances attendant
                        on its creation and operation. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 293 S.E.2d 268, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 127</cite>, 297 S.E.2d 399 (1982).

                        The filing of a partnership tax return is significant evidence of a partnership. Sturm v. Goss, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 326, 368 S.E.2d 399 (1988); Wilder v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite>                        199, 398 S.E.2d 625 (1990).

                    <p>
                        The filing of partnership tax returns is "significant" evidence of the existence of a partnership and may constitute an admission against interest by a party who denies the existence of a partnership after having signed a partnership return. Magers v.

                    <p>
                        Failure to Show Partnership. - Where plaintiffs, who filed an action to enjoin foreclosure on real property, contending that the option contract, contract to purchase and note entered into between plaintiffs and defendants created a partnership relationship
                        rather than a mortgagee-mortgagor relationship, failed to show probable cause to believe that they would be able to establish the partnership rights they asserted, the trial court did not err in denying a preliminary injunction
                        and allowing foreclosure to proceed. Carefree Carolina Communities, Inc. v. Cilley, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 742, 340 S.E.2d 529, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 374</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Where a plaintiff contended that a joint venture agreement established all the elements of a partnership with a <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.011.html" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a></cite> debtor, the agreement,
                        standing alone, did not prove the existence of a partnership because it did not establish both co-ownership and the sharing of profits. Anderson v. Brokers Inc. (In re Brokers, Inc.), 363 B.R. 458 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2007).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Sale or Lease of Property to Partnership. - Where a tractor was either sold by an individual to a partnership for "ten hundred dollars," payable one hundred dollars per week, or was leased to the partnership on a rental basis of one hundred dollars per
                        week, even though it appeared that the money paid for the tractor was money received from the partnership business, no inference arose therefrom that the individual was a partner in the business. Johnson v. Gill,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">235 N.C. 40</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 788 (1952).

                    <p>
                        Instruction as to Statutory Rules. - The trial court's instructions on the law applicable to the formation of partnerships were inadequate where the court did not give the jury the benefit of the applicable statutory rules for determining the existence
                        of a partnership that are set out in this section. Hardesty v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 260 S.E.2d 925 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Partnership Shown. - Evidence was sufficient to show the existence of a partnership where letters detailed the duties of the plaintiff, the plaintiff testified that the parties agreed to share profits of their venture, and the defendants failed to show
                        that the plaintiff's claim was legally deficient. Dean v. Manus Homes, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 549, 546 S.E.2d 160 (2001).
                    </p>

        Determination of Partnership Property.
       </b> - An important factor in determining whether property listed in the names of the partners is partnership property is whether the property is used by those partners for partnership purposes; if so, such use of the property
                        is evidence of an intention that the property be partnership property. Magers v. Thomas (In re Vannoy), 176 Bankr. 758 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1994).

        Where a partnership is formed and operated around a single asset for a period of years,
       </b> courts should be reluctant to permit the partners to separate that asset from the partnership, particularly after the occurrence of a transaction or event giving rise to a legal controversy and particularly on the basis
                        of after-the-fact testimony regarding their subjective intentions. Magers v. Thomas (In re Vannoy), 176 Bankr. 758 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1994).

                        that they could pursue the business venture which they were pursuing as partners, the property thereby was brought into the partnership and was "partnership property" under the definition contained in subparagraph (a). Magers v.

                        Service of Summons on One Partner. - Under the Uniform Partnership Act it is not necessary that all members of an alleged partnership should be served with summons. A partnership is represented by the partner who is served, and as to him a judgment in
                        the action in which he is served would be binding on him individually, and as to the partnership property. But as to a partner not served with summons, the judgment would not be binding on him individually. Nevertheless, even after
                        judgment such partner could be brought in and made a party.

        Not Advisable for Attorney to Act as Notary and Verify Client's Divorce Complaint.
       </b> - It is not advisable for a notary who is also a partner in a law firm acting of counsel to an attorney filing a divorce complaint to notarize the verification of the client. A divorce complaint which is not properly
                        notarized is subject to dismissal. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James Lee Knight, Notary Public, Guilford County, - N.C.A.G. - (May 18, 1988).

                    <p>
                        When one partner of Firm A appears as attorney for a plaintiff in a divorce proceeding, the other partners in the firm also "appear," and they could be prohibited under former G.S. 47-8 from notarizing the verification of the client. This would be true
                        whether or not the firm appears as "of counsel" to the individual partner on the face of the complaint or answer. Therefore, such practice should be avoided, and as an attorney/notary who acts in this fashion proceeds at his own
                        risk. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James Lee Knight, Notary Public, Guilford County, - N.C.A.G. - (May 18, 1988).

                    <p>
                        Pleadings not requiring verification by one of the parties are not subject to dismissal if they are verified anyway and a partner of the firm representing that client acts as the notary. However, former G.S. 47-8 would still seem to say that partner is
                        without power to act as a notary in that situation. The signature of the attorney signing the pleadings would be adequate under N.C.R.C.P., Rule 11(a). See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James Lee Knight, Notary Public, Guilford

                        Where one partner is sued individually for a tort committed by him in the course of the partnership business, a judgment would be binding upon him individually, and as to the partnership property, but not as against the other partner individually, though

                        Advising the initiation of a criminal prosecution is clearly within the normal range of activities for a typical law partnership, but taking such action maliciously and without probable cause is quite a different matter. A partner who gave such advice
                        was either conducting himself lawfully and ethically in his relationship with his client, in which event neither he nor any of his partners would have any liability, or he was conducting himself maliciously and unlawfully and would
                        not be acting in the ordinary course of the partnership business. Whatever may be the eventual determination of the conduct, it is evident that his partners, who did not authorize, participate in, or even know about such conduct,
                        would not be held responsible for any injury the conduct may have caused. Jackson v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 406, 201 S.E.2d 722 (1974).

                        Liability of Law Firm for Partner's Activities. - In order to determine whether members of a law firm should be held liable for the activities of one of its partners, the court should consider (1) the provisions of the instrument empowering the firm to
                        practice law, such as partnership agreements and articles of incorporation, as well as statutory provisions; (2) the construction which our courts have historically given the questioned activity or related ones; (3) where the partner
                        has acted, or seemed to act, with the firm's authority; this includes his position in the firm, the participation, if any, by the rest of the firm in the disputed activities, and any assurances given the client that this transaction
                        would be handled through the firm; and finally, (4) whether the other members of the firm have assented to or ratified the acts. Shelton v. Fairley, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 147, 356 S.E.2d

                        Trial court did not err in dismissing a client's professional malpractice claims against law firms because there was nothing in the complaint to suggest that the law firms authorized, participated in, or even knew about an attorney's fraudulent conduct;
                        fraud associated with the attorney's representation, including the failure to keep the client informed about the status of his case and the active concealment of the true state of affairs in violation of N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.4,

                        when the Rules of Civil Procedure require that he be served with process individually before being held individually liable. Stevens v. Nimocks, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 346 S.E.2d

                        Notice Held Sufficient. - Where defendants, who were general partners, were sued individually, and the prayer for relief asked for enforcement of arbitration award against all defendants jointly and severally, the individual defendants were on notice
                        that plaintiff 's complaint sought to hold them individually liable for any award made in the arbitration; with that knowledge, defendants filed an answer requesting that the action be stayed pending determination of the claims
                        in the arbitration proceeding; therefore, defendants were on notice that the arbitration proceeding would affect them individually, and not only as partners, even though the defendants were not named individually in the arbitration
                        proceeding. George W. Kane, Inc. v. Bolin Creek West Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 135, 381 S.E.2d 832 (1989).

                        Burden of Proof Where Partner Did Not Sign in Name of Partnership. - Where one partner did not sign either a promissory note or mortgage in the name of the alleged partnership, the plaintiff had the burden of showing either that (1) that partner was acting
                        on behalf of the partnership when he executed the note and mortgage and the other partner had authorized his acts, or (2) the other partner, with knowledge of the note and mortgage, ratified his acts. Hines v. Arnold,

                        Repayment of Note Out of Partnership Funds. - Regardless of whether a note was signed by the parties as individuals or as partners, its legal effect was the same. Nevertheless, in a dissolution action, where it appeared that the note was executed in furtherance
                        of the partnership, and that there may have been partnership funds available to satisfy it, the court should have determined the nature of the note and ordered it repaid out of partnership funds if possible. Ludwig v. Walter,

                        The essentials of equitable estoppel or estoppel in pais are a representation, either by words or conduct, made to another, who reasonably believing the representation to be true, relies upon it, with the result that he changes his position to his detriment.

                        Evidence that son was authorized to write checks on father's corporate account did not constitute, in the absence of other fundamental requisites, a partnership in fact. In the absence of representations made by the defendant personally to third-party
                        creditors and of any expression of consent on the part of the defendant to his son that the son could represent him to be a partner, there was no evidentiary support for plaintiff's contention that representations were made in
                        a public manner, so that under these circumstances, the evidence was not sufficient to warrant submitting the case to the jury upon the theory of partnership by estoppel.

                        a partnership was established between the partners and widow based upon the legal principles of partnership by estoppel or apparent authority; although the widow denied that she had knowledge of the terms of the partnership agreement,
                        her deposition testimony indicated that she was fully aware there was some sort of arrangement for the partners to work for the hog farm operation, the partners continued to perform their obligations after the husband's death,

                        The interest of partners in the partnership is personal property, even though part of the partnership assets is real estate. Hence, upon the death of the partners, their respective personal representatives were properly made parties to prosecute and defend
                        an action for an accounting and proper application of partnership property on behalf of their intestates. Bright v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 648</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 247 (1957).

                        Partner's Interest Not Subject to Statute of Frauds. - A partner's interest in partnership assets - including real property - is a personal property interest. As such, it is not subject to the statute of frauds. Potter v. Homestead Preservation Ass'n,

                        However, land owned individually by one who entered into a partnership could not become a partnership asset absent some written agreement sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, despite G.S. 59-40(c), which recognizes that title to real property
                        may be in the name of one or more, but not all, of the partners, and this section, which makes a partner's interest in partnership property, even real property, a personal property interest. Ludwig v. Walter,

                        Trial court erred in granting a widow summary judgment in partners' action alleging that a partnership with her deceased husband did not dissolve upon his death because presumably, upon the husbands death, the benefits and burdens of his interest in the
                        partnership passed to the widow; the husband proposed that his and the widow's partnership interest be passed to their surviving children if both of them died prior to a certain date, and although both the husband and widow did
                        not die before that date, the provision showed an intent for the business relationship with the partners to continue in the event of the husband's death. Wiggs v. Peedin, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite>                        481, 669 S.E.2d 844 (2008).

                        Distinction Between Partnership for Indefinite Period and One for Specified Term as Concerns Dissolution. - According to the majority view, the only difference, so far as concerns the rights of dissolution by one partner, between a partnership for an
                        indefinite period and one for a specified term, is that in the case of a partnership for a definite term a dissolution before the expiration of the stipulated time is a breach of agreement which subjects such partner to a claim
                        for damages for breach of contract if the dissolution is not justified, whereas the dissolution of a partnership at will affords the other partner no ground for complaint; in either case, the action of one partner actually dissolves
                        the partnership. Campbell v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 143</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 564 (1968).

                        The significance of a partnership being one at will, i.e., without any definite term or undertaking to be accomplished, is that the termination by the election of a partner is not a breach of contract. Having the legal right to terminate, it would seem
                        that there is no liability for its exercise whatever the motive, and whatever may be the injurious consequences to copartners who have neglected to protect themselves by an agreement to continue for a definite term. Campbell v.

                        Assertion of Lien on Partnership Assets Based on Claim of Fraud. - While it is well settled that each partner has the right to insist that partnership assets be applied in payment of partnership debts, the right is not, in fact, a lien as such, because
                        it is equally well settled that a partner has no individual ownership in any specific assets of the firm. The right, lien, quasi-lien or whatever else it may be called does not exist for any practical purpose until the affairs
                        of the partnership have to be wound up or the share of a partner has to be ascertained. Such a lien based on fraud does not come into existence until actual dissolution occurs. Wolfe v. Hewes, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite>                        88, 254 S.E.2d 204 (1979).

                    When any partner retires or dies, and the business is continued under any of the conditions set forth in G.S. 59-71, subsections (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), or G.S. 59-68, subdivision (b)(2), without any settlement of accounts as between him or his estate
                    and the person or partnership continuing the business, unless otherwise agreed, he or his legal representative as against such persons or partnership may have the value of his interest at the date of dissolution ascertained, and shall
                    receive as an ordinary creditor an amount equal to the value of his interest in the dissolved partnership with interest, or, at his option or at the option of his legal representative, in lieu of interest, the profits attributable
                    to the use of his right in the property of the dissolved partnership; provided that the creditors of the dissolved partnership as against the separate creditors, or the representative of the retired or deceased partner, shall have
                    priority on any claim arising under this section, as provided by G.S. 59-71, subsection (h).

                        Interest on Award for Judicial Accounting. - G.S. 59-72, which specifically addresses interest on an award for judicial accounting, upon a partner's retirement from a partnership, controls over the general statute dealing with interest on judgments. Lewis
                        v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 554 S.E.2d 17 (2001).

                        Date From Which Interest was Calculated - Interest was properly calculated, based on G.S. 59-72, from the date of the dissolution of a professional certified accounting practice, where the withdrawing partner had paid partnership debts after withdrawing
                        from the partnership; the date of the payment of debts, which occurred about two-and-a-half years after the dissolution, was not the date from which interest would be calculated for the monies paid toward the partnership debts,
                        as the trial court had already adjusted the value of the partnership assets, as of the date of dissolution, as a result of the payment of the debts. Lewis v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite>                        384, 583 S.E.2d 387 (2003).

                    changed the effective date of Session Laws 2001-358 from October 1, 2001, to January 1, 2002. Section 6 of Session Laws 2001-413, effective September 14, 2001, added a sentence to s. 175(a) of Session Laws 2001-387, making s. 173 of
                    that act effective when it became law (August 26, 2001). As a result of these changes, the amendment by Session Laws 2001-358 is effective January 1, 2002, and applicable to documents submitted for filing on or after that date.

                    Session Laws 2001-387, ss. 105(b), 112, and 115, effective January 1, 2002, in subdivision (b)(2), recodified former G.S. 59-73.6 as this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section was amended several times in 2001 in the coded bill drafting format provided in G.S. 120-20.1. Session Laws 2001-358, s. 10 (a) amended subsection (b)(2) of
                    <span class="s2">
       §
      </span> 59-73.6 by substituting "59-35.1(c)" for "59-73.7(c)." The section was then recodified as
                    <span class="s2">
       §
      </span> 59-73.33 by Session Laws 2001-387, s. 105(b). Without referring to the change made by Session Laws 2001-358 in subsection (b)(2), Session Laws 2001-387, ss. 115 and 170(c) subsequently amended subsection (b)(2) by substituting
                    "59-35.1(f)" for "59-73.7(c)" and then substituting "59-35.2" for "59-35.1(f)." The fees that were to have been in G.S. 59-35.1(c), as amended in Session Laws 2001-358, are now in G.S. 59-35.2. The section is set out in the form above
                    at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes.

       Effect of Amendments.
      </b> - Session Laws 2011-347, ss. 17 and 18, effective October 1, 2011, in subdivision (a)(6), deleted "dissenting" preceding "shareholders" and inserted "exercising appraisal rights" near the middle; and, in subdivision (b)(1),
                    substituted "appraisal rights of shareholders" for "rights of dissenting shareholders" near the middle.

                    Upon the death of any member of a partnership, the surviving partner shall, within 30 days, execute before the clerk of the superior court of the county where the partnership business was conducted, a bond payable to the State of North Carolina, with
                    sufficient surety conditioned upon the faithful performance of his duties in the settlement of the partnership affairs. The amount of such bond shall be fixed by the clerk of the court; and the settlement of the estate and the liability
                    of the bond shall be the same as under the law governing administrators and their bonds.

                        The purpose of this section is limited to the protection of those who are interested in the property or estate administered by the surviving partner, who is required to account to them and pay over their interest in case there is a surplus after paying
                        the partnership debts. It is a trust relationship in which only they have a legal interest. Coppersmith v. Upton, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 545</cite>, 46 S.E.2d 565 (1948).

                        Coverage of Bond. - The bond required of surviving partners by this section is primarily for the protection of those interested in the deceased partner's interest in the surplus after the partnership has been wound up; such bond has no retroactive effect,
                        and does not become liable for any maladministration prior to its filing. In re Estate of Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 59</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 223 (1950).

                        The giving of a bond cannot be regarded as a condition precedent to the maintenance of an action by a surviving partner, since G.S. 59-75 provides an alternative remedy upon failure of the surviving partner to give bond. Coppersmith v. Upton,

                        Upon the death of a partner, his interest in the partnership property vests in the surviving partner for administration in winding up the partnership, and the surviving partner stands as a trustee charged with the duty of faithful management and accounting
                        to those entitled to the deceased partner's interest after the settlement of the debts of the partnership. In re Estate of Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 59</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 223 (1950).

                    <p>
                        The surviving partner has the duty of closing up the partnership affairs, the reduction of personal property to cash and the settlement of partnership affairs, and title to the personal property vests at once in the surviving partner and not in the personal
                        representative of the deceased partner. Sherrod v. Mayo, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 144</cite>, 72 S.E. 216 (1911).

                        Assets Impressed with Trust. - The death of a partner, in the absence of any stipulation in the articles of partnership to the contrary, works an immediate dissolution, and the title to the assets vests in the surviving partner, impressed with a trust
                        to close up the partnership business, pay the debts and turn over to his personal representative the share of the deceased partner. Walker v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 448</cite>, 52 S.E. 125

                        It is the right and duty of a surviving partner to close up the affairs of the firm. He has the right, therefore, to receive and to collect the debts and assets of the partnership, and to apply the same toward payment of the debts and liabilities of the
                        firm. Weisel v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 22</cite>, 18 S.E. 943 (1894); Hodgin v. Bank, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 110</cite>, 38 S.E. 294 (1901).

                        Creation of New Debts. - A surviving partner has no right to create or contract new debts binding upon the partnership, except to the extent of purchasing new material and making new debts so far as may be necessary to work up unfinished material and
                        sell the same. Howell, Orr &amp; Co. v. Boyd Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 806</cite>, 22 S.E. 5 (1895).

                        A surviving partner who, more than two years after dissolution of the firm, endorsed a note in the firm name for the renewal of outstanding notes similarly endorsed, was individually liable on such endorsement, though it did not bind the firm. Bank v.

                        Injunction When There Is Danger of Misapplication of Funds. - In case of danger of misapplication of partnership funds by the surviving partner, the court would certainly, in behalf of the representatives of a deceased partner, interfere and restrain
                        by injunction the surviving partner from such acts, or grant other proper relief; and there is no reason why it should not interfere in behalf of a creditor in such a case. Hodgin v. Bank, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 110</cite>,

                        Surviving Partner Held Agent of Executor. - Where one of the members of a firm was constituted its general managing agent by the articles of partnership, and upon the death of one partner his executor consented to a continuance of the business, it was
                        held that the manager became the agent of the executor as well as of the other surviving member, and a demand and refusal to account were necessary to terminate the agency and put the statute of limitations in operation. Patterson

                    If the surviving partner should neglect or refuse to have such inventory made, the personal representative of the deceased partner may have the same made in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 59-76. Should any surviving partner fail to take such an

                        Jurisdiction to Appoint Receiver. - While the clerk of the superior court has no jurisdiction to appoint a receiver for a partnership under this section, when the surviving partners have failed or refused to file the inventory required by G.S. 59-76,
                        the superior court on appeal from an order of the clerk in the proceeding acquires jurisdiction to appoint such receiver. In re Estate of Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 59</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 223

                        that the assets of the partnership were sufficient to pay its debts and leave a surplus against the deceased partner's share, of which the note could be charged. Patton v. Carr, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 176</cite>,

                        Debts Created by Surviving Partner. - While a surviving partner cannot enter into contracts or create liabilities which will bind the estate of his deceased partner, yet he is not bound to sacrifice the interests of the firm, and if he contracts debts,
                        bona fide, for the interest of the common property, he may pay them out of the common fund. Calvert v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 600</cite> (1886).

                        105-131(b)(8), the partnership and its partners are subject to tax under Article 4 of Chapter 105 of the General Statutes to the same extent as a C corporation or an S corporation, as the case may be, and its shareholders. If any
                        such partnership is classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership, the partnership and its partners are subject to tax under Article 4 of Chapter 105 of the General Statutes accordingly. If any such partnership is
                        classified for federal income tax purposes as other than a corporation or a partnership, the partnership and its partners are subject to tax under Article 4 of Chapter 105 of the General Statutes in a manner consistent with that
                        classification. This section does not require a partnership, including any registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership authorized to transact business in this State, to obtain an administrative
                        ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its classification under the Internal Revenue Code.

                        by law for failure to pay such fees and taxes. In addition, the foreign limited liability partnership shall be liable for a civil penalty of ten dollars ($10.00) for each day, but not to exceed a total of one thousand dollars ($1,000)
                        for each year or part thereof, it transacts business in this State without having registered. The Attorney General may bring actions to recover all amounts due the State under the provisions of this subsection.

                        When Partner May Maintain Action Against Copartner. - As a general rule, one partner cannot sue another partner at law until there has been a complete settlement of the partnership affairs and a balance struck. However, a partner may maintain an action
                        at law against his copartner upon claims growing out of the following state of facts: (1) where the partnership is terminated, all debts paid, and the partnership affairs otherwise adjusted with nothing remaining to be done but
                        to pay over the amounts due by one to the other, such amount involving no complicated reckoning; (2) where the partnership is for a single venture or special purpose which has been accomplished, and nothing remains to be done except
                        to pay over the claimant's share; (3) when the joint property has been wrongfully destroyed or converted. Roper v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 64, 298 S.E.2d 424 (1982), cert. denied,

                    a partner ceases to be a partner and to have the power to exercise any rights and powers of a partner upon assignment of all of the partner's partnership interest. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, neither the pledge
                    or granting of a security interest in any or all of the partnership interest of a partner nor the pledge or granting of a lien or other encumbrance against any or all of the partnership interest of a partner shall cause the partner

                <p>
                    A limited partnership, a foreign limited partnership authorized to transact business in this State, and a partner of one of these partnerships are subject to taxation under Article 4 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html" target="_blank">Chapter 105</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes in accordance with their classification for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, if a limited partnership or a foreign limited partnership authorized to transact business in this State is classified for
                    federal income tax purposes as a C corporation as defined in G.S. 105-131(b)(2) or an S corporation as defined in G.S. 105-131(b)(8), the partnership and its partners are subject to tax under Article 4 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html" target="_blank">Chapter 105</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes to the same extent as a C corporation or an S corporation, as the case may be, and its shareholders. If a limited partnership or a foreign limited partnership authorized to transact business in this State is
                    classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership, the partnership and its partners are subject to tax under Article 4 of Chapter 105 of the General Statutes accordingly. If a limited partnership or a foreign limited partnership
                    authorized to transact business in this State is classified for federal income tax purposes as other than a corporation or a partnership, the partnership and its partners are subject to tax under Article 4 of Chapter 105 of the General
                    Statutes in a manner consistent with that classification. This section does not require a limited partnership or a foreign limited partnership to obtain an administrative ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its classification
                    under the Internal Revenue Code.
