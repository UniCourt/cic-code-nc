                        it was not the use of the word "reprocessed" which it considered deceptive, but rather the failure to make the additional specific disclosure that the reprocessed oil had been previously used, an order of the Commission prohibiting

                        shall officially seal all dispensing pumps or other dispensing devices found to be accurate on inspection. The finding, upon inspection at a later date, that any pump is inaccurate and the seal broken, shall constitute prima facie
                        evidence of intent to defraud by giving inaccurate measure, and (i) the owner, (ii) the user, or (iii) both of them shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Any person other than a registered petroleum device technician who removes
                        or breaks any seal placed upon a measuring or dispensing device by any oil and gas inspector until the provisions of this section have been complied with shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Any person, firm, or corporation

                    A person shall not hold himself out or commence operation as a dealer without first having registered as provided in this section. A dealer shall register with the Commissioner on a form to be furnished by the Commissioner. Such form shall give the name

                    Commissioner may from time to time request in writing that a dealer provide within 10 days of such request verification of said insurance coverage or proof of alternative means of financial responsibility. In lieu of insurance, the

                        by proof of payment of the assessment satisfactory to the Foundation. The Foundation shall mail a refund to the dealer within 30 days of receipt of a properly documented refund request, provided that the Foundation shall have no

                        Right. - When a contract calls for one party to reimburse a second party for the federal manufacturer's excise taxes levied on petroleum products in Part III of Subchapter A of Chapter 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, whether as a separate item or as
                        part of the price, the party making the reimbursement has the right to choose to tender payment for the taxes no more than one business day before the day the second party is required to remit the taxes to the federal Internal
                        Revenue Service. The party making the reimbursement has the option of exercising this right. Exercise of this right does not relieve the party of the obligation to make the reimbursement as provided for in the contract, but affects
                        only the timing of when that reimbursement must be tendered.

                        exercise. The effective date must be no earlier than the beginning of the next federal tax quarter or 30 days after the notice of intent is received, whichever is later.

                        on the contract as a whole. The second party may not, however, change the other payment terms of the contract without a valid business reason other than the exercise of the contractual right, except to require the payment of the
                        taxes under the contractual right to be made by electronic funds transfer.
