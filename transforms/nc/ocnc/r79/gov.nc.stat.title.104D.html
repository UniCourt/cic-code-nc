<p class="p3">Statute text</p>
<p class="p4">The Southern States Energy Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: <br>
</p>
<p class="p5">SOUTHERN STATES ENERGY COMPACT <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">ARTICLE I. Policy and Purpose. The party states recognize that the proper employment and conservation of energy and employment of energy-related facilities, materials, and products, within the context of a responsible regard for the environment, can assist substantially in the industrialization of the South and the development of a balanced economy for the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from and acquisition of energy resources and facilities require systematic encouragement, guidance, and assistance from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the economy of the South and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region's people. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">ARTICLE II. The Board. (a) There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the "Southern States Energy Board" (hereinafter called the Board). The Board shall be composed of three members from each party state, one of whom shall be appointed or designated in each state to represent the Governor, the State Senate and the State House of Representatives, respectively. Each member shall be designated or appointed in accordance with the law of the state which he represents and shall serve and be subject to removal in accordance with such law. Any member of the Board may provide for the discharge of his duties and the performance of his functions thereon, either for the duration of his membership or for any lesser period of time, by a deputy or assistant, if the laws of his state make specific provision therefor. The federal government may be represented without vote if provision is made by federal law for such representation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">(b)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each party state shall be entitled to one vote on the Board, to be determined by majority vote of each member or member's representative from the party state present and voting on any question. No action of the Board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of all party states are represented and unless a majority of the total number of votes on the Board are cast in favor thereof. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">(c)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Board shall have a seal. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">(e)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Executive Director, with the approval of the Board, shall appoint and remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the Board's functions irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">(f)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Board may establish and maintain, independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the party states, a suitable retirement system for its full-time employees. Employees of the Board shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivors insurance provided that the Board takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to federal law to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The Board may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as may be appropriate. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The Board shall publish its bylaws, rules, and regulations in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof, and shall also file a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">(k)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Board annually shall make to the Governor of each party state, a report covering the activities of the Board for the preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been adopted by the Board, which report shall be transmitted to the legislature of said state.
