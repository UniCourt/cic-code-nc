    Editor's Note.
   
   - Session Laws 1975, c. 604, repealed <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.127.html" target="_blank">Chapter 127</a></cite> and Article 23 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html" target="_blank">Chapter 143</a></cite> and enacted this Chapter in lieu thereof. Where appropriate, the historical citations to the sections of the repealed Chapter and Article have been added to the corresponding sections of the new Chapter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 1977, c. 70, s. 2, provided that whenever the words "Department of Military and Veterans Affairs" were used in G.S. 127A-1 through G.S. 127A-195, the same would be deleted and the words "Department of Crime Control and Public Safety" would be inserted in lieu thereof. The act made no mention of the Secretary of Military and Veterans Affairs; however, in order to give effect to its obvious intent, the editors have substituted "Secretary of Crime Control and Public Safety" for "Secretary of Military and Veterans Affairs" throughout this Chapter. Session Laws 2011-145, s. 19.1(g) further updated the chapter by substituting "Secretary of Public Safety" for "Secretary of Crime Control and Public Safety."

      The commander in chief may at any time, in order to execute the law, secure the safety of persons and property, suppress riots or insurrections, repel invasions or provide disaster relief, in addition to the North Carolina National Guard, the State defense militia and the naval militia, order out the whole or any part of the unorganized militia. When the militia of this State or a part thereof is called forth under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the Governor shall first order out for service the North Carolina National Guard, the State defense militia or naval militia, or any part thereof that may be necessary, and if the number available is insufficient, the Governor shall then order out any part of the unorganized militia that the Governor may deem necessary. During the absence or organizations of the North Carolina National Guard or naval militia in the service of the United States, their state designations shall not be given to new organizations.

       Release From State Duty. - Upon an employee's release from state duty, the employee's previous employer shall reemploy the employee in the employee's previous position within five days of the employee's release from state duty. If the employee's state duty lasted 30 days or less, the employee shall make written application to the employee's previous employer for reemployment no later than the first regularly scheduled work period that begins 24 hours after the employee has safely traveled from the place of state service to the employee's residence. If the employee's state duty lasted more than 30 days, the employee shall make written application to the employee's previous employer for reemployment within 14 days of the employee's release from state duty. If the employee is still qualified for the employee's previous employment, the employee shall be restored to the employee's previous position or to a position of like seniority, status, and salary, unless the employer's circumstances at that time make the restoration unreasonable. If the employee is no longer qualified for the employee's previous employment, the employee shall be placed in another position for which the employee is qualified and that will give the employee appropriate seniority, status, and salary, unless the employer's circumstances at that time make the placement unreasonable.

The period of recovery is the period necessary for the employee to recover from the illness or injury, not to exceed two years unless the Commissioner of Labor extends the period. The Commissioner may extend the two-year period of recovery only if (i) the employee files with the Commissioner a written request for extension at least 15 days prior to the expiration of the two-year period of recovery and (ii) the Commissioner finds that reemployment during the two-year period would place an undue burden on the employee. The Commissioner, if extending the two-year period of recovery, shall notify the employee's previous employer of the amount of the extension. A party who is dissatisfied with a decision of the Commissioner may commence a contested case under Article 3 of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.

        Preclusion from Recovery.

       - G.S. 127A-202 and G.S. 127A-203 only provide a remedy for National Guardsmen who have been denied reinstatement to their employment upon return from active duty. Thus, where an employee, who was a Guardsmen did not claim that he was denied reemployment to his previous position after a period of active service, he had no cause of action under G.S. 127A-202 and G.S. 127A-203.
