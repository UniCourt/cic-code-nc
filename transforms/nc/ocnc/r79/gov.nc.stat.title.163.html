     Editor's Note.

            and
        </p>
        <p>
            "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that the State Board of Elections, which is charged with elections administration and campaign finance enforcement, is an 'independent regulatory and quasi-judicial agency and shall not be placed within any principal
            administrative department' pursuant to G.S. 163-28; and
        </p>
        <p>
            "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that the State Ethics Commission, which is charged with interpretation of the State Government Ethics Act and the Lobbying Law, is 'located within the Department of Administration for administrative purposes only,
            but shall exercise all of its powers, including the power to employ, direct, and supervise all personnel, independently of the Secretary of Administration' pursuant to G.S. 138A-9; and
        </p>
        <p>
            "Whereas, the functions of ethics, elections, and lobbying affect and regulate a similar group of persons; and

            "Whereas, the rights of that group of persons affected may include issues directly related to the First Amendment right of free speech; and

        <p>
            "Whereas, the General Assembly finds it beneficial and conducive to consistency to establish one quasi-judicial and regulatory body with oversight authority for ethics, elections, and lobbying; and
        </p>
        <p>
            "Whereas, the General Assembly also finds it imperative to ensure protections of free speech rights and increase public confidence in the decisions to restrict free speech; and
        </p>
        <p>
            "Whereas, the General Assembly finds that voices from all major political parties should be heard in decisions relating to First Amendment rights of free speech; and
        </p>

       Implement the North Carolina Supreme Court's Holding in
       <i>
        Cooper v. Berger
       </i>
       by Giving the Governor Increased Control Over the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement.
      </b> - Session Laws 2018-2, s. 8(a), provides: "The General Assembly finds that the legislative intent in the enactment of S.L. 2017-6 and establishment of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement was to
                    continue the practice of having an independent, quasi-judicial body for elections and ethics enforcement for the State and consolidate those bodies under a single entity. The General Assembly finds that the entity enforcing these laws
                    must have sufficient distance from political interference due to the potential for abuse of oversight of elections and ethics investigations for partisan purposes. The General Assembly further finds that appointment of a State Board
                    member who is not affiliated with the two largest political parties will foster nonpartisan decision-making by the State Board. As such, by amending the section of the General Statutes establishing the membership of the State Board
                    enacted in S.L. 2017-6, the purpose of this legislation is to implement the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court on January 26, 2018, in
                    <i>
       Cooper v. Berger
      </i> (No. 52PA17-2) to give the Governor executive control over the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement and to provide for representation on the State Board by unaffiliated and third-party voters."

       </i>
       by Giving the Governor Increased Control Over the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement.
      </b> - Session Laws 2018-2, s. 8(a), provides: "The General Assembly finds that the legislative intent in the enactment of S.L. 2017-6 and establishment of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement was to
                    continue the practice of having an independent, quasi-judicial body for elections and ethics enforcement for the State and consolidate those bodies under a single entity. The General Assembly finds that the entity enforcing these laws
                    must have sufficient distance from political interference due to the potential for abuse of oversight of elections and ethics investigations for partisan purposes. The General Assembly further finds that appointment of a State Board
                    member who is not affiliated with the two largest political parties will foster nonpartisan decision-making by the State Board. As such, by amending the section of the General Statutes establishing the membership of the State Board
                    enacted in S.L. 2017-6, the purpose of this legislation is to implement the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court on January 26, 2018, in
                    <i>
       Cooper v. Berger
      </i> (No. 52PA17-2) to give the Governor executive control over the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement and to provide for representation on the State Board by unaffiliated and third-party voters."

                        <i>
        163-22(l)
       </i> required any appeal taken from a decision of the State Board of Elections to be filed in the Superior Court of Wake County; in this case where a county director of elections challenged his purported termination, his
                        failure to comply with this statutory requirement meant the Superior Court of New Hanover County, where he filed this appeal, was without jurisdiction. The trial court's orders were void ab initio and vacated. McFadyen v. New Hanover

                        Supervisory and Other Powers. - The State Board of Elections has general supervision over the primaries and elections in the State, with authority to promulgate legally consistent rules and regulations for their conduct and to compel the observance of
                        the election laws by county boards of elections, and the duty of the Board to canvass the returns and declare the county does not affect its supervisory power, which perforce must be exercised prior to the final acceptance of the
                        returns made by the county boards. Burgin v. North Carolina State Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 140</cite>, 198 S.E. 592 (1938).

                        The General Assembly has given the State Board of Elections power to supervise primaries and general elections to the end that, insofar as possible, the results in primary and general elections in this State will not be influenced or tainted with fraud,
                        corruption or other illegal conduct on the part of election officials or others. Ponder v. Joslin, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 496</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 143 (1964).

                        Plaintiffs were not permitted leave to amend, because the enforcement of Session Law 2013-110 fell to the Wake County Board of Elections and no enforcement power of the law resided within the Governor, the House Speaker, or the Senate President Pro Tem,
                        who were named in the proposed amended complaint; therefore, an amendment that cast them as defendants would be futile. Wright v. North Carolina, 975 F. Supp. 2d 539 (E.D.N.C. 2014), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 787 F.3d 256,

                        Appeal by the North Carolina State Board of Elections (Board) of an order to adopt an early voting plan was moot because the election was held and voters contesting the plan received requested relief so an appellate court had no jurisdiction to consider
                        the Board's claim that a trial court had no jurisdiction to review the Board's actions pursuant to the Board's supervisory power over county boards of elections. Anderson v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections,

                        Appellate court had no jurisdiction to consider the North Carolina State Board of Elections' (Board) claim that a trial court had no jurisdiction to review the Board's acts pursuant to the Board's exercise of the Board's supervisory power over county
                        boards of elections because: (1) the claim was raised in a moot appeal of an order to adopt an early voting plan; and (2) the capable of repetition yet evading review exception to mootness did not apply as the same voters who brought
                        the underlying contest were unlikely to be subject to the same action, as the "same action" was not the Board's defense of a future plan but if future voters would claim a plan violated the constitutional rights of voters aged
                        18 to 25, and the Board was not the same "complaining party." Anderson v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 788 S.E.2d 179 (2016).

                        Power to Make Rules and Regulations Not in Conflict with Law. - The General Assembly has conferred upon the State Board of Elections power to make reasonable rules and regulations for carrying into effect the law it was created to administer, but has
                        annexed to the grant of this power the express limitation that such rules and regulations must not conflict with any provisions of such law. This specific restriction would have been inseparably wedded to the authority granted
                        even if the statutes had been silent with respect to it, because the Constitution forbids the legislature to delegate the power to make law to any other body. States' Rights Democratic Party v. State Bd. of Elections,

                        Authority to Hear and Act on Complaints. - The legislature has mandated that the State Board of Elections shall compel observance of the election laws. To do so, the State Board of Elections must have authority to hear and act on complaints, whether they
                        arise by petitions filed in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Board or otherwise. In re Judicial Review by Republican Candidates, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 556,

                        upon appeal from a county board or upon a protest filed in apt time with the State Board of Elections, may take such action as the findings of fact may justify, and may direct a county board of elections to amend its returns in

                        there can be no doubt but that persons elected to county offices in the election to be inquired into are entitled to notice.

                    Former G.S. 163A-7, authorized the former Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement to obtain criminal records checks and clearly pertained to elections personnel. It is not clear, however, that it was also intended to cover non-elections

                        Writ of Mandamus Directing Board of County Commissioners to Pay Employee of Board of Elections was Proper. - Writ of mandamus directing a county board of commissioners (commissioners) to pay an employee of a county board of elections (elections board)
                        was proper because: (1) so long as the elections board remained within the budget allocated by the commissioners, the elections board had the sole authority to hire and fire elections employees; and (2) it was uncontested that
                        there were sufficient funds in the budget to pay the employee so the commissioners' duty to pay the employee was ministerial. Graham County Bd. of Elections v.

                        is necessary for the county boards to hear the challenges and make the amended returns acting as a body in a duly assembled legal session; action taken and amended returns made by two members of the county board of each county,
                        respectively, without notice to the third member, are void as a matter of law. Burgin v. North Carolina State Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 140</cite>, 198 S.E. 592 (1938).

                        Burden of Proof on Challenger of Referendum. - The appellants, who challenged a citywide referendum allowing the sale of mixed beverages, failed to meet their burden of showing that absent the alleged voting irregularities, the referendum would have failed,
                        where the appellants argued that if the five disclosed illegal votes were subtracted, and the five undisclosed illegal votes ignored, the result would have been a tie, 4996 in favor and 4996 against, and the referendum proposition
                        would have failed; because the election occurred prior to the enactment of the amendment to this section, the appellants should have set forth evidence that they objected to the five voters' failure to testify or attempted to compel
                        such testimony. In re Ramseur, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 442, 533 S.E.2d 295 (2000).

                        was proper because: (1) so long as the elections board remained within the budget allocated by the commissioners, the elections board had the sole authority to hire and fire elections employees and (2) it was uncontested that there

                        members, under G.S. 163-30, and could remove the members, under G.S. 163-22(c); and (2) G.S. 163-25 allowed the State Board of Elections to assist the board regarding litigation which was initiated. Graham County Bd. of Elections

                        whether a nominee with a criminal history shall be selected. If the Executive Director determines a nominee shall not be selected and does not issue a letter of appointment, the decision of the Executive Director of the State Board
                        shall be final unless the decision is, within 10 days from the official date on which it was made, deferred by the State Board. If the State Board defers the decision, then the State Board shall make a final decision on appointment
                        of the director of elections and may direct the Executive Director to issue a letter of appointment. If an Executive Director issues a letter of appointment, the county board of elections shall enter in its official minutes the
                        specified duties, responsibilities and designated authority assigned to the director by the county board of elections. The specified duties and responsibilities shall include adherence to the duties delegated to the county board
                        of elections pursuant to G.S. 163-33. A copy of the specified duties, responsibilities and designated authority assigned to the director shall be filed with the State Board of Elections. In the event the Executive Director is recused
                        due to an actual or apparent conflict of interest from rendering a decision under this section, the chair and vice-chair of the State Board shall designate a member of staff to fulfill those duties.

                        state the reasons for termination. Upon receipt of the petition, the Executive Director shall forward a copy of the petition by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the county director of elections involved. The county
                        director of elections may reply to the petition within 15 days of receipt thereof. Within 20 days of receipt of the county director of elections' reply or the expiration of the time period allowed for the filing of the reply, the

                        the county director of elections an opportunity to be heard and to present witnesses and information to the State Board, and then notify the Executive Director of its decision in writing. Any one or more members of the State Board

                        the inspection at times specified by the State Board of Elections, but not less than three times during election day with the spacing not less than one hour apart.

                    Instead of having an observer receive the voting list, the county party chair may send a runner to do so, even if an observer has not been appointed for that precinct. The runner may be the precinct party chair or any person named by the county party
                    chair. Each county party chair using runners in an election shall provide to the county board of elections before 10:00 A.M. on the fifth day before election day a list of the runners to be used. That party chair must notify the chair
                    of the county board of elections or the board chair's designee of the names of all runners to be used in each precinct before the runner goes to the precinct. The runner may receive a voter list from the precinct on the same schedule
                    as an observer. Whether obtained by observer or runner, each party is entitled to only one voter list at each of the scheduled times. No runner may enter the voting enclosure except when necessary to announce that runner's presence
                    and to receive the list. The runner must leave immediately after being provided with the list.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2005-2, s. 1, provides: "The General Assembly makes the following findings:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) In 2003, the General Assembly enacted S.L. 2003-226, which contained a number of changes to the State's election laws, designed in part to implement provisions of the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) in such a way as to avoid having separate
                    laws for federal and State elections and otherwise to encourage and expand the exercise of the franchise. One such enactment was codified as G.S. 163-166.11, which spells out procedures for the casting of provisional official ballots.
                    A voter's eligibility to cast a provisional official ballot depends on being a registered voter in the jurisdiction in which the voter seeks to vote. The 'jurisdiction' in which a voter in North Carolina registers to vote is the county.
                    This is the unmistakable meaning of G.S. 163-82.1 and has not heretofore been challenged or questioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) In S.L. 2003-226, the General Assembly expressly stated its intent to 'ensure that the State of North Carolina has a system for all elections that complies with the requirements for federal elections set forth in' HAVA. It was then and is now the
                    intent of the General Assembly that the provisions of HAVA be broadly construed and that they be implemented in North Carolina in a manner to ensure a unified system of federal and State elections in compliance with HAVA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that any individual who is a registered voter in a county but whose name does not appear on the official list of registered voters at the voting place at which
                    that voter appears be allowed to cast a provisional official ballot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that all provisional ballots be counted for all those ballot items for which a voter was eligible to vote. In enacting G.S. 163-166.11 in 2003, the General
                    Assembly was fully mindful of and intended to reinforce the fact that prior statutory enactments in 2001 had already recognized the right of a voter to cast a provisional ballot and to have that ballot counted for all items for which
                    that voter was eligible to vote. See G.S. 163-182.2(a)(4). Even prior to 2003, the General Statutes recognized the right of a registered voter to cast a provisional ballot and to have that ballot counted for all those items for which
                    the voter was duly qualified to vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that the State Board of Elections act in a manner that would result in a single system for federal and State elections, rather than one system for federal
                    elections and another for State elections. In enacting G.S. 163-166.11 in 2003, the General Assembly was mindful of and intended to reinforce the fact that it had already provided in 2001 in G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) that the State Board
                    of Elections would adopt rules to ensure that voters 'not clearly eligible to vote in the precinct but who seek to vote there are given proper assistance in voting a provisional official ballot or guidance to another voting place where
                    they are eligible to vote.' The possibility of out-of-precinct provisional voting was thus recognized by the General Assembly as early as 2001.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) The law regarding provisional ballots does not rest solely on G.S. 163-82.15(e), which addresses the narrow circumstance of 'Unreported Move[s] to Another Precinct Within the County.' Though that statute mentions two ways in which precinct officials
                    may process registrants, it is not exclusive. G.S. 163-82.15(e) is part of the statutory Article on voter registration, rather than on voting, and should be read in that context. It was enacted in 1994, before provisional voting was
                    codified in North Carolina. The enactment of G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) in 2001 is the authority giving the State Board of Elections the duty to apply the broader laws of provisional voting, including G.S. 163-166.11. Any reading of G.S.
                    163-166.11 that would limit that statute's provisions to the narrower class of voting situations governed by the earlier enacted provisions of G.S. 163-82.15(e) would ignore the long-standing principle of statutory construction that
                    statutes relating to the same subject matter should be reconciled in such a manner as to effect the scope and meaning of the later enactment and read in a manner that would tend most completely to secure the rights of all persons affected
                    by the legislation. It was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly in enacting G.S. 163-166.11 to expand the exercise of the franchise, not to limit it or to restrict it by the terms of earlier and narrower enactments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) The State Board of Elections and all county boards of elections were following the intent of the General Assembly when they administered G.S. 163-166.11 and the earlier enacted statutes in G.S. 163-182.2(a)(4) and G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) to count in
                    whole or in part ballots cast by registered voters in the county who voted outside their resident precincts in the July 20, 2004, Primary, the August 17, 2004, Second Primary, and the November 2, 2004, General Election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(8) Several hundred thousand registered North Carolina voters cast ballots outside their resident precincts during the one-stop absentee balloting ('early voting') period pursuant to G.S. 163-227.2 prior to the General Election in November 2004, during
                    the two primaries in 2004, and then on the date of the General Election in November 2004. There is no statutory basis upon which to distinguish out-of-precinct voting that occurred on the date of the General Election in November 2004
                    from out-of-precinct voting that occurred during the First and Second Primaries in 2004 or that occurred during the period of one-stop absentee ('early') voting prior to the General Election of 2004.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(9) The General Assembly takes note of the fact that of those registered voters who happened to vote provisional ballots outside their resident precincts on the day of the November 2004 General Election, a disproportionately high percentage were African-American.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(10) The General Assembly notes that in addition to provisional voting on the date of the General Election pursuant to G.S. 163-166.11, the General Statutes abound with provisions that allow voters to cast votes outside their resident precincts:
                </p>

                <p>
                    "e. Temporarily voting in an adjacent precinct, G.S. 163-128.

                </p>
                <p>
                    "g. Voting at a central location in the county by voters who no longer live in the precinct where their name is listed on registration lists, G.S. 163-82.15(e).
                </p>
                <p>
                    "All those provisions were enacted prior to G.S. 163-166.11. Most were enacted decades before. As many as 1,000,000 people in North Carolina may have cast out-of-precinct votes using all out-of-precinct methods in 2004.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(11) It would be fundamentally unfair to discount the provisional official ballots cast by properly registered and duly qualified voters voting and acting in reliance on the statutes adopted by the General Assembly and administered by the State Board
                    of Elections in accordance with its intent. Moreover, to subtract such ballots only from the count for the General Election of 2004 without also doing so for the First or Second Primaries of 2004 would create a bizarre result in which
                    out-of-precinct provisional ballots are allowed to count for some elections but not others. The General Assembly did not and does not now intend to create such a system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(12) Even if the State Board of Elections had misread the language and intent of the General Statutes concerning provisional voting, which it did not do, it has been the long-standing and hitherto unquestioned law of this State, confirmed by prior decisions
                    of the North Carolina Supreme Court, that an innocent voter's ballot shall not be disqualified because of errors or omissions by elections officials. This fundamental principle was adopted by Justice Samuel J. Ervin Jr. in the case
                    of
                    <i>
    Owens v. Chaplin,

                    'We can conceive of no principle which permits the disfranchisement of innocent voters for the mistake, or even the willful misconduct, of election officials in performing the duty cast upon them. The object of elections is to ascertain the popular will,
                    and not to thwart it. The object of election laws is to secure the rights of duly-qualified electors, and not to defeat them.'

                    be called into question by retroactively revisiting the propriety of provisional ballots cast by duly registered voters of a county.

                            Right of teachers in a locality to vote therein depends on whether they were residents therein only for the scholastic year. A question is incompetent that asks them of their intention to make the locality their legal residence, since the answer involves
                            a question of law as to what constitutes a sufficient legal residence to qualify them to vote. State ex rel. Gower v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 697</cite>, 143 S.E. 513 (1928).

                            temporary purposes, but that at no time did they intend to make the other state or the other county in this State a permanent home, was insufficient to support a finding that they had lost their domicile in the county for the
                            purpose of voting. State ex rel. Owens v. Chaplin, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 705</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 12, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 797</cite>, 48 S.E.2d 37 (1948).

                        <p>
                            There is a rebuttable presumption that a student who leaves his parents' home for college is not a resident for voting purposes of the place where the college is located. The effect of this presumption is to place the burden of going forward with some
                            proof of residence on a student seeking to register to vote. As with other persons, the student has the burden of persuasion on the issue. Lloyd v. Babb, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>,
                            251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).

                        <p>
                            College students. - The presumption is that a student who leaves his parents' home to enter college is not domiciled in the college town to which he goes; however, this presumption is rebuttable. Hall v. Wake County Bd. of Elections,
                            <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 600</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 52 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Rebuttable presumption regarding students' domicile does not treat students differently from the rest of the population, but is merely a specialized statement of the general rule that the burden of proof is on one alleging a change in domicile. Lloyd
                            v. Babb, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).

                        <p>
                            There is no denial of equal protection in the use of the rebuttable presumption that a student who leaves his parents' home to go to college is not domiciled in the place where the college is located. Lloyd v. Babb, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>,
                            251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).

                            Student need not intend to stay in college community beyond graduation to establish domicile there. - A student who intends to remain in college community only until graduation should not for that reason alone be denied the right to vote in that community.
                            Insofar as Hall v. Wake County Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 600</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 52 (1972), may be interpreted to the contrary, it is modified accordingly. Lloyd v. Babb,
                            <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).

                            Test of Student's Domicile. - A student is entitled to register to vote at the place where he is attending school if he can show by his declarations and by objective facts that he (1) has abandoned his prior home, (2) has a present intention of making
                            the place where he is attending school his home, and (3) intends to remain in the college town at least as long as he is a student there and until he acquires a new domicile. Lloyd v. Babb,
                            <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).

                            A student's residence for voting purposes is a question of fact dependent upon the circumstances of each individual's case. There is no permissible manner for making group determinations of residence. Lloyd v. Babb, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>,

                            Whether a student's voting residence is at the location of the college he is attending or at the location where he lived before he entered college is a question of fact which depends upon the circumstances of each individual case. Hall v. Wake County

                            251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).

                            It is reasonable for election officials to inquire of students seeking to register more thoroughly than of other persons. This additional screening procedure is not an impermissible attempt to "fence out" a segment of the community because of the way
                            they may vote, but is instead a permissible attempt to determine who are members of the relevant community. Lloyd v. Babb, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).

                        <p>
                            In order to determine whether in fact a student has abandoned his prior home and presently intends to make the college town his home and intends to remain in the college town at least as long as he is a student there, a registrar (now chief judge) should
                            make inquiry of students more searching and extensive than may generally be necessary with respect to other residents. The kinds of questions that should be asked are generally set out in Hall v. Wake County Bd. of Elections,
                            <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 600</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 52 (1972). A registrar is not limited to these questions. One that should be asked of all persons seeking to register is "Are you now registered to vote, and, if so, where?"

                            Constitutionality of Inquiry. - The use of direct and circumstantial evidence, including the results of inquiries into a student's ownership of property, vacation plans, etc., to determine the domicile of the student is not an unjustifiable intrusion
                            into the private affairs of students attempting to register to vote, and is not an attempt to make unconstitutional classifications on the basis of wealth, travel, and property ownership. Lloyd v. Babb,
                            <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).

                            where the practices and guidelines utilized are not devices to keep students who are legal residents from voting, but rather are designed to help registrars (now chief judges) obtain the necessary facts to determine whether
                            a student is entitled to vote in a particular locality. Lloyd v. Babb, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).

                            form of a questionnaire to be devised by the court or by the county board of elections under the court's supervision. Lloyd v. Babb, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 416</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 843 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Power of General Assembly to Enact Registration Laws. - While the General Assembly cannot add to the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution for voters, it has the power, and it is its duty, to enact such registration laws as will protect the rights
                        of duly qualified voters, and no person is entitled to vote until he has complied with the requirements of those laws. Harris v. Scarborough, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 232</cite>, 14 S.E. 737 (1892),
                        overruled on other grounds, State ex rel. Quinn v. Lattimore, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 426</cite>, 26 S.E. 640 (1897).

                    <p>
                        But a vote received and deposited by the judges of election is presumed to be a legal vote, although the voter may not have complied with the requirements of the registration law; and it then devolves upon the party contesting to show that it was an illegal
                        vote and this cannot be shown by showing that the registration law had not been complied with. State ex rel. Quinn v. Lattimore, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 426</cite>, 26 S.E. 640 (1897).
                        <br />

                        Requirements of the Registration Act are Mandatory - Harris v. Scarborough, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 232</cite>, 14 S.E. 737 (1892), overruled on other grounds, State ex rel. Quinn v. Lattimore, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 426</cite>,
                        26 S.E. 640 (1897).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right to Register Differs from Right to Reject a Vote. - While a party offering to vote without registration may be refused for not complying with the registration law, if the party is allowed to vote and his vote is received and deposited, the vote will
                        not afterwards be held to be illegal if he is otherwise qualified to vote. State ex rel. Quinn v. Lattimore, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 426</cite>, 26 S.E. 640 (1897).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Denial of registration and voting to persons qualified to vote vitiates the election, particularly where it would affect the result, even though the denial was by accident or mistake. McDowell v. Rutherford Ry. Constr. Co.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. 514</cite>, 2 S.E. 351 (1887). See also, Perry v. Whitaker, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. 475</cite> (1874); People ex rel. Van Bokkelen v. Canaday, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 198</cite>, 21 Am.

                    <p>
                        Effect of Irregularities. - Where the disregard of constitutional or statutory directions does not affect the result, it does not warrant a rejection of the vote. If none are incompetent to vote, the registration must be accepted as the act of a public
                        officer, which entitles the electors to vote, notwithstanding irregularities as to administering the oath, the registrar's (now chief judge's) appointment, etc. State ex rel. DeBerry v. Nicholson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 465</cite>, 9 S.E. 545 (1889).

                    <p>
                        Registration by One Other Than Registrar. - The fact that a qualified voter was registered by a third person, with whom the registrar (now chief judge) had left the books, does not disqualify him to vote, where such registration has been accepted as sufficient
                        by the registrar. State ex rel. Quinn v. Lattimore, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 426</cite>, 26 S.E. 638 (1897).
                        <br />

     §
    
</span> 2, Const., 1868, was satisfied by an oath to support the federal and state Constitutions. All valid laws, whether State or national, were included by implication. State ex rel. DeBerry v. Nicholson, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 465</cite>,
                        9 S.E. 545 (1889).

                        Failure to administer oath would not invalidate a school tax election to determine whether such tax should be levied, in the absence of fraud or improper motive. Gibson v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 510</cite>,
                        79 S.E. 976 (1913).

        Restrictions on Voting Mechanisms Used by Minority Voters.
       </b> - Minority voters were entitled to a preliminary injunction enjoining H.R. 589 (N.C. 2013) insofar as its elimination of same-day voter registration, G.S. 163-82.6(c), and its prohibition on counting out-of-precinct
                        ballots, because same-day registration and out-of-precinct ballots were used disproportionately by minority voters; under

                        Time for Books to Remain Open Under Former Law. - Where the charter of a city or town provided that for the issuance of bonds an election should be held "under the rules and regulations presented by law for regular elections," it referred to former G.S.
                        163-31, requiring that the books of registration should be kept open for twenty days, and construing that section in connection with G.S. 160-37 (now repealed) it was held that the former was for the purpose of a new and original
                        registration, and the latter, in providing for only seven days, was for the purpose of revising the registration books so that electors might be registered whose names were not on the former books. Hardee v. City of Henderson,

                    <p>
                        Registration on Day of Election. - Where a person otherwise legally qualified, who had not been allowed to register because at that time he had not been a resident of the State for one year, but who became qualified in that respect on or before the day
                        of election, asked to be allowed to register on election day and tendered his ballot, such vote should have been received. State ex rel. Quinn v. Lattimore, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 426</cite>, 26

                    <p>
                        Compliance Held Sufficient. - The statutory requirement that the registration be kept open and accessible for a specified time is regarded as essential by the courts in passing upon the validity of bonds to be issued by a municipality; but where it appeared
                        that the books were afterwards opened for a time actually sufficient to afford all an opportunity to register, though short of the legal period, and it further appeared that the election had been hotly contested by both sides,
                        it would be deemed sufficient. Hill v. Skinner, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 405</cite>, 86 S.E. 351 (1915).

                        Failure to keep registry open for twenty days, as required by former G.S. 163-31, for the purposes of issuance of bonds in a special school district, did not of itself render invalid the issuance of the bonds accordingly approved, when it appeared that
                        the matter was fully known and discussed, opportunity was offered every voter to register, there was nothing to show that every elector desiring to vote had not done so, and there was no opposition to the measure manifested. Hammond

                        Inquiry as to Qualifications of Voters. - Registrars (now chief judges) of election may ask an elector if he had resided in the State 12 months next preceding the election (now 30 days) and four months in the district in which he offers to vote (now also
                        30 days). They may ask an elector as to his age and residence, as well as the township and county from whence he removed, in the case of a removal since the last election, and as to the name by which he is commonly known. If, in
                        reply to such questions, the elector answers that he is 21 (now 18) years old, and has resided in the State 12 months (now 30 days) and in the county four months (now also 30 days) preceding the election, it is the duty of the
                        registrar, upon his taking the prescribed oath, to record his name as a voter; but bystanders may require him to be sworn as to his residence. In re Reid, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 641</cite>, 26 S.E.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2005-2, s. 1, provides: "The General Assembly makes the following findings:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) In 2003, the General Assembly enacted S.L. 2003-226, which contained a number of changes to the State's election laws, designed in part to implement provisions of the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) in such a way as to avoid having separate
                    laws for federal and State elections and otherwise to encourage and expand the exercise of the franchise. One such enactment was codified as G.S. 163-166.11, which spells out procedures for the casting of provisional official ballots.
                    A voter's eligibility to cast a provisional official ballot depends on being a registered voter in the jurisdiction in which the voter seeks to vote. The 'jurisdiction' in which a voter in North Carolina registers to vote is the county.
                    This is the unmistakable meaning of G.S. 163-82.1 and has not heretofore been challenged or questioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) In S.L. 2003-226, the General Assembly expressly stated its intent to 'ensure that the State of North Carolina has a system for all elections that complies with the requirements for federal elections set forth in' HAVA. It was then and is now the
                    intent of the General Assembly that the provisions of HAVA be broadly construed and that they be implemented in North Carolina in a manner to ensure a unified system of federal and State elections in compliance with HAVA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that any individual who is a registered voter in a county but whose name does not appear on the official list of registered voters at the voting place at which
                    that voter appears be allowed to cast a provisional official ballot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that all provisional ballots be counted for all those ballot items for which a voter was eligible to vote. In enacting G.S. 163-166.11 in 2003, the General
                    Assembly was fully mindful of and intended to reinforce the fact that prior statutory enactments in 2001 had already recognized the right of a voter to cast a provisional ballot and to have that ballot counted for all items for which
                    that voter was eligible to vote. See G.S. 163-182.2(a)(4). Even prior to 2003, the General Statutes recognized the right of a registered voter to cast a provisional ballot and to have that ballot counted for all those items for which
                    the voter was duly qualified to vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that the State Board of Elections act in a manner that would result in a single system for federal and State elections, rather than one system for federal
                    elections and another for State elections. In enacting G.S. 163-166.11 in 2003, the General Assembly was mindful of and intended to reinforce the fact that it had already provided in 2001 in G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) that the State Board
                    of Elections would adopt rules to ensure that voters 'not clearly eligible to vote in the precinct but who seek to vote there are given proper assistance in voting a provisional official ballot or guidance to another voting place where
                    they are eligible to vote.' The possibility of out-of-precinct provisional voting was thus recognized by the General Assembly as early as 2001.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) The law regarding provisional ballots does not rest solely on G.S. 163-82.15(e), which addresses the narrow circumstance of 'Unreported Move[s] to Another Precinct Within the County.' Though that statute mentions two ways in which precinct officials
                    may process registrants, it is not exclusive. G.S. 163-82.15(e) is part of the statutory Article on voter registration, rather than on voting, and should be read in that context. It was enacted in 1994, before provisional voting was
                    codified in North Carolina. The enactment of G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) in 2001 is the authority giving the State Board of Elections the duty to apply the broader laws of provisional voting, including G.S. 163-166.11. Any reading of G.S.
                    163-166.11 that would limit that statute's provisions to the narrower class of voting situations governed by the earlier enacted provisions of G.S. 163-82.15(e) would ignore the long-standing principle of statutory construction that
                    statutes relating to the same subject matter should be reconciled in such a manner as to effect the scope and meaning of the later enactment and read in a manner that would tend most completely to secure the rights of all persons affected
                    by the legislation. It was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly in enacting G.S. 163-166.11 to expand the exercise of the franchise, not to limit it or to restrict it by the terms of earlier and narrower enactments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) The State Board of Elections and all county boards of elections were following the intent of the General Assembly when they administered G.S. 163-166.11 and the earlier enacted statutes in G.S. 163-182.2(a)(4) and G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) to count in
                    whole or in part ballots cast by registered voters in the county who voted outside their resident precincts in the July 20, 2004, Primary, the August 17, 2004, Second Primary, and the November 2, 2004, General Election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(8) Several hundred thousand registered North Carolina voters cast ballots outside their resident precincts during the one-stop absentee balloting ('early voting') period pursuant to G.S. 163-227.2 prior to the General Election in November 2004, during
                    the two primaries in 2004, and then on the date of the General Election in November 2004. There is no statutory basis upon which to distinguish out-of-precinct voting that occurred on the date of the General Election in November 2004
                    from out-of-precinct voting that occurred during the First and Second Primaries in 2004 or that occurred during the period of one-stop absentee ('early') voting prior to the General Election of 2004.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(9) The General Assembly takes note of the fact that of those registered voters who happened to vote provisional ballots outside their resident precincts on the day of the November 2004 General Election, a disproportionately high percentage were African-American.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(10) The General Assembly notes that in addition to provisional voting on the date of the General Election pursuant to G.S. 163-166.11, the General Statutes abound with provisions that allow voters to cast votes outside their resident precincts:
                </p>

                    "d. Voting in a voting place on a lot adjacent to the precinct, G.S. 163-128.

                    "e. Temporarily voting in an adjacent precinct, G.S. 163-128.

                </p>
                <p>
                    "g. Voting at a central location in the county by voters who no longer live in the precinct where their name is listed on registration lists, G.S. 163-82.15(e).
                </p>
                <p>
                    "All those provisions were enacted prior to G.S. 163-166.11. Most were enacted decades before. As many as 1,000,000 people in North Carolina may have cast out-of-precinct votes using all out-of-precinct methods in 2004.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(11) It would be fundamentally unfair to discount the provisional official ballots cast by properly registered and duly qualified voters voting and acting in reliance on the statutes adopted by the General Assembly and administered by the State Board
                    of Elections in accordance with its intent. Moreover, to subtract such ballots only from the count for the General Election of 2004 without also doing so for the First or Second Primaries of 2004 would create a bizarre result in which
                    out-of-precinct provisional ballots are allowed to count for some elections but not others. The General Assembly did not and does not now intend to create such a system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(12) Even if the State Board of Elections had misread the language and intent of the General Statutes concerning provisional voting, which it did not do, it has been the long-standing and hitherto unquestioned law of this State, confirmed by prior decisions
                    of the North Carolina Supreme Court, that an innocent voter's ballot shall not be disqualified because of errors or omissions by elections officials. This fundamental principle was adopted by Justice Samuel J. Ervin Jr. in the case
                    of
                    <i>
    Owens v. Chaplin,

                <p>
                    'We can conceive of no principle which permits the disfranchisement of innocent voters for the mistake, or even the willful misconduct, of election officials in performing the duty cast upon them. The object of elections is to ascertain the popular will,
                    and not to thwart it. The object of election laws is to secure the rights of duly-qualified electors, and not to defeat them.'

                    "(13) It is the will of the people, as expressed through their representatives in the General Assembly, that the validity of the primaries and elections conducted in 2004 and certified by a county board of elections or the State Board of Elections, not
                    be called into question by retroactively revisiting the propriety of provisional ballots cast by duly registered voters of a county.

                    of the forms of photo identification appropriate for voting. If that voter indicates he or she does not have one or more of the types of photo identification appropriate for voting, that voter shall be asked to sign an acknowledgment
                    of the photo identification requirement and be given a list of types of photo identification appropriate for voting and information on how to obtain those types of photo identification. The list of names of those voters who signed

        Constitutionality.
       </b> - District court clearly erred in ignoring or dismissing the historical background evidence, refusing to draw the obvious inference from the sequence of events leading to passage of 2013 N.C. Sess. Laws 381, and refusing
                        to acknowledge the import of the undisputed impact of the challenged provisions. After assessing the Arlington Heights factors, the appellate court concluded that provisions requiring photo ID, reducing the days of early voting,
                        and eliminating same-day registration, out-of-precinct voting, and preregistration were enacted with racially discriminatory intent in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and

                    shall not be counted; and the container-return envelope shall not be opened but shall be marked "Challenge Sustained." All envelopes so marked shall be preserved intact by the chairman for a period of six months from canvass day or

                        Findings of Fact. - Although the finding of fact of a county board of elections (BOE) regarding a town council member's address on file with the North Carolina Real Estate Commission was without sufficient evidentiary basis in the record, there was no
                        prejudicial error since the BOE order finding that the member was ineligible to vote in the town was supported by other competent and substantial evidence in light of the whole record. Rotruck v. Guilford Cty. Bd. of Elections,
                        <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 833 S.E.2d 345 (2019).

                        Evidence. - Any error resulting from a county board of elections' consideration of an email, in which a witness told a town council member he voted in one town in 2016 and a second town in 2017, was harmless and could not be the basis for reversal of
                        the order finding him ineligible to vote in the second town because he testified that he was registered to vote and did vote in the first town; the record contained his registration to vote in the second town, and the exhibit merely
                        corroborated other evidence. Rotruck v. Guilford Cty. Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 833 S.E.2d 345 (2019).

                        Constitutional Challenges. - Libertarian party's current status as a recognized political party through the 2012 general election did not exempt it from its obligation to continue to satisfy the requirement of G.S. 163-96(a)(1) in order to retain its
                        recognition, or from its obligation to satisfy the two percent petition requirement of G.S. 163-96(a)(2) in the event that it is unable to retain its recognition as a political party; additionally, in the event that the party was
                        required to satisfy the two percent petition requirement set forth in G.S. 163-96(a)(2) but failed to do so by the June preceding the first general state election in which the new political party desired to participate, the five
                        or six months during which the party could bring a similar action challenging the constitutionality of the requirements of G.S. 163-96(a)(1) and (2) would be too short to allow the matter to be fully litigated prior to the next
                        election; therefore, the party's appeal was not moot. Libertarian Party of N.C. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 688 S.E.2d 700 (2009), aff'd in part and modified in part,

        Ballot Access Rules Constitutional.

                    <p>
                        While North Carolina's ballot access scheme inevitably burdened the associational rights of members of small parties as well as the informational interests of all voters regardless of their party affiliation, it also found that associational rights were
                        not absolute and were necessarily subject to qualification if elections were to be run fairly and effectively. Because a legislative enactment had to be upheld unless its unconstitutionality clearly and unmistakably appeared beyond
                        a reasonable doubt or it could not be upheld on any reasonable ground, the appellate court held that G.S. 163-96(a)(2) was not violative of N.C. Const., Art. I,

                        Deadline for new political parties to submit petitions for verification to county boards of election did not severely burden the parties' constitutional rights since the deadline provided ample time and opportunity to collect the required reasonable number
                        of signatures and furthered the state's interests in timely verification of signatures and preparation of the ballot. Pisano v. Strach, 743 F.3d 927 (4th Cir. 2014).

        Mandatory Ballot Petition Language Constitutional.
       </b> - The State's mandatory ballot petition language in subsection (b) is not unconstitutional merely because it could conceivably mislead some individuals and could have been crafted more adroitly, because either the factfinder
                        must be persuaded that protected expressive, political, and associational rights have in fact been invaded, or the court must be able to conclude as a matter of law that such is the inevitable consequence. McLaughlin v. North Carolina

                        <b>
        Discrimination Against Independent Candidates Unconstitutional.
       </b> - North Carolina grossly discriminated against those who chose to pursue their candidacies as independents rather than by forming a new political party in requiring a group of voters seeking a place on the ballot as
                        a new party to submit petitions signed by only 10,000 voters, less than one sixteenth the number required of an independent candidate, and furthermore, in requiring a candidate desiring to run in the North Carolina Presidential
                        Preference Primary to submit only 10,000 signatures; since the State asserted no compelling interest for such disparate treatment, that portion of G.S. 163-122 which required an independent candidate for president to file written
                        petitions signed by qualified voters equal in number to 10 percent of those who voted for Governor in the last gubernatorial election was an unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of such candidate and his supporters to
                        associate for the advancement of political beliefs, to cast their votes effectively, and to enjoy equal protection under law. Greaves v. State Bd. of Elections, 508 F. Supp. 78 (E.D.N.C. 1980), decided prior to 1981 amendment to
                        G.S. 163-122.

        Signature Verification Fee and Notarization Requirement Unconstitutional.
       </b> - The dual combination of the signature verification fee and the notarization requirement clearly, unduly burdens minor party resources and violates equal protection. The State should be enjoined from enforcing the
                        fourth paragraph of this section and the further requirement that the county board of elections "shall require a fee of five cents (5

        Injunction against Requirement That Petition Signatories Become Party Members.
       </b> - The State Board of Elections was enjoined from enforcing portions of subsection (b) of this section against a new political party which required its petitions for 1982 ballot positions to contain a clause to the effect
                        that any signatories to the petition would automatically become members of the new party despite other affiliations. The Board was enjoined as the party's likelihood of success in challenging the subsection's legality under U.S.

                    the forms of judicial selection with multiple committees considering various proposals of selection and new judicial district maps. The General Assembly finds that, to allow for more time to thoughtfully consider these changes, the
                    General Assembly enacted S.L. 2017-214, the Electoral Freedom Act of 2017, which, among other items, provided for a one-time cancellation of partisan primaries for the offices of district court judge, superior court judge, judges of
                    the Court of Appeals, and Supreme Court justices for the 2018 election cycle. The General Assembly finds that all elections for judges in 2018 were to be treated uniformly under S.L. 2017-214, the Electoral Freedom Act of 2017, while
                    those changes were considered.

                    ballot language above the sections of 2018 general election ballots regarding these impacted offices setting forth the listed party affiliation of a candidate at least 90 days prior to the time of filing, consistent with G.S. 163A-973,

                        Primary and Regular Elections Distinguished. - There is a well-defined distinction between a primary election and a regular election. A primary election is a means provided by law whereby members of a political party select by ballot candidates or nominees
                        for office, whereas a regular election is a means whereby officers are elected and public offices are filled according to established rules of law. In short, a primary election is merely a mode of choosing candidates of political
                        parties, whereas a regular election is the final choice of the entire electorate. Rider v. Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 620</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 913 (1953); Ponder v. Joslin, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 496</cite>,

                        By requiring candidates to shoulder the costs of conducting primary elections through filing fees and by providing no reasonable alternative means of access to the ballot, the State erected a system that utilized the criterion of ability to pay as a condition
                        to being on the ballot, thus excluding some candidates otherwise qualified and denying an undetermined number of voters the opportunity to vote for candidates of their choice. Brown v. North Carolina State Bd. of Elections, 394

                                so ascertained shall be a substantial plurality, and the aspirant who obtains a substantial plurality shall be declared the nominee. If two candidates receive a substantial plurality, the candidate receiving the highest
                                vote shall be declared the nominee.

                                number of positions to be filled, and by multiplying the result by thirty percent (30%). Any excess of the sum so ascertained shall be a substantial plurality, and the aspirants who obtain a substantial plurality shall
                                be declared the nominees. If more candidates obtain a substantial plurality than there are positions to be filled, those having the highest vote (equal to the number of positions to be filled) shall be declared the nominees.

                        Effect of Failure to Make Timely Request for Second Primary. - Under G.S. 24 of the State Primary Law, c. 101, Laws of 1915, providing, among other things, that the successful candidate for certain offices should receive a majority of the votes cast,
                        when construed in connection with the proviso of the same section that the one receiving the next highest vote, under a majority, should file a request in writing with the appropriate board of elections for a second primary, entitled
                        the one receiving the highest number of votes to be the candidate of the party to the office, upon the failure of the one receiving the next highest vote to comply with the provision within the time stated. Johnston v. Board of

                        Enforcement of Board's Duty by Mandamus. - Where a candidate for membership in the General Assembly who received the next highest vote in a legalized primary, but less than a majority of the votes cast, failed to give written notice to the board of elections
                        for a second primary within the time prescribed, and after duly declaring the result of the election the board ordered the second primary, the board's ministerial duty of recognizing the one receiving the highest vote as the candidate
                        and putting his name on the ticket as such would be enforced by mandamus. Johnston v. Board of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 162</cite>, 90 S.E. 143 (1916).

                        Showing Required of Plaintiff Seeking Mandamus. - The plaintiff in proceedings for mandamus to compel county board of elections to declare him the successful candidate of his party in a primary election or to declare that he was entitled to a second primary
                        involving himself and another candidate for the same office must show the denial of a present, clear legal right by the failure of such board to have done so. Umstead v. Board of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 139</cite>,

                        In order for a candidate for the party nomination for the legislature to obtain a writ of mandamus against the county board of elections to compel the ordering of a second primary, he must show that his opponents, who received the larger number of votes
                        did not receive a majority of the votes cast for said nomination, and he must have timely filed with the county board of elections a written request that the second primary be called by it. Umstead v. Board of Elections,

        Ten Percent Requirement for Independent Candidates Held Unconstitutional.
       </b> - North Carolina grossly discriminated against those who chose to pursue their candidacies as independents rather than by forming a new political party in requiring a group of voters seeking a place on the ballot as
                        a new party to submit petitions signed by only 10,000 voters, less than one sixteenth the number required of an independent candidate, and furthermore, in requiring a candidate desiring to run in the North Carolina Presidential
                        Preference Primary to submit only 10,000 signatures; since the State asserted no compelling interest for such disparate treatment, that portion of subsection (1) of this section which required an independent candidate for president
                        to file written petitions signed by qualified voters equal in number to 10 percent of those who voted for Governor in the last gubernatorial election was an unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of such candidate and his
                        supporters to associate for the advancement of political beliefs, to cast their votes effectively, and to enjoy equal protection under law. Greaves v. State Bd. of Elections, 508 F. Supp. 78 (E.D.N.C. 1980), decided prior to 1981

        Justiciability of Candidate's Challenges to Filing Deadline and Petition Requirements.
       </b> - Challenge to the filing deadline under G.S. 163-122 as applied, based on the extension of the deadline due to the postponement of a statewide primary, was denied as non-justiciable because a candidate and his supporters
                        did not suffer an actual injury and there was no live controversy; however, a challenge to the statute's petition strictures was justiciable as meeting the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception to mootness, but
                        the evidence on the record was not sufficient to examine the question on summary judgment. Delaney v. Bartlett, - F. Supp. 2d - (M.D.N.C. Dec. 24, 2003).

        Filing Deadline Held Unconstitutional.
       </b> - The former filing deadline contained in this section, requiring an independent candidate's petition to be submitted by the last Friday in April before the general election, did not serve a compelling state interest
                        and was an unconstitutional restriction on the rights of independent candidates and their supporters to associate for the advancement of political beliefs, to cast their votes effectively, and to enjoy equal protection under law,
                        since such deadline did not protect the integrity of the ballot and resulted in disparate treatment of independent and party candidates. Greaves v. State Bd. of Elections, 508 F. Supp. 78 (E.D.N.C. 1980), decided prior to 1981

                    <p>
                        Because this section totally prohibits the "sore loser" from running as an independent, former early filing deadline for independent candidates (the last Friday in April before the general election) could not be said to be "necessary" to the accomplishment
                        of the same goal. Greaves v. State Bd. of Elections, 508 F. Supp. 78 (E.D.N.C. 1980), decided prior to 1981 amendment.

                    under G.S. 163-182.4(b)" for "comprising all or part of two or more counties" and "that applicant's" for "his" in the first sentence, is effective August 19, 2007.

                    In addition to the definitions stated below, the definitions set forth in Article 15A of this Chapter also apply to this Part. As used in this Part:

                        "Ballot" means an instrument on which a voter indicates that voter's choice for a ballot item so that it may be recorded as a vote for or against a certain candidate or referendum proposal, and is evidenced by an individual paper document that bears marks
                        made by the voter by hand or through electronic means, whether preprinted or printed in the voting enclosure.

                        "Ballot style" means the version of a ballot within a jurisdiction that an individual voter is eligible to vote. For example, in a county that uses essentially the same official ballot, a group office such as county commissioner may be divided into districts
                        so that different voters in the same county vote for commissioner in different districts. The different versions of the county's official ballot containing only those district ballot items one individual voter may vote are the
                        county's different ballot styles.

        Procedure for Election of Superior Court Judges Upheld.
       </b> - A superior court judge is a hybrid official with both local and statewide functions and authority, and there is a reasonable basis for election procedure requiring him to be nominated in the primary election and elected
                        in the general election by statewide vote, which serves and achieves a legitimate state purpose and is not arbitrary and capricious. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L.

                        Requiring regular superior court judges to be nominated in the primary election by districts and elected in the general election by statewide vote does not deny equal protection of the laws. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd,
                        409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).

        The one man, one vote rule does not apply to the state judiciary,
       </b> and therefore a mere showing of a disparity among the voters or in the population figures of the district would not be sufficient to strike down the election procedure for superior court judges. A showing of an arbitrary
                        and capricious or invidious action or distinction between citizens and voters would be required. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).

        Procedure for Election of Superior Court Judges Upheld.
       </b> - A superior court judge is a hybrid official with both local and statewide functions and authority, and there is a reasonable basis for election procedure requiring him to be nominated in the primary election and elected
                        in the general election by statewide vote, which serves and achieves a legitimate state purpose and is not arbitrary and capricious. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L.

       Instant Runoff Voting Pilot Program
      </b> - Session Laws 2006-192, s. 1(a) and (b), provides: "(a) The State Board of Elections shall select local jurisdictions in which to conduct a pilot program during the 2007 and 2008 elections for local offices using instant
                    runoff voting. The State Board shall select:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Up to 10 cities for the 2007 elections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Up to 10 counties for the 2008 elections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In selecting those local jurisdictions, the State Board shall seek diversity of population size, regional location, and demographic composition. The pilot shall be conducted only with the concurrence of the county board of elections that conducts elections
                    for the local jurisdiction. If a city is selected that has voters in more than one county, the concurrence of all the county boards of elections that conduct that city's elections is required. The pilot program shall consist of using
                    instant runoff voting as the method for determining the winner or winners of a partisan primary or a nonpartisan election that normally uses nonpartisan election and runoff or nonpartisan primary and election. Instant runoff voting
                    may also be used to determine results in an election where nonpartisan plurality elections are normally used, but only if the governing board of the local jurisdiction concurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "As used in this section, 'instant runoff voting' means a system in which voters rank up to three of the candidates by order of preference, first, second, or third. If the candidate with the most first-choice votes receives the threshold of victory of
                    the first-choice votes, that candidate wins. If no candidate receives the threshold of victory of first-choice votes, the two candidates with the greatest number of first-choice votes advance to a second round of counting. In this
                    round, each ballot counts as a vote for whichever of the two final candidates is ranked highest by the voter. The candidate with the most votes in the second round wins the election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The threshold of victory of first-choice votes for a partisan primary shall be forty percent (40%) plus one vote. The threshold of victory for a nonpartisan election and runoff or nonpartisan primary and election shall be a majority of the vote. The
                    threshold of victory in a contest that normally uses nonpartisan plurality shall be determined by the State Board with the concurrence of the county board of elections and the local governing board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If more than one seat is to be filled in the same race, the voter votes the same way as if one seat were to be filled. The counting is the same as when one seat is to be filled, with one or two rounds as needed, except that counting is done separately
                    for each seat to be filled. The first counting results in the first winner. Then the second count proceeds without the name of the first winner. This process results in the second winner. For each additional seat to be filled, an additional
                    count is done without the names of the candidates who have already won.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Other details of instant runoff voting are as described in House Bill 1024 (First Edition) of the 2005 Regular Session of the General Assembly, with modifications the State Board deems necessary, in primaries and/or elections for city offices, for county
                    offices, or for both. Those modifications may include giving the voter more than three choices in case of multi-seat contests. The State Board shall not use instant runoff voting in a primary or election for an office unless the entire
                    electorate for the office uses the same method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) The State Board of Elections shall closely monitor the pilot program established in this section and report its findings and recommendations to the 2007 General Assembly."

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2008-150, s. 3(a), as amended by Session Laws 2009-541, s. 30(a), provides: "The State Board of Elections is authorized to select elections for offices of local government in which to use instant runoff voting in up to 10 local jurisdictions
                    in each of the following years: 2009, 2010, and 2011. The selection of jurisdictions and administration of instant runoff voting shall follow the provisions of Section 1(a) of Session Law 2006-192, except that the local governing board
                    that is the subject of the election must approve participation in the pilot and must hold at least one public hearing on the pilot before approving it, with notice of the hearing published at least 10 days before the hearing. The local
                    governing board also must agree to cooperate with the county board of elections and the Board in the development and implementation of a plan to educate candidates and voters about how to use the runoff voting method. In a multiseat
                    contest, the Board shall modify the method used for instant runoff voting in single-seat contests to apply its essential principles suitably to that election. In the case of a board of education election where the 'local governing
                    board' must be asked to authorize instant runoff voting because nonpartisan plurality elections are normally used, the 'local governing board' is the board of education itself. If instant runoff voting is used in place of the nonpartisan
                    election and runoff method as described in G.S. 163-293, the county board of elections, with the approval of the local governing board, may hold the election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The State Board

                    The county board of elections shall make available for each precinct voting place an adequate quantity of official ballots or equipment. When the board of county commissioners has decided to adopt and purchase or lease a voting system for voting places
                    under the provisions of G.S. 165-165.8 [G.S. 163-165.8], the board of county commissioners shall, as soon as practical, provide for each of those voting places sufficient equipment of the approved voting system in complete working
                    order. If it is impractical to furnish each voting place with the equipment of the approved voting system, that which has been obtained may be placed in voting places chosen by the county board of elections. In that case, the county
                    board of elections shall choose the voting places and allocate the equipment in a way that as nearly as practicable provides equal access to the voting system for each voter. The county board of elections shall appoint as many voting
                    system custodians as may be necessary for the proper preparation of the system for each election and for its maintenance, storage, and care. The Executive Director of the State Board of Elections may permit a county board of elections
                    to provide more than one type of voting system in a precinct, but only upon a finding that doing so is necessary to comply with federal or State law.

                    <p>
                        Right of Voter to Make Ballot Public. - The provision of the State Constitution providing that elections by the people shall be by ballot (see N.C. Const., Art. VI,
                        <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 5) means that the elector has the right to put his ballot in the box and to refuse to disclose for whom he voted, but this privilege of voting a secret ballot is entirely a personal one. Hence, the voter has the right
                        at the time of voting to voluntarily make his ballot public. Jenkins v. State Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. 169</cite>, 104 S.E. 346 (1920).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Election Held Not Vitiated by Short Absence of Officer in Charge. - Fact that one of the officers appointed to conduct an election was absent a short time from the polls, during which time no vote was cast and the ballot boxes were not tampered with,
                        nor was any opportunity afforded for tampering with them, did not vitiate election. State ex rel. DeBerry v. Nicholson, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 465</cite>, 9 S.E. 545 (1889).

                    <p>
                        Inquiry as to Voter's Qualifications Rests with Election Officials. - The law does not contemplate that a watcher or any other person, when he challenges a voter at the polls, may take charge and conduct a hearing with respect to the voter's right to
                        vote. The inquiry with respect to the voter's qualifications to vote rests with the election officials. Overton v. Mayor &amp; City Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 306</cite>, 116 S.E.2d 808 (1960).

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) In 2003, the General Assembly enacted S.L. 2003-226, which contained a number of changes to the State's election laws, designed in part to implement provisions of the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) in such a way as to avoid having separate
                    laws for federal and State elections and otherwise to encourage and expand the exercise of the franchise. One such enactment was codified as G.S. 163-166.11, which spells out procedures for the casting of provisional official ballots.
                    A voter's eligibility to cast a provisional official ballot depends on being a registered voter in the jurisdiction in which the voter seeks to vote. The 'jurisdiction' in which a voter in North Carolina registers to vote is the county.
                    This is the unmistakable meaning of G.S. 163-82.1 and has not heretofore been challenged or questioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) In S.L. 2003-226, the General Assembly expressly stated its intent to 'ensure that the State of North Carolina has a system for all elections that complies with the requirements for federal elections set forth in' HAVA. It was then and is now the
                    intent of the General Assembly that the provisions of HAVA be broadly construed and that they be implemented in North Carolina in a manner to ensure a unified system of federal and State elections in compliance with HAVA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that any individual who is a registered voter in a county but whose name does not appear on the official list of registered voters at the voting place at which
                    that voter appears be allowed to cast a provisional official ballot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that all provisional ballots be counted for all those ballot items for which a voter was eligible to vote. In enacting G.S. 163-166.11 in 2003, the General
                    Assembly was fully mindful of and intended to reinforce the fact that prior statutory enactments in 2001 had already recognized the right of a voter to cast a provisional ballot and to have that ballot counted for all items for which
                    that voter was eligible to vote. See G.S. 163-182.2(a)(4). Even prior to 2003, the General Statutes recognized the right of a registered voter to cast a provisional ballot and to have that ballot counted for all those items for which
                    the voter was duly qualified to vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that the State Board of Elections act in a manner that would result in a single system for federal and State elections, rather than one system for federal
                    elections and another for State elections. In enacting G.S. 163-166.11 in 2003, the General Assembly was mindful of and intended to reinforce the fact that it had already provided in 2001 in G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) that the State Board
                    of Elections would adopt rules to ensure that voters 'not clearly eligible to vote in the precinct but who seek to vote there are given proper assistance in voting a provisional official ballot or guidance to another voting place where
                    they are eligible to vote.' The possibility of out-of-precinct provisional voting was thus recognized by the General Assembly as early as 2001.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) The law regarding provisional ballots does not rest solely on G.S. 163-82.15(e), which addresses the narrow circumstance of 'Unreported Move[s] to Another Precinct Within the County.' Though that statute mentions two ways in which precinct officials
                    may process registrants, it is not exclusive. G.S. 163-82.15(e) is part of the statutory Article on voter registration, rather than on voting, and should be read in that context. It was enacted in 1994, before provisional voting was
                    codified in North Carolina. The enactment of G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) in 2001 is the authority giving the State Board of Elections the duty to apply the broader laws of provisional voting, including G.S. 163-166.11. Any reading of G.S.
                    163-166.11 that would limit that statute's provisions to the narrower class of voting situations governed by the earlier enacted provisions of G.S. 163-82.15(e) would ignore the long-standing principle of statutory construction that
                    statutes relating to the same subject matter should be reconciled in such a manner as to effect the scope and meaning of the later enactment and read in a manner that would tend most completely to secure the rights of all persons affected
                    by the legislation. It was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly in enacting G.S. 163-166.11 to expand the exercise of the franchise, not to limit it or to restrict it by the terms of earlier and narrower enactments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) The State Board of Elections and all county boards of elections were following the intent of the General Assembly when they administered G.S. 163-166.11 and the earlier enacted statutes in G.S. 163-182.2(a)(4) and G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) to count in
                    whole or in part ballots cast by registered voters in the county who voted outside their resident precincts in the July 20, 2004, Primary, the August 17, 2004, Second Primary, and the November 2, 2004, General Election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(8) Several hundred thousand registered North Carolina voters cast ballots outside their resident precincts during the one-stop absentee balloting ('early voting') period pursuant to G.S. 163-227.2 prior to the General Election in November 2004, during
                    the two primaries in 2004, and then on the date of the General Election in November 2004. There is no statutory basis upon which to distinguish out-of-precinct voting that occurred on the date of the General Election in November 2004
                    from out-of-precinct voting that occurred during the First and Second Primaries in 2004 or that occurred during the period of one-stop absentee ('early') voting prior to the General Election of 2004.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(9) The General Assembly takes note of the fact that of those registered voters who happened to vote provisional ballots outside their resident precincts on the day of the November 2004 General Election, a disproportionately high percentage were African-American.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(10) The General Assembly notes that in addition to provisional voting on the date of the General Election pursuant to G.S. 163-166.11, the General Statutes abound with provisions that allow voters to cast votes outside their resident precincts:
                </p>

                <p>
                    "All those provisions were enacted prior to G.S. 163-166.11. Most were enacted decades before. As many as 1,000,000 people in North Carolina may have cast out-of-precinct votes using all out-of-precinct methods in 2004.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(11) It would be fundamentally unfair to discount the provisional official ballots cast by properly registered and duly qualified voters voting and acting in reliance on the statutes adopted by the General Assembly and administered by the State Board
                    of Elections in accordance with its intent. Moreover, to subtract such ballots only from the count for the General Election of 2004 without also doing so for the First or Second Primaries of 2004 would create a bizarre result in which
                    out-of-precinct provisional ballots are allowed to count for some elections but not others. The General Assembly did not and does not now intend to create such a system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(12) Even if the State Board of Elections had misread the language and intent of the General Statutes concerning provisional voting, which it did not do, it has been the long-standing and hitherto unquestioned law of this State, confirmed by prior decisions
                    of the North Carolina Supreme Court, that an innocent voter's ballot shall not be disqualified because of errors or omissions by elections officials. This fundamental principle was adopted by Justice Samuel J. Ervin Jr. in the case
                    of

                    'We can conceive of no principle which permits the disfranchisement of innocent voters for the mistake, or even the willful misconduct, of election officials in performing the duty cast upon them. The object of elections is to ascertain the popular will,
                    and not to thwart it. The object of election laws is to secure the rights of duly-qualified electors, and not to defeat them.'

                    in G.S. 115D-2(2), or eligible private postsecondary institution as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.116.html#t116a34s116-280" target="_blank">G.S. 116-280(3)</a></cite> or an employee identification

                    an approved student identification card or employee identification card without a printed expiration date shall be eligible for use in any election held before January 1, 2021."

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2019-4 provides in its preamble: "Whereas, in November 2018, the voters of North Carolina approved a constitutional amendment requiring every voter offering to vote in person to present photographic identification before voting; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, the approved constitutional amendment became effective upon certification of the November 6, 2018, election results; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, the General Assembly of North Carolina enacted S.L. 2018-144 in December 2018, setting forth the general laws governing the requirements of photographic identification for voting in person and the exceptions thereto, and setting forth a time
                    line of implementation for the 2019 elections and thereafter; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, S.L. 2018-144 also contained reforms to the process of absentee voting by mail and those reforms require rule making and other implementation efforts from the State Board of Elections; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, in February 2019, the need for a special congressional election to fill a vacancy in the United States House of Representatives has arisen due to unforeseen circumstances, and the Governor has determined a schedule for such special election;
                    and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, in March 2019, the State Board of Elections issued an order to conduct a new election in a separate United States House of Representatives district and has determined a schedule for such new election; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, the schedule of the two additional elections generates concerns about the ability of the county boards of election and the State Board of Elections to ensure uniformity in the requirement to present photographic identification before voting
                    in person; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, the absentee voting by mail reforms in S.L. 2018-144 require rule making and other administrative procedures on the part of the State Board of Elections which will not be completed prior to the two additional 2019 congressional elections; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, the State Board of Elections needs legislative clarity regarding absentee voting by mail in order to conduct the two additional 2019 congressional elections in an orderly fashion; Now, therefore,"

                    This section was amended by Session Laws 2019-22, s. 3, in the coded bill drafting format provided by G.S. 120-20.1. In subdivision (a)(1), Session Laws 2019-22, s. 3 failed to strike through the word "true." In subdivision (a)(1)a., Session Laws 2019-22,
                    s. 3 failed to set out the text as enacted by Session Laws 2018-144, 1.2(c), so that the phrase "employing entity" was not struck through. Subdivision (a)(1) has been set out in the form above at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes.

                        Procedures and Standards. - The State Board of Elections shall adopt uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures and standards for voting systems. The standards shall define what constitutes a vote and what will be counted as a vote for each category of
                        voting system used in the State. The State Board shall adopt those procedures and standards at a meeting occurring not earlier than 15 days after the State Board gives notice of the meeting. The procedures and standards adopted
                        shall apply to all elections occurring in the State and shall be subject to amendment or repeal by the State Board acting at any meeting where notice that the action has been proposed has been given at least 15 days before the
                        meeting. These procedures and standards shall not be considered to be rules subject to Article 2A of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes. However, the State Board shall publish in the North Carolina Register the procedures and
                        standards and any changes to them after adoption, with that publication noted as information helpful to the public under G.S. 150B-21.17(a)(6). Copies of those procedures and standards shall be made available to the public upon
                        request or otherwise by the State Board. For optical scan and direct record electronic voting systems, and for any other voting systems in which ballots are counted other than on paper by hand and eye, those procedures and standards
                        shall do both of the following:

                                Provide for a sample hand-to-eye count of the paper ballots of a statewide ballot item in every county. The presidential ballot item shall be the subject of the sampling in a presidential election. If there is no statewide ballot item, the State Board
                                shall provide a process for selecting district or local ballot items to adequately sample the electorate. The State Board shall approve in an open meeting the procedure for randomly selecting the sample precincts for each
                                election. The random selection of precincts for any county shall be done publicly after the initial count of election returns for that county is publicly released or 24 hours after the polls close on election day, whichever
                                is earlier. The sample chosen by the State Board shall be of one or more full precincts, full counts of mailed absentee ballots, full counts of one or more one-stop early voting sites, or a combination. The size of the
                                sample of each category shall be chosen to produce a statistically significant result and shall be chosen after consultation with a statistician. The actual units shall be chosen at random. In the event of a material discrepancy
                                between the electronic or mechanical count and a hand-to-eye count, the hand-to-eye count shall control, except where paper ballots have been lost or destroyed or where there is another reasonable basis to conclude that
                                the hand-to-eye count is not the true count. If the discrepancy between the hand-to-eye count and the mechanical or electronic count is significant, a complete hand-to-eye count shall be conducted.

                        Extrinsic Evidence to Determine Voter's Choice. - If a write-in candidate's name is on the ballot, but not in exact accordance with mandatory statutory requirements, the court may look to extrinsic evidence to see if the voter's choice can be determined.

                        Evidence as to Which of Two Candidates with Same Name Intended. - If there are two candidates for different offices who have the same name, and a ticket is found in the ballot box having that name and no other on it, it may be proved by extrinsic evidence
                        for which of the candidates it was given. Wilson v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. 113</cite> (1873).

                        Ballots Held Improperly Rejected. - The statute [former G.S. 163-170] does not contemplate throwing out the whole ballot for voting one ticket for too many candidates. Hence, a ballot for one claiming the office of register of deeds, which was thrown
                        out because it contained two unmarked names, instead of one, for the office of recorder of the county, was improperly rejected as a vote for register, since the elector's choice for such office was properly indicated. Bray v. Baxter,

                    <p>
                        A ballot the only defect of which was that it contained unmarked names of four persons for the office of county commissioner, while only three commissioners were to be elected, was improperly rejected. Bray v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 6</cite>,

                                (Effective January 1, 2018) For optical scan and direct record electronic voting systems, and for any other voting systems in which ballots are counted other than on paper by hand and eye, those rules shall provide for a sample hand-to-eye count of the
                                paper ballots of a sampling of a statewide ballot item in every county. The presidential ballot item shall be the subject of the sampling in a presidential election. If there is no statewide ballot item, the State Board
                                shall provide a process for selecting district or local ballot items to adequately sample the electorate. The State Board shall approve in an open meeting the procedure for randomly selecting the sample precincts for each
                                election. The random selection of precincts for any county shall be done publicly after the initial count of election returns for that county is publicly released or 24 hours after the polls close on election day, whichever
                                is earlier. The sample chosen by the State Board shall be of one or more full precincts, full counts of mailed absentee ballots, and full counts of one or more one-stop early voting sites. The size of the sample of each
                                category shall be chosen to produce a statistically significant result and shall be chosen after consultation with a statistician. The actual units shall be chosen at random. In the event of a material discrepancy between
                                the electronic or mechanical count and a hand-to-eye count, the hand-to-eye count shall control, except where paper ballots have been lost or destroyed or where there is another reasonable basis to conclude that the hand-to-eye
                                count is not the true count. If the discrepancy between the hand-to-eye count and the mechanical or electronic count is significant, a complete hand-to-eye count shall be conducted. The sample count need not be done on

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - This section was recodified as now former G.S. 163A-1169 by Session Laws 2017-6, s. 3. Former G.S. 163A-1169 was then re-recodified as this section by Session Laws 2018-146, s. 3.1(a), effective January 31, 2019. The historical
                    citation from the former section has been added to this section as re-recodified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2005-2, s. 1, provides: "The General Assembly makes the following findings:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) In 2003, the General Assembly enacted S.L. 2003-226, which contained a number of changes to the State's election laws, designed in part to implement provisions of the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) in such a way as to avoid having separate
                    laws for federal and State elections and otherwise to encourage and expand the exercise of the franchise. One such enactment was codified as G.S. 163-166.11, which spells out procedures for the casting of provisional official ballots.
                    A voter's eligibility to cast a provisional official ballot depends on being a registered voter in the jurisdiction in which the voter seeks to vote. The 'jurisdiction' in which a voter in North Carolina registers to vote is the county.
                    This is the unmistakable meaning of G.S. 163-82.1 and has not heretofore been challenged or questioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) In S.L. 2003-226, the General Assembly expressly stated its intent to 'ensure that the State of North Carolina has a system for all elections that complies with the requirements for federal elections set forth in' HAVA. It was then and is now the
                    intent of the General Assembly that the provisions of HAVA be broadly construed and that they be implemented in North Carolina in a manner to ensure a unified system of federal and State elections in compliance with HAVA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that any individual who is a registered voter in a county but whose name does not appear on the official list of registered voters at the voting place at which
                    that voter appears be allowed to cast a provisional official ballot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that all provisional ballots be counted for all those ballot items for which a voter was eligible to vote. In enacting G.S. 163-166.11 in 2003, the General
                    Assembly was fully mindful of and intended to reinforce the fact that prior statutory enactments in 2001 had already recognized the right of a voter to cast a provisional ballot and to have that ballot counted for all items for which
                    that voter was eligible to vote. See G.S. 163-182.2(a)(4). Even prior to 2003, the General Statutes recognized the right of a registered voter to cast a provisional ballot and to have that ballot counted for all those items for which
                    the voter was duly qualified to vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) When it enacted G.S. 163-166.11, it was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly that the State Board of Elections act in a manner that would result in a single system for federal and State elections, rather than one system for federal
                    elections and another for State elections. In enacting G.S. 163-166.11 in 2003, the General Assembly was mindful of and intended to reinforce the fact that it had already provided in 2001 in G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) that the State Board
                    of Elections would adopt rules to ensure that voters 'not clearly eligible to vote in the precinct but who seek to vote there are given proper assistance in voting a provisional official ballot or guidance to another voting place where
                    they are eligible to vote.' The possibility of out-of-precinct provisional voting was thus recognized by the General Assembly as early as 2001.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) The law regarding provisional ballots does not rest solely on G.S. 163-82.15(e), which addresses the narrow circumstance of 'Unreported Move[s] to Another Precinct Within the County.' Though that statute mentions two ways in which precinct officials
                    may process registrants, it is not exclusive. G.S. 163-82.15(e) is part of the statutory Article on voter registration, rather than on voting, and should be read in that context. It was enacted in 1994, before provisional voting was
                    codified in North Carolina. The enactment of G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) in 2001 is the authority giving the State Board of Elections the duty to apply the broader laws of provisional voting, including G.S. 163-166.11. Any reading of G.S.
                    163-166.11 that would limit that statute's provisions to the narrower class of voting situations governed by the earlier enacted provisions of G.S. 163-82.15(e) would ignore the long-standing principle of statutory construction that
                    statutes relating to the same subject matter should be reconciled in such a manner as to effect the scope and meaning of the later enactment and read in a manner that would tend most completely to secure the rights of all persons affected
                    by the legislation. It was then and is now the intent of the General Assembly in enacting G.S. 163-166.11 to expand the exercise of the franchise, not to limit it or to restrict it by the terms of earlier and narrower enactments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) The State Board of Elections and all county boards of elections were following the intent of the General Assembly when they administered G.S. 163-166.11 and the earlier enacted statutes in G.S. 163-182.2(a)(4) and G.S. 163-166.7(c)(6) to count in
                    whole or in part ballots cast by registered voters in the county who voted outside their resident precincts in the July 20, 2004, Primary, the August 17, 2004, Second Primary, and the November 2, 2004, General Election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(8) Several hundred thousand registered North Carolina voters cast ballots outside their resident precincts during the one-stop absentee balloting ('early voting') period pursuant to G.S. 163-227.2 prior to the General Election in November 2004, during
                    the two primaries in 2004, and then on the date of the General Election in November 2004. There is no statutory basis upon which to distinguish out-of-precinct voting that occurred on the date of the General Election in November 2004
                    from out-of-precinct voting that occurred during the First and Second Primaries in 2004 or that occurred during the period of one-stop absentee ('early') voting prior to the General Election of 2004.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(9) The General Assembly takes note of the fact that of those registered voters who happened to vote provisional ballots outside their resident precincts on the day of the November 2004 General Election, a disproportionately high percentage were African-American.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(10) The General Assembly notes that in addition to provisional voting on the date of the General Election pursuant to G.S. 163-166.11, the General Statutes abound with provisions that allow voters to cast votes outside their resident precincts:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "a. Civilian absentee voting by mail, G.S. 163-226.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "b. Military and overseas citizens absentee voting, G.S. 163-245.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "c. One-stop absentee (early) voting, G.S. 163-227.2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "d. Voting in a voting place on a lot adjacent to the precinct, G.S. 163-128.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "e. Temporarily voting in an adjacent precinct, G.S. 163-128.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "f. Voting in a precinct outside the voting place where no suitable facility exists inside it or adjacent to it, G.S. 163-130.1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "g. Voting at a central location in the county by voters who no longer live in the precinct where their name is listed on registration lists, G.S. 163-82.15(e).
                </p>
                <p>
                    "All those provisions were enacted prior to G.S. 163-166.11. Most were enacted decades before. As many as 1,000,000 people in North Carolina may have cast out-of-precinct votes using all out-of-precinct methods in 2004.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(11) It would be fundamentally unfair to discount the provisional official ballots cast by properly registered and duly qualified voters voting and acting in reliance on the statutes adopted by the General Assembly and administered by the State Board
                    of Elections in accordance with its intent. Moreover, to subtract such ballots only from the count for the General Election of 2004 without also doing so for the First or Second Primaries of 2004 would create a bizarre result in which
                    out-of-precinct provisional ballots are allowed to count for some elections but not others. The General Assembly did not and does not now intend to create such a system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(12) Even if the State Board of Elections had misread the language and intent of the General Statutes concerning provisional voting, which it did not do, it has been the long-standing and hitherto unquestioned law of this State, confirmed by prior decisions
                    of the North Carolina Supreme Court, that an innocent voter's ballot shall not be disqualified because of errors or omissions by elections officials. This fundamental principle was adopted by Justice Samuel J. Ervin Jr. in the case
                    of
                    <i>
    Owens v. Chaplin,
   </i>
                    <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 705</cite> (1948) using the following language:
                </p>
                <p>
                    'We can conceive of no principle which permits the disfranchisement of innocent voters for the mistake, or even the willful misconduct, of election officials in performing the duty cast upon them. The object of elections is to ascertain the popular will,
                    and not to thwart it. The object of election laws is to secure the rights of duly-qualified electors, and not to defeat them.'

                <p>
                    "(13) It is the will of the people, as expressed through their representatives in the General Assembly, that the validity of the primaries and elections conducted in 2004 and certified by a county board of elections or the State Board of Elections, not
                    be called into question by retroactively revisiting the propriety of provisional ballots cast by duly registered voters of a county.

                        the county board had the authority, in the exercise of its judgment and discretion in good faith, to order and conduct a recount of the ballots cast and to certify the candidate having the majority of the votes as ascertained by
                        such recount as the nominee of the party, notwithstanding that the returns of the precinct officials were regular upon their face. Strickland v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 198</cite>, 116 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Access to Ballot Boxes. - Former version of G.S. 163-143, similar to the last paragraph of this section [former G.S. 163-175], applied only "when, on account of errors in tabulating returns or filling out blanks," the result of the election could not
                        be accurately known, and conferred no authority on the courts to investigate and pass upon the methods or manner in which the primary might have been conducted. Brown v. Costen, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 63</cite>,
                        96 S.E. 659 (1918).

                    <p>
                        Returns made by the precinct officials constitute only a preliminary step in ascertaining the results of an election, and such returns must be canvassed and declared by the board of canvassers (now the board of elections) as an essential part of the election
                        machinery. Ledwell v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 161</cite>, 19 S.E.2d 234 (1942).

                    <p>
                        Correction of Tabulations by Registrar and Judges of Election. - In a primary for county officers, the registrar (now chief judge) and judges of election may correct their tabulation of the results to the county board of elections before the latter has
                        judicially determined the results, as the duties of the latter board are continuous, and such powers are not functus officio until they have finally determined the results of the election. Bell v. County Bd. of Elections,

                    <p>
                        Supplementary Returns After Adjournments of Registrar and Judges. - Additional or supplemental returns made up by the county board of canvassers (now the county board of elections) after the registrar and poll holders (now the chief judge and judges)
                        had fully performed their duties and adjourned, and without calling them together for reconsideration as a body, should not be given effect by the courts. Britt v. Board of Canvassers, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 797</cite>,
                        90 S.E. 1005 (1916).

                    <p>
                        Result as Declared by Board Prima Facie Correct. - There is a final and conclusive presumption in favor of the correctness of the result of an election, as declared by the proper officials, until the issues raised by the pleadings have been tried and
                        disposed of before the jury. Wallace v. Salisbury, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. 58</cite>, 60 S.E. 713 (1908).

                    <p>
                        The finding by the board of canvassers (now the county board of elections) as to the number of votes received by a contestant in an election is prima facie correct. State ex rel. Jones v. Flynt, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. 87</cite>,

                        In proceedings in the nature of a quo warranto to determine the respective rights of the parties contesting for an office, the result of the election, as declared by the county board of canvassers (now the county board of elections), must be taken as
                        prima facie correct. State ex rel. Robertson v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 695</cite>, 110 S.E. 593 (1922).

                    <p>
                        Decisions of Board Subject to Collateral Attack. - The decisions or judgments of the county board of canvassers (now the county board of elections) are not of such conclusiveness or finality as to exclude collateral attack, and the use of the word "judicially"
                        in the statute [former G.S. 163-175] does not affect the construction. State ex rel. Barnett v. Midgett, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 1</cite>, 65 S.E. 441 (1909).

                    <p>
                        Quo Warranto as Remedy to Determine Correctness of Election Result. - The correctness of the result of the election of a clerk of the superior court, determined and declared by the county board of canvassers (now the county board of elections), can be
                        investigated, passed upon and determined in a civil action in the nature of a quo warranto, and such is the proper remedy. State ex rel. Barnett v. Midgett, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 1</cite>, 65 S.E.

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction of Superior Court in Quo Warranto. - The act of the county canvassers (now the county board of elections) in declaring the result of an election to public office cannot have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the superior court in
                        quo warranto or information in the nature thereof. Harkrader v. Lawrence, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 441</cite>, 130 S.E. 35 (1925).

                    <p>
                        Mandamus by Candidate. - Where county board of elections has assumed to pass upon the qualifications of the electors voting in a primary for the selection of a party candidate for a county office, and in so doing has declared certain of the electors disqualified
                        and has accordingly changed its returns and declared the one appearing to have received a smaller vote as the choice of the party as a candidate, an action will lie by the one appearing to have received the larger vote against
                        the county board, to compel them, by mandamus, to tabulate the returns made by the registrars (now chief judges) and judges of the precinct, and then to publish and declare the same as the result of the election. Rowland v. Board
                        of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 78</cite>, 113 S.E. 629 (1922).

                    <p>
                        State Board of Elections has general supervision over primaries and elections in the State, with authority to promulgate legally consistent rules and regulations for their conduct and to compel the observance of the election laws by county boards of election.
                        Burgin v. North Carolina State Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 140</cite>, 198 S.E. 592 (1938).

                    <p>
                        Supervisory Power Not Affected by Canvassing Duties. - The duty of the State Board to canvass returns and declare the count does not affect its supervisory power, which perforce must be exercised prior to the final acceptance of the returns made by the
                        county boards. Burgin v. North Carolina State Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 140</cite>, 198 S.E. 592 (1938).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that, after the returns are in, the State Board of Elections is to canvass the returns and determine who has been nominated or elected is not to be construed as a denial or negation of its supervisory powers, which perforce are to be exercised
                        prior to the final acceptance of the several returns. Ponder v. Joslin, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 496</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 143 (1964).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Canvass of Primary Returns in Multi-County Senatorial District. - The State Board of Elections is the appropriate agency to canvass and judicially declare the results of a primary for the nomination of a candidate in a senatorial district composed of
                        more than one county. A county board of elections in a multiple county senatorial district has no such power. Ponder v. Joslin, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 496</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 143 (1964).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The courts will not undertake to control the State Board in exercising its duty of general supervision so long as such supervision conforms to the rudiments of fair play and the statutes on the subject. Ponder v. Joslin,
                        <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 496</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 143 (1964).

                    <p>
                        Review of State Board's Decision. - When the State Board of Elections obtained jurisdiction of an election protest upon an appeal from a single county in a multiple county senatorial district, or by the filing in apt time of a protest directly with the
                        State Board of Elections, its decision could only be reviewed in the manner prescribed by former G.S. 143-306 et seq. (now repealed). Ponder v. Joslin, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 496</cite>, 138 S.E.2d

                        Preliminary Consideration. - The following principles shall apply to the initial consideration of election protests by the county board of elections:

                            <li id="t163a15As163-182.10ol1a1">
                                The county board shall, as soon as possible after the protest is filed, meet to determine whether the protest substantially complies with G.S. 163-182.9 and whether it establishes probable cause to believe that a violation of election law or irregularity
                                or misconduct has occurred. If the board determines that one or both requirements are not met, the board shall dismiss the protest. The board shall notify both the protester and the State Board of Elections. The protester
                                may file an amended protest or may appeal to the State Board. If the board determines that both requirements are met, it shall schedule a hearing.

                            <li id="t163a15As163-182.10ol1a2">
                                If a protest was filed before the canvass and concerns the counting and tabulating of votes, the county board shall resolve the protest before the canvass is completed. If necessary to provide time to resolve the protest, the county board may recess the
                                canvass meeting, but shall not delay the completion of the canvass for more than three days unless approved by the State Board of Elections. Resolution of the protest shall not delay the canvass of ballot items unaffected
                                by the protest. The appeal of a dismissal shall not delay the canvass.

                        Notice of Hearing. - The county board shall give notice of the protest hearing to the protester, any candidate likely to be affected, any election official alleged to have acted improperly, and those persons likely to have a significant interest in the
                        resolution of the protest. Each person given notice shall also be given a copy of the protest or a summary of its allegations. The manner of notice shall be as follows:

                            <li id="t163a15As163-182.10ol1b1">
                                If the protest concerns the manner in which the votes were counted or the results tabulated, the protester shall be told at the time of filing that the protest will be heard at the time of the canvass. Others shall be notified as far in advance of the
                                canvass as time permits.

                                The county board may receive evidence at the hearing from any person with information concerning the subject of the protest. The person who made the protest shall be permitted to present allegations and introduce evidence at the hearing. Any other person
                                to whom notice of hearing was given, if present, shall be permitted to present evidence. The board may allow evidence by affidavit. The board may permit evidence to be presented by a person to whom notice was not given,
                                if the person apparently has a significant interest in the resolution of the protest that is not adequately represented by other participants.

                <p>
                    The State Board of Elections may consider protests that were not filed in compliance with G.S. 163-182.9, may initiate and consider complaints on its own motion, may intervene and take jurisdiction over protests pending before a county board, and may
                    take any other action necessary to assure that an election is determined without taint of fraud or corruption and without irregularities that may have changed the result of an election. Where a known group of voters cast votes that
                    were lost beyond retrieval or where a known group of voters was given an incorrect ballot style, the State Board of Elections may authorize a county board of elections to allow those voters to recast their votes during a period of
                    two weeks after the canvass by the State Board of Elections required in G.S. 163-182.5(c). If there is no State Board canvass after the election, the State Board may authorize the county board to allow the recasting of votes during
                    the two weeks after the county canvass set in G.S. 163-182.5(a). If the State Board approves a recasting of votes under this section, any procedures the county board uses to contact those voters and allow them to recast their votes
                    shall be subject to approval by the State Board. Those recast votes shall be added to the returns and included in the canvass. The recasting of those votes shall not be deemed a new election for purposes of G.S. 163-182.13.

                    Cromartie v. Hunt, 34 F. Supp. 2d 1029 (E.D.N.C. 1998), held that G.S. 163-201(a), as amended by Session Laws 1997-11, s. 1, was unconstitutional. Session Laws 1998-2, s. 1, adopted a redistricting plan in response, but s. 1.1 provided that the plan adopted
                    in s. 1 was effective for elections in years 1998 and 2000 unless the United States Supreme Court reversed the decision of the District Court holding G.S. 163-201(a) unconstitutional. The decision of the District Court was reversed
                    by the United States Supreme Court in Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 119 S. Ct. 1545, 143 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1999).

                    Session Laws 1998-164, s. 1(a), established a special reserve fund, "Reserve for Attorneys Fees in the Case of Pope v. Hunt," in the Office of State Budget and Management to compensate the law firm of Maupin Taylor &amp; Ellis, P.A., for its representation
                    of Art Pope and others in the case of Pope v. Hunt, (see Shaw v. Hunt, 154 F.3d 161 (4th Cir. 1998)), which challenged the congressional redistricting plan adopted by the 1991 General Assembly. Section 1(b) appropriated $550,000 from
                    the General Fund to the Office of State Budget and Management for fiscal year 1998-99, and provided that the Director of the Budget allocate the funds pursuant to the order entered in that case. Section 1(c) provided that any funds
                    remaining in the reserve after the firm of Maupin Taylor &amp; Ellis, P.A., has been compensated are to revert to the General Fund.

                    Session Laws 2011-414, s. 1, provides: "The General Assembly makes the following findings:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) On July 28, 2011, the General Assembly enacted Session Law 2011-403 to realign the United States Congressional districts following the return of the 2010 federal decennial Census.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Session Law 2011-403, Rucho Lewis Congress 3, was drafted with the assistance of computer software designed to convert the map and supporting block assignment file to a textual explanation of the districts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) Due to a coding error in the computer software, certain Census blocks were not assigned to any district in the textual explanation of Session Law 2011-403.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) G.S. 163-201(d), as enacted by Session Law 2011-403, provides for assignment of unassigned areas, and that language results in total population deviations outside of the range intended by the General Assembly in July 2011.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) All illustrative information, including all the map and supporting block assignment file and statistics, provided to members of the General Assembly and the public during the legislative debate in July 2011 showed those Census blocks as assigned
                    to a district.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) The map and supporting block assignment file and statistics formed the basis of the General Assembly's understanding of and actual legislative intent for the districts as enacted in Session Law 2011-403.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) The purpose of this act is to cure Session Law 2011-403 and conform the textual explanation of the United States Congressional districting plan to the actual legislative intent as depicted by the map and supporting block assignment file and statistics
                    reviewed by the General Assembly in July 2011.

                <p>

                    On February 5, 2016, a 3-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina held in Harris v McCrory, that the U.S. House district boundaries for the 1st and 12th Congressional Districts were drawn as a result of "racial
                    gerrymandering", and thus that the 2011 Congressional Redistricting Plan violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The General Assembly was given two weeks - until February 19, 2016 - to redraw
                    the boundaries to remedy the constitutional defects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To comply with the court order in Harris v. McCrory, the General Assembly enacted Session Laws 2016-1, Ex. Sess., providing for a new redistricting plan in conformance with the court's mandate.

                    Court for the Middle District of North Carolina holding unconstitutional G.S. 163-201(a) as it existed prior to the enactment of this act (or the decision is otherwise enjoined, made inoperable, or ineffective), and in any such case
                    the prior version of G.S. 163-201(a) is again effective." As of September 30, 2016, this contingency that would make the 2011 Congressional Redistricting Plan operable again has not been met.

                    <p>
                        The Act of the 1967 session of the legislature reapportioning congressional districts met minimum federal constitutional standards. Drum v. Seawell, 271 F. Supp. 193 (M.D.N.C. 1967).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the variance between the enacted legislative plan and a rejected alternative plan was insubstantial and de minimis, and the legislature made a good faith effort to equitably reapportion, this section was constitutional and not in violation of the equal
                        protection clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Drum v. Scott, 337 F. Supp. 588 (M.D.N.C. 1972).

                    <p>
                        Voters who sought injunctive relief against implementation of reapportionment plan had stated a claim under the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, by alleging that the reapportionment plan was so irrational on its face that the plan
                        could be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race, and that the separation lacked sufficient justification. Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 113 S. Ct. 2816, 125 L. Ed. 2d

        §
       </span> 1973c, violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, because race was the legislature's predominant consideration in determining the second majority-black district's shape and placement; and
                        because the plan was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, i.e., avoiding liability for minority vote dilution. Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 116 S. Ct. 1894, 135 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1996).

                        The General Assembly's motivation in drawing the boundaries of a congressional district was a disputed question of fact, and summary judgement in favor of plaintiffs who challenged its motivation as unconstitutional racial gerrymandering was not appropriate,
                        where the congressional districting plan was race-neutral on its face, and the State succeeded in showing that other reasonable inferences could be drawn from the undisputed facts than the plan was based upon racial motivation.

                    Upon receipt of the certifications prepared by the State Board of Elections and delivered in accordance with G.S. 163-182.15, the Secretary of State, under seal of the office, shall notify the Governor of the names of the persons elected to the office
                    of elector for President and Vice-President of the United States as stated in the abstracts of the State Board of Elections. Thereupon, the Governor shall immediately issue a proclamation setting forth the names of the electors and
                    instructing them to be present in the old Hall of the House of Representatives in the State Capitol in the City of Raleigh at noon on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December next after their election, at which time
                    the electors shall meet and vote on behalf of the State for President and Vice-President of the United States. The Governor shall cause this proclamation to be published in the daily newspapers published in the City of Raleigh. Notice
                    may additionally be made on a radio or television station or both, but such notice shall be in addition to the newspaper and other required notice. The Secretary of State is responsible for making the actual arrangements for the meeting,

                    Before the date fixed for the meeting of the electors, the Governor shall send by registered mail to the Archivist of the United States, either three duplicate original certificates, or one original certificate and two authenticated copies of the Certificates
                    of Ascertainment, under the great seal of the State setting forth the names of the persons chosen as presidential electors for this State and the number of votes cast for each. These Certificates of Ascertainment should be sent as
                    soon as possible after the election, but must be received before the Electoral College meeting. At the same time the Governor shall deliver to the electors six duplicate originals of the same certificate, each bearing the great seal
                    of the State. At any time prior to receipt of the certificate of the Governor or within 48 hours thereafter, any person elected to the office of elector may resign by submitting his resignation, written and duly verified, to the Governor.
                    Failure to so resign shall signify consent to serve and to cast his vote for the candidate of the political party which nominated such elector.

                    In case of the absence, ineligibility or resignation of any elector chosen, or if the proper number of electors shall for any cause be deficient, the first and second alternates, respectively, who were nominated under G.S. 163-1(c), shall fill the first
                    two vacancies. If the alternates are absent, ineligible, resign, or were not chosen, or if there are more than two vacancies, then the electors present at the required meeting shall forthwith elect from the citizens of the State a
                    sufficient number of persons to fill the deficiency, and the persons chosen shall be deemed qualified electors to vote for President and Vice-President of the United States.

        Discrimination Against Independent Candidates Unconstitutional.

                        a new party to submit petitions signed by only 10,000 voters, less than one-sixteenth the number required of an independent candidate, and furthermore, in requiring a candidate desiring to run in the North Carolina presidential
                        preference primary to submit only 10,000 signatures; since the State asserted no compelling interest for such disparate treatment, that portion of G.S. 163-122 which required an independent candidate for president to file written
                        petitions signed by qualified voters equal in number to 10 percent of those who voted for Governor in the last gubernatorial election was an unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of such candidate and his supporters to

                    to vote, except that an unaffiliated voter may vote in a party primary if permitted under G.S. 163-119. The official registration records of the county in which the voter is registered shall be proof of whether the qualified voter
                    is affiliated with a political party and of the party, if any, with which the qualified voter is affiliated.

                    request for absentee ballots for a second primary not earlier than the day a second primary is called and not later than the date and time provided by G.S. 163-230.1.

                    Session Laws 2005-256, s. 1, as amended by Session Laws 2005-305, s. 4.1, provides: "With the approval of the State Board of Elections, the Orange County Board of Elections may conduct a pilot program in Chapel Hill Township for any or all primaries or
                    elections occurring prior to January 1, 2007, where the requirements of this section prevail over any other requirement concerning voting at one-stop sites or on election day. The pilot program shall consist of continuing one-stop
                    voting as provided in G.S. 163-227.2 on election day as the method of voting. Voting places, whether during the one-stop period or on election day, shall be known as voting centers. The pilot program consists of the following elements:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Any voter properly registered in Chapel Hill Township may vote at any voting center during the one-stop period established in G.S. 163-227.2 or on election day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) On election day, the only places open to vote in Chapel Hill Township are those designated as voting centers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) All voting centers shall have a Web-based or online connection to the voter registration system so that voter registration information and voting history can be checked in a timely manner to ensure against any voter voting more than once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(e1), the State Board of Elections shall determine which ballots must be made retrievable and identifiable to the county board of elections in order to ensure that the vote count by eligible voters is accurate. If any
                    vote need not be identifiable, it shall not be made so, notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(e1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) The Plan of Implementation may provide a different system for voter sign-in than the regular one-stop process which requires completion of an absentee ballot application, but the process must be auditable. As required by G.S. 163-166.7, the voter,
                    before voting, shall sign that voter's name on the pollbook, other voting record, or voter authorization document. As provided by G.S. 163-166.7, if the voter is unable to sign, a voting center official shall enter the person's name
                    on the same document before the voter votes. A voter at a voting center shall be entitled to the same assistance as a voter at a voting place on election day under G.S. 163-166.8.

                <p>

                    "(3) Each experimental voting system shall include an additional means for the voter to verify the choices that the voter makes in the electronically cast ballot, which means shall also provide for an additional count. That additional means may utilize
                    audio technology, digital scanners, or some other material or technology that shall record the voters' choices but shall not record any image of any part of the voter.
                </p>
                <p>

                    of each individual vote cast electronically and the requirement in G.S. 163-165.7(a)(5) that the paper record generated by the DRE system must be viewable by the voter before the vote is cast electronically and that the system allow
                    the voter to correct any discrepancy between the electronic vote and the paper record before the vote is cast. On every machine or unit, the experimental means to fulfill those functions shall be used in addition to, rather than instead
                    of, the required paper means.

        Reduction of Early Voting Days Not Enjoined.
       </b> - Although minority voters might prevail on the merits, denial of a preliminary injunction was proper with respect to newly enacted voting law provisions, including reducing early-voting days, enjoining which would
                        present an undue hardship to the State and county election boards, and eliminating pre-registration of 16- and 17-year-olds who would not be 18 by the next general election, due to lack of irreparable harm. League of Women Voters

                        of unreported move shall be allowed to vote the same kind of absentee ballot as other one-stop voters. (f) Notwithstanding the exception specified in G.S. 163-36, counties which operate a modified full-time office shall remain
                        open five days each week during regular business hours consistent with daily hours presently observed by the county board of elections, commencing with the date prescribed in G.S. 163-227.2(b) and continuing until 5:00 P.M. on
                        the Friday prior to that election and shall also be open on the last Saturday before the election. A county board may conduct one-stop absentee voting during evenings or on weekends, as long as the hours are part of a plan submitted
                        and approved according to subsection (g) of this section. The boards of county commissioners shall provide necessary funds for the additional operation of the office during that time.

                    Subsections (g) and (h) were designated as such at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes, the designations in Session Laws 1999-455, s. 6 having been (f1) and (f2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2005-256, s. 1, as amended by Session Laws 2005-305, s. 4.1, provides: "With the approval of the State Board of Elections, the Orange County Board of Elections may conduct a pilot program in Chapel Hill Township for any or all primaries or
                    elections occurring prior to January 1, 2007, where the requirements of this section prevail over any other requirement concerning voting at one-stop sites or on election day. The pilot program shall consist of continuing one-stop
                    voting as provided in G.S. 163-227.2 on election day as the method of voting. Voting places, whether during the one-stop period or on election day, shall be known as voting centers. The pilot program consists of the following elements:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Any voter properly registered in Chapel Hill Township may vote at any voting center during the one-stop period established in G.S. 163-227.2 or on election day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) On election day, the only places open to vote in Chapel Hill Township are those designated as voting centers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) All voting centers shall have a Web-based or online connection to the voter registration system so that voter registration information and voting history can be checked in a timely manner to ensure against any voter voting more than once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(e1), the State Board of Elections shall determine which ballots must be made retrievable and identifiable to the county board of elections in order to ensure that the vote count by eligible voters is accurate. If any
                    vote need not be identifiable, it shall not be made so, notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(e1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) The Plan of Implementation may provide a different system for voter sign-in than the regular one-stop process which requires completion of an absentee ballot application, but the process must be auditable. As required by G.S. 163-166.7, the voter,
                    before voting, shall sign that voter's name on the pollbook, other voting record, or voter authorization document. As provided by G.S. 163-166.7, if the voter is unable to sign, a voting center official shall enter the person's name
                    on the same document before the voter votes. A voter at a voting center shall be entitled to the same assistance as a voter at a voting place on election day under G.S. 163-166.8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) A larger number of voting centers may be open on election day than during the earlier part of the one-stop period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) Election returns shall be reported by regular precinct as well as by voting center. Notwithstanding G.S. 163-132.5G, for primary elections in 2006, those returns by regular precinct shall be reported by May 1, 2007, and for the 2006 general election
                    those returns by regular precinct shall be reported by March 1, 2007. G.S. 163-132.5G shall not apply to elections held in 2005 under this act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(8) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(g), the State Board of Elections may allow the county board of elections during the regular one-stop voting period to designate voting centers in commercial buildings that are not public buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(9) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(g), on election day any building may be designated as a voting center, but the office of the county board of elections does not have to be designated as a voting center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(10) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(g), officials appointed pursuant to G.S. 163-41, 163-42, and 163-42.1 may be assigned to staff the voting centers. The Plan of Implementation shall provide for appointment of election officials at voting centers so
                    that political parties have a similar opportunity to recommend officials as if there were precinct polling places.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(11) The Plan of Implementation may for administrative purposes treat the entire township as one precinct with multiple voting places on election day, but a voter must, when appearing to vote, report any change of address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(12) Before voting centers may be used under this section, a Plan of Implementation must be approved unanimously by the county board of elections and then approved by the Executive Director of the State Board of Elections. Prior to adoption, the county
                    board of elections shall conduct a public hearing and notify the county chair of each political party under Article 9 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes. The county board of elections shall develop an outreach and education campaign to inform voters about the changes in voting locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(13) If any polling place that had been a satellite voting place in 2004 under G.S. 163-130 is designated as a voting center, the county board of elections may provide in its Plan of Implementation that only voters assigned to the satellite voting place
                    may vote at the voting center there, and that such voters may not vote at any other voting center on election day."

                    of G.S. 163-165.7(a)(4) and G.S. 163-165.7(a)(5), as enacted by this act. The pilot program may be conducted in no more than nine counties. The county boards of elections shall cooperate in conducting the pilot program. The pilot program
                    shall be conducted according to the following requirements:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) The experiment may be conducted in no more than two voting sites per county. The voting sites may include election-day voting places or one-stop sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) At each voting site in which the experiment is conducted, voters must have a choice of voting on the experimental voting system or on a voting system that is not part of the experiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) Each experimental voting system shall include an additional means for the voter to verify the choices that the voter makes in the electronically cast ballot, which means shall also provide for an additional count. That additional means may utilize
                    audio technology, digital scanners, or some other material or technology that shall record the voters' choices but shall not record any image of any part of the voter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) On each voting machine or unit used in the experiment, the voting system shall comply with all the applicable requirements of G.S. 163-165.7, including the requirement in G.S. 163-165.7(a)(4) that a DRE system must generate a paper backup record
                    of each individual vote cast electronically and the requirement in G.S. 163-165.7(a)(5) that the paper record generated by the DRE system must be viewable by the voter before the vote is cast electronically and that the system allow
                    the voter to correct any discrepancy between the electronic vote and the paper record before the vote is cast. On every machine or unit, the experimental means to fulfill those functions shall be used in addition to, rather than instead
                    of, the required paper means.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) For all votes cast on an experimental voting system under the pilot, there shall be, in addition to an electronic count, a full hand-to-eye paper count and a full comparison count of the experimental verification technology.

                <p>
                    If a county uses a voting system with retrievable ballots, that county's board of elections may by resolution elect to conduct one-stop absentee voting according to the provisions of this section. In a county in which the board has opted to do so, a one-stop
                    voter shall cast the ballot and then shall deposit the ballot in the ballot box or voting system in the same manner as if such box or system was in use in a precinct on election day. At the end of each business day, or at any time
                    when there will be no employee or officer of the board of elections on the premises, the ballot box or system shall be secured in accordance with a plan approved by the State Board of Elections, which shall include that no additional
                    ballots have been placed in the box or system. Any county board desiring to conduct one-stop voting according to this section shall submit a plan for doing so to the State Board of Elections. The State Board shall adopt standards for
                    conducting one-stop voting under this section and shall approve any county plan that adheres to its standards. The county board shall adhere to its State Board-approved plan. The plan shall provide that each one-stop ballot shall have
                    a ballot number on it in accordance with G.S. 163-230.1(c), or shall have an equivalent identifier to allow for retrievability.

                    Session Laws 2005-256, s. 1, as amended by Session Laws 2005-305, s. 4.1, provides: "With the approval of the State Board of Elections, the Orange County Board of Elections may conduct a pilot program in Chapel Hill Township for any or all primaries or
                    elections occurring prior to January 1, 2007, where the requirements of this section prevail over any other requirement concerning voting at one-stop sites or on election day. The pilot program shall consist of continuing one-stop
                    voting as provided in G.S. 163-227.2 on election day as the method of voting. Voting places, whether during the one-stop period or on election day, shall be known as voting centers. The pilot program consists of the following elements:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Any voter properly registered in Chapel Hill Township may vote at any voting center during the one-stop period established in G.S. 163-227.2 or on election day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) On election day, the only places open to vote in Chapel Hill Township are those designated as voting centers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) All voting centers shall have a Web-based or online connection to the voter registration system so that voter registration information and voting history can be checked in a timely manner to ensure against any voter voting more than once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(e1), the State Board of Elections shall determine which ballots must be made retrievable and identifiable to the county board of elections in order to ensure that the vote count by eligible voters is accurate. If any
                    vote need not be identifiable, it shall not be made so, notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(e1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) The Plan of Implementation may provide a different system for voter sign-in than the regular one-stop process which requires completion of an absentee ballot application, but the process must be auditable. As required by G.S. 163-166.7, the voter,
                    before voting, shall sign that voter's name on the pollbook, other voting record, or voter authorization document. As provided by G.S. 163-166.7, if the voter is unable to sign, a voting center official shall enter the person's name
                    on the same document before the voter votes. A voter at a voting center shall be entitled to the same assistance as a voter at a voting place on election day under G.S. 163-166.8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) A larger number of voting centers may be open on election day than during the earlier part of the one-stop period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) Election returns shall be reported by regular precinct as well as by voting center. Notwithstanding G.S. 163-132.5G, for primary elections in 2006, those returns by regular precinct shall be reported by May 1, 2007, and for the 2006 general election
                    those returns by regular precinct shall be reported by March 1, 2007. G.S. 163-132.5G shall not apply to elections held in 2005 under this act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(8) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(g), the State Board of Elections may allow the county board of elections during the regular one-stop voting period to designate voting centers in commercial buildings that are not public buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(9) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(g), on election day any building may be designated as a voting center, but the office of the county board of elections does not have to be designated as a voting center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(10) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(g), officials appointed pursuant to G.S. 163-41, 163-42, and 163-42.1 may be assigned to staff the voting centers. The Plan of Implementation shall provide for appointment of election officials at voting centers so
                    that political parties have a similar opportunity to recommend officials as if there were precinct polling places.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(11) The Plan of Implementation may for administrative purposes treat the entire township as one precinct with multiple voting places on election day, but a voter must, when appearing to vote, report any change of address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(12) Before voting centers may be used under this section, a Plan of Implementation must be approved unanimously by the county board of elections and then approved by the Executive Director of the State Board of Elections. Prior to adoption, the county
                    board of elections shall conduct a public hearing and notify the county chair of each political party under Article 9 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes.

                        Notwithstanding any other provision of G.S. 163-227.2, 163-227.5, and this section, a county board of elections by unanimous vote of all its members may provide for one or more sites in that county for absentee ballots to be applied for and cast under
                        these sections. Every individual staffing any of those sites shall be a member or full-time employee of the county board of elections or an employee of the county board of elections whom the board has given training equivalent
                        to that given a full-time employee. Those sites must be approved by the State Board as part of a Plan for Implementation approved by both the county board of elections and by the State Board which shall also provide adequate security
                        of the ballots and provisions to avoid allowing persons to vote who have already voted. The Plan for Implementation shall include a provision for the presence of political party observers at each one-stop site equivalent to the
                        provisions in G.S. 163-45 for party observers at voting places on election day. A county board of elections may propose in its Plan not to offer one-stop voting at the county board of elections office; the State Board may approve
                        that proposal in a Plan only if the Plan includes at least one site reasonably proximate to the county board of elections office and the State Board finds that the sites in the Plan as a whole provide adequate coverage of the county's
                        electorate. If a county board of elections has considered a proposed Plan or Plans for Implementation and has been unable to reach unanimity in favor of a Plan, a member or members of that county board of elections may petition
                        the State Board to adopt a plan for it. If petitioned, the State Board may also receive and consider alternative petitions from another member or members of that county board. The State Board may adopt a Plan for that county. The
                        State Board, in that plan, shall take into consideration whether the Plan disproportionately favors any party, racial or ethnic group, or candidate.

                        under G.S. 163-129 to demand and use as an election-day voting place, unless the State Board finds that other equally suitable sites were not available and that the use of the sites chosen will not disproportionately favor any
                        party, racial or ethnic group, or candidate. In providing the site or sites for one-stop absentee voting under G.S. 163-227.2, 163-227.5, and this section, the county board of elections shall make a request to the State, county,
                        city, local school board, or other entity in control of the building that is supported or maintained, in whole or in part, by or through tax revenues at least 90 days prior to the start of one-stop absentee voting under these sections.
                        The request shall clearly identify the building, or any specific portion thereof, requested the dates and times for which that building or specific portion thereof is requested and the requirement of an area for election related
                        activity. If the State, local governing board, or other entity in control of the building does not respond to the request within 20 days, the building or specific portion thereof may be used for one-stop absentee voting as stated
                        in the request. If the State, local governing board, or other entity in control of the building or specific portion thereof responds negatively to the request within 20 days, that entity and the county board of elections shall,
                        in good faith, work to identify a building or specific portion thereof in which to conduct one-stop absentee voting under 163-227.2, 163-227.5, and this section. If no building or specific portion thereof has been agreed upon within
                        45 days from the date the county board of elections received a response to the request, the matter shall be resolved by the State Board.

                    Session Laws 2005-256, s. 1, as amended by Session Laws 2005-305, s. 4.1, provides: "With the approval of the State Board of Elections, the Orange County Board of Elections may conduct a pilot program in Chapel Hill Township for any or all primaries or
                    elections occurring prior to January 1, 2007, where the requirements of this section prevail over any other requirement concerning voting at one-stop sites or on election day. The pilot program shall consist of continuing one-stop
                    voting as provided in G.S. 163-227.2 on election day as the method of voting. Voting places, whether during the one-stop period or on election day, shall be known as voting centers. The pilot program consists of the following elements:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Any voter properly registered in Chapel Hill Township may vote at any voting center during the one-stop period established in G.S. 163-227.2 or on election day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) On election day, the only places open to vote in Chapel Hill Township are those designated as voting centers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) All voting centers shall have a Web-based or online connection to the voter registration system so that voter registration information and voting history can be checked in a timely manner to ensure against any voter voting more than once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(e1), the State Board of Elections shall determine which ballots must be made retrievable and identifiable to the county board of elections in order to ensure that the vote count by eligible voters is accurate. If any
                    vote need not be identifiable, it shall not be made so, notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(e1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) The Plan of Implementation may provide a different system for voter sign-in than the regular one-stop process which requires completion of an absentee ballot application, but the process must be auditable. As required by G.S. 163-166.7, the voter,
                    before voting, shall sign that voter's name on the pollbook, other voting record, or voter authorization document. As provided by G.S. 163-166.7, if the voter is unable to sign, a voting center official shall enter the person's name
                    on the same document before the voter votes. A voter at a voting center shall be entitled to the same assistance as a voter at a voting place on election day under G.S. 163-166.8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) A larger number of voting centers may be open on election day than during the earlier part of the one-stop period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) Election returns shall be reported by regular precinct as well as by voting center. Notwithstanding G.S. 163-132.5G, for primary elections in 2006, those returns by regular precinct shall be reported by May 1, 2007, and for the 2006 general election
                    those returns by regular precinct shall be reported by March 1, 2007. G.S. 163-132.5G shall not apply to elections held in 2005 under this act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(8) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(g), the State Board of Elections may allow the county board of elections during the regular one-stop voting period to designate voting centers in commercial buildings that are not public buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(9) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(g), on election day any building may be designated as a voting center, but the office of the county board of elections does not have to be designated as a voting center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(10) Notwithstanding G.S. 163-227.2(g), officials appointed pursuant to G.S. 163-41, 163-42, and 163-42.1 may be assigned to staff the voting centers. The Plan of Implementation shall provide for appointment of election officials at voting centers so
                    that political parties have a similar opportunity to recommend officials as if there were precinct polling places.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(11) The Plan of Implementation may for administrative purposes treat the entire township as one precinct with multiple voting places on election day, but a voter must, when appearing to vote, report any change of address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(12) Before voting centers may be used under this section, a Plan of Implementation must be approved unanimously by the county board of elections and then approved by the Executive Director of the State Board of Elections. Prior to adoption, the county
                    board of elections shall conduct a public hearing and notify the county chair of each political party under Article 9 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes. The county board of elections shall develop an outreach and education campaign to inform voters about the changes in voting locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(13) If any polling place that had been a satellite voting place in 2004 under G.S. 163-130 is designated as a voting center, the county board of elections may provide in its Plan of Implementation that only voters assigned to the satellite voting place
                    may vote at the voting center there, and that such voters may not vote at any other voting center on election day."

                    shall be conducted according to the following requirements:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) The experiment may be conducted in no more than two voting sites per county. The voting sites may include election-day voting places or one-stop sites.

                <p>

                <p>
                    "(3) Each experimental voting system shall include an additional means for the voter to verify the choices that the voter makes in the electronically cast ballot, which means shall also provide for an additional count. That additional means may utilize
                    audio technology, digital scanners, or some other material or technology that shall record the voters' choices but shall not record any image of any part of the voter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) On each voting machine or unit used in the experiment, the voting system shall comply with all the applicable requirements of G.S. 163-165.7, including the requirement in G.S. 163-165.7(a)(4) that a DRE system must generate a paper backup record
                    of each individual vote cast electronically and the requirement in G.S. 163-165.7(a)(5) that the paper record generated by the DRE system must be viewable by the voter before the vote is cast electronically and that the system allow
                    the voter to correct any discrepancy between the electronic vote and the paper record before the vote is cast. On every machine or unit, the experimental means to fulfill those functions shall be used in addition to, rather than instead
                    of, the required paper means.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) For all votes cast on an experimental voting system under the pilot, there shall be, in addition to an electronic count, a full hand-to-eye paper count and a full comparison count of the experimental verification technology.

        Reduction of Early Voting Days Not Enjoined.
       </b> - Although minority voters might prevail on the merits, denial of a preliminary injunction was proper with respect to newly enacted voting law provisions, including reducing early-voting days, enjoining which would
                        present an undue hardship to the State and county election boards, and eliminating pre-registration of 16- and 17-year-olds who would not be 18 by the next general election, due to lack of irreparable harm. League of Women Voters

        Constitutionality of State Elections Board Memorandum.
       </b> Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the State Board of Elections memorandum extending the deadline for receiving ballots was likely to violate equal protection where the change contravened the express
                        deadline established by the General Assembly, by extending the deadline from three days after Election Day, to nine days after Election Day. Moreover, it resulted in disparate treatment, as voters like the individual plaintiffs
                        returned their ballots within the time-frame permitted under state law, but other voters whose ballots would otherwise not be counted if received three days after Election Day, would have an additional six days to return their
                        ballot. Moore v. Circosta, - F. Supp. 2d - (M.D.N.C. Oct. 14, 2020), appeal dismissed, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 715 (4th Cir. 2021).

                        Plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their equal protection challenge to a State Board of Elections' memorandum clarifying that a ballot would be considered postmarked by Election Day if it had a USPS postmark, and there was information in BallotTrax,
                        or another tracking service offered by the USPS or a commercial carrier, indicating that the ballot was in the custody of USPS or the commercial carrier on or before Election Day. Moore v. Circosta, - F. Supp. 2d - (M.D.N.C. Oct.

                        Voters Must Be Sworn. - Where the evidence supports the findings that certain absentee voters were not sworn, the rejection of their ballots is proper. State ex rel. Owens v. Chaplin, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 705</cite>,

                        Oaths Need Not Be Taken upon the Bible. - The fact that the oaths of absentee voters were not taken by them upon the Bible, but were taken with uplifted hands, does not invalidate their votes. State ex rel. Owens v. Chaplin,

                    entry of tally cards from direct record electronic voting units into a computer for processing. The board shall not announce the result of the count before 7:30 p.m.

                    other absentee ballots are counted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a challenge transmitted to the board on canvass day by a chief judge is sustained, the ballots challenged and sustained shall be withdrawn from the appropriate boxes, as provided in G.S. 163-89(e).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As soon as the absentee ballots have been counted and the names of the absentee voters entered in the pollbook as required in this subdivision, the board members and assistants employed to count the absentee ballots shall each sign the pollbook immediately
                    beneath the last absentee voter's name entered in the pollbook. The county board of elections is responsible for the safekeeping of the pollbook of absentee voters.

        Constitutionality.
       </b> - Because the monetary trigger contained in G.S. 163-278.6(14) fails to account for the overall activities of an entity and may be used as evidence of an entity's major purpose, it is unconstitutionally overbroad, however,
                        any presumption in this context is not per se unconstitutional as this holding is limited to the major purpose presumption based entirely on a monetary standard completely untethered from the other factors identified by the United
                        States Supreme Court in determining major purposes. The portion of G.S. 163-278.6(14) relating to the major purpose presumption is therefore substantially overbroad and invalid; however, the remaining portions of G.S. 163-278.6(14)
                        can be severed and given effect without the invalid portion. G.S. 163-278.5. N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 344 F.3d 418 (4th Cir. 2003).

        Constitutionality.
       </b> - Because subdivision (14) imposes spending restrictions and reporting requirements on groups engaging only in issue advocacy and does not limit its coverage to entities engaging in express advocacy, it violates the
                        First Amendment and is facially unconstitutional. North Carolina Right to Life v. Bartlett, 3 F. Supp. 2d 675 (E.D.N.C. 1998), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 168 F.3d 705 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S.

                    <p>
                        Subdivision (14) is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in that its definition of political committee encompasses both express and issue advocacy and thus subjects groups engaged only in issue advocacy to an intrusive set of reporting requirements,
                        placing an unacceptable burden on speech. Reyes v. Chex Sys., Inc., 168 F.3d 705 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Because the monetary trigger contained in G.S. 163-278.6(14) fails to account for the overall activities of an entity and may be used as evidence of an entity's major purpose, it is unconstitutionally overbroad, however, any presumption in this context
                        is not per se unconstitutional as this holding is limited to the major purpose presumption based entirely on a monetary standard completely untethered from the other factors identified by the United States Supreme Court in determining
                        major purposes. The portion of G.S. 163-278.6(14) relating to the major purpose presumption is therefore substantially overbroad and invalid; however, the remaining portions of G.S. 163-278.6(14) can be severed and given effect
                        without the invalid portion. G.S. 163-278.5. N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 344 F.3d 418 (4th Cir. 2003).

                        G.S. 163-278.6(14) expands the definition of political committee beyond the constitutional limits of the First Amendment by imposing a political committee designation and its associated burdens on entities when influencing elections is only a major purpose,
                        instead of the major purpose, of an organization. G.S. 163-278.6(14) magnifies its overbreadth by providing insufficient direction to speakers and leaving regulators free to operate without even the guidance of discernible, neutral
                        criteria; furthermore, narrower means exist for North Carolina to achieve its regulatory goals. N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 525 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2008).

                    <p>
                        Because the Campaign Contributions Prohibition in G.S. 163-278.13C(a) was limited to lobbyists, a small class of people who might also be volunteers, and it allowed volunteering, as it only prohibited volunteer expenses made in coordination with the candidate
                        or the campaign as set forth in G.S. 163-278.6(6), (6h), and because G.S. 163-278.23 allowed for seeking advisory opinions as marginal activity by lobbyists, it survived a First Amendment free speech and freedom of association
                        overbreadth challenge filed by plaintiff lobbyist against defendant state board of elections. Preston v. Leake, 660 F.3d 726 (4th Cir. 2011).

       </b> - A case or controversy existed with respect to challenges by an issue advocacy nonprofit corporation, despite the State's claim that irrespective of the statute's plain language, it would allow plaintiff to engage
                        in forms of issue advocacy without penalty; however, without a change in the statute, the plaintiff's speech remained chilled by the threat of future prosecution. Reyes v. Chex Sys., Inc., 168 F.3d 705 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied,

        Standing and Ripeness.
       </b> - Plaintiff, a tax-exempt nonprofit membership corporation, had standing to challenge this section's definition of "political committee" although the statute had never been applied to it, where it was entitled to preenforcement
                        review in light of the fact that denial of review would impose upon it the choice of either refraining from activity it believed to be constitutionally protected or engaging in such activity and facing possible prosecution; the
                        challenge was ripe for ruling because the plaintiff's stated desire to engage in express advocacy and to spend over $3,000 this election cycle was credible, not merely hypothetical. North Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake,
                        108 F. Supp. 2d 498 (E.D.N.C. 2000).

        Political Committee Registration Requirements Upheld.
       </b> - Plaintiff, a tax-exempt nonprofit membership corporation, was denied a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of North Carolina's political committee registration requirements, as provided in this section, G.S.
                        163-278.7 through 163-278.11 and G.S. 163-278.13, because the court found that the "major purpose" test was neither vague nor overbroad; that North Carolina's higher threshold, $3,000 per two-year election cycle raising a rebuttable
                        presumption that the group's major purpose is electioneering, ensured that only groups engaging in significant electioneering were presumed to be political committees; that North Carolina's express advocacy test narrowed the communications
                        that qualify as expenditures; and that the law provided sufficient notice to and safeguards for issue advocacy groups. North Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 108 F. Supp. 2d 498 (E.D.N.C. 2000).

        Independent Expenditures.
       </b> - Because the application of a $4,000 contribution limit to political committees that make independent expenditures, as defined in G.S. 163-278.6(9a), does not further the state's interest in preventing corruption,
                        G.S. 163-278.13 violates the First Amendment insofar as G.S. 163-278.13 is applied to independent expenditure political committees. N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 525 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2008).

        Constitutionality.
       </b> - Four thousand dollar limitation on contributions to "independent expenditure political action committees" under G.S. 163-278.13, is substantially overbroad and unconstitutional. N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake,
                        344 F.3d 418 (4th Cir. 2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        G.S. 163-278.13's limit on contributions was unconstitutional as applied to an independent expenditure political committee (IEPC) established by a nonprofit corporation because the contribution limits were not closely drawn to protect issue advocacy protected
                        by the First Amendment; the State failed to show that independent expenditures made by IEPCs had a tendency to corrupt or create an appearance of corruption, and the State did not identify any legal authority that considered a
                        political action committee and its sponsoring corporation, which was prohibited under 2 U.S.C.
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 441b from making contributions and independent expenditures, as identical entities. N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 482 F. Supp. 2d 686 (E.D.N.C. 2007), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 525 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. N.C.

                    <p>
                        Because the application of a $4,000 contribution limit to political committees that make independent expenditures, as defined in G.S. 163-278.6(9a), does not further the state's interest in preventing corruption, G.S. 163-278.13 violates the First Amendment
                        insofar as G.S. 163-278.13 is applied to independent expenditure political committees. N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 525 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2008).

                        Ban on contributions during the twenty-one days prior to an election under the Judicial Campaign Reform Act, G.S. 163-278.13(e2)(3), did not violate the First Amendment because the ban was a closely drawn means of advancing the state's interest in operating
                        a public funding system to minimize the danger of corruption, or the appearance thereof, in judicial elections. N.C. Right to Life Comm. Fund v. Leake, 524 F.3d 427 (4th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 994, 129 S. Ct. 490, 2008

        Political Committee Registration Requirements Upheld.
       </b> - Plaintiff, a tax-exempt nonprofit membership corporation, was denied a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of North Carolina's political committee registration requirements, as provided in G.S. 163-278.6(14),
                        G.S. 163-278.7 through 163-278.11 and this section, because the court found that the "major purpose" test was neither vague nor overbroad; that North Carolina's higher threshold, $3,000 per two-year election cycle raising a rebuttable
                        presumption that the group's major purpose is electioneering, ensured that only groups engaging in significant electioneering were presumed to be political committees; that North Carolina's express advocacy test narrowed the communications
                        that qualify as expenditures; and that the law provided sufficient notice to and safeguards for issue advocacy groups. North Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 108 F. Supp. 2d 498 (E.D.N.C. 2000).

        Plaintiff, a tax-exempt nonprofit membership corporation, had standing to challenge this section
       </b> and assert the rights of its contributors because it was a "single-issue" organization, its contributors were closely-identified with each other by the desire to elect pro-life candidates, the provision was shown to
                        cause injury to the organization, and a significant obstacle to members' challenge of the provision existed where the organization could not easily discover contributors wishing to donate more than $4,000 without itself transgressing
                        the law; however, since the plaintiff was unlikely to prevail on the merits, a preliminary injunction was found inappropriate. North Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 108 F. Supp. 2d 498 (E.D.N.C. 2000).

                        mailing this solicitation, and where the State provided insufficient evidence to suggest that the threat of prosecution was merely speculative. North Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 108 F. Supp. 2d 498 (E.D.N.C. 2000).

                    <p>
                        This section is unconstitutional as applied to independent political committees accepting contributions on behalf of candidates; while this section was enacted for a compelling governmental interest, i.e., the prevention of corruption or the appearance
                        of corruption among both incumbents and challengers while the General Assembly is in session, the remedy set forth was not narrowly tailored and the court, therefore, properly severed "political committee" from the definition of
                        "limited contributee." Winborne v. Easley, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 191, 523 S.E.2d 149 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Constitutionality as to Individual Challenger. - Because a compelling government interest was addressed in amending this section to include challengers, the section is narrowly tailored in its application to challengers, as well as incumbents; plaintiff
                        who made no showing that the section invidiously discriminates against him as a challenger unsuccessfully challenged its constitutionality as applied to him. Winborne v. Easley, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite>                        191, 523 S.E.2d 149 (1999).

                        Furthermore, the restrictions advance a compelling state interest by preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption. Reyes v. Chex Sys., Inc., 168 F.3d 705 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156,

                        The constitutionality of this section was properly before the court, although not directly raised, where plaintiff sought a means to obtain contributions from lobbyists and their political committees during the legislative session. Winborne v. Easley,
                        <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 191, 523 S.E.2d 149 (1999).

                        Lobbyist was not entitled to judgment on the pleadings on her action alleging that G.S. 163-278.13C(a) (the campaign contribution prohibition) violated rights of free speech and association as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments because the
                        court could not find on the pleadings that the campaign contribution prohibition so significantly impeded lobbyists' First Amendment rights as to be unconstitutional, as there were numerous ways lobbyists were still allowed to
                        directly exercise their rights of free expression and association under the campaign contribution prohibition (including expressing support for or opposition to a candidate, volunteering for a candidate, making contributions to
                        their employer's political committees and then making recommendations as to who the committee should support, and soliciting others to make contributions to a candidate). Preston v. Leake, 629 F. Supp. 2d 517 (E.D.N.C. 2009).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ban on a lobbyist's direct contributions to a candidate's campaign was closely drawn to the sufficiently important governmental interest of combating corruption and the appearance of combating corruption in campaigns for legislative office; statute was
                        not void for vagueness because, inter alia, "in-kind" contribution had common usage and the statute appeared to give sufficient guidance to the North Carolina State Board of Elections to craft advisory opinions concerning the statute's
                        prohibitions. Preston v. Leake, 743 F. Supp. 2d 501 (E.D.N.C. Oct. 19, 2010), aff'd, 660 F.3d 726, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 22520 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Because the Campaign Contributions Prohibition in G.S. 163-278.13C(a) was in response to recent corruptions, banning lobbyists' contributions was a rational judgment made to prevent actual corruption and the appearance of corruption; it survived a First
                        Amendment free speech and freedom of association challenge filed by plaintiff lobbyist against defendant state board of elections. Preston v. Leake, 660 F.3d 726 (4th Cir. 2011).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the Campaign Contributions Prohibition in G.S. 163-278.13C(a) was limited to lobbyists, a small class of people who might also be volunteers, and it allowed volunteering, as it only prohibited volunteer expenses made in coordination with the candidate
                        or the campaign as set forth in G.S. 163-278.6(6), (6h), and because G.S. 163-278.23 allowed for seeking advisory opinions as marginal activity by lobbyists, it survived a First Amendment free speech and freedom of association
                        overbreadth challenge filed by plaintiff lobbyist against defendant state board of elections. Preston v. Leake, 660 F.3d 726 (4th Cir. 2011).

        Standing to Challenge Statute.
       </b> - As G.S. 163-278.13C(a) facially restricted the expressive activity of a class to which the lobbyist belonged, and violators of the campaign contribution prohibition were subject to prosecution, all the requisite elements
                        to establish a "credible threat of prosecution" were present, and as the campaign contribution prohibition tended to chill the exercise of First Amendment rights, the lobbyist had established standing to challenge the campaign
                        contribution prohibition. Preston v. Leake, 629 F. Supp. 2d 517 (E.D.N.C. 2009).

                        unconstitutional; however, G.S. 163-278.14A(a)(2) is severable, and after such severance, the remainder of G.S. 163-278.14A is valid and enforceable, as is G.S. 163-278.6(14). N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 482 F. Supp. 2d

        Standing to Raise Constitutional Challenge to Campaign Finance Laws.
       </b> - Nonprofit corporation and affiliated political committees had standing to assert pre-enforcement challenges to campaign finance laws because the nonprofit corporation and political committees were chilled from engaging
                        in potentially protected First Amendment political expression given that G.S. 163-278.27 subjected the nonprofit corporation and the political committees to the threat of prosecution for intentionally violating the challenged campaign

                        As G.S. 163-278.13C(a) facially restricted the expressive activity of a class to which the lobbyist belonged, and violators of the campaign contribution prohibition were subject to prosecution, all the requisite elements to establish a "credible threat
                        of prosecution" were present, and as the campaign contribution prohibition tended to chill the exercise of First Amendment rights, the lobbyist had established standing to challenge the campaign contribution prohibition. Preston

                    If the form is filed by mail, no civil late penalty shall be assessed for any day after the date of postmark. No civil late penalty shall be assessed for any day when the Board office at which the report is due is closed. The State Board shall immediately
                    notify, or cause to be notified, late filers, from which reports are apparently due, by mail, of the penalties under this section. The State Board of Elections may waive a late penalty if it determines there is good cause for the waiver.

                    If the Board determines by clear and convincing evidence that the late filing constitutes a willful attempt to conceal contributions or expenditures, the Board may assess a civil penalty in an amount to be determined by that Board, plus the costs of investigation,
                    assessment, and collection. The civil penalty shall not exceed three times the amount of the contributions and expenditures willfully attempted to be concealed.

                        "Sponsors." - Payment of production costs for the "message" constitutes part of the sponsorship of an "advertisement" under G.S. 163-278.39A(b) [now repealed]; thus, for the "sponsors" to be properly identified, all of the purchasers of both parts of

                        [now repealed], plaintiff could not recover damages under G.S. 163-278.39A(f) [now repealed] even if defendant political committees also violated the disclosure requirements. Friends of Joe Sam Queen v. Hise,

                        complied with the requirements of the statute and clearly fell under the class of persons on whom the statute conferred a cause of action; the candidate against whom the ad was run assigned his interest in the case to his committee.

        "For-or-Against Requirement" Possibly Unconstitutional.
       </b> - The plaintiff, a tax-exempt nonprofit membership corporation which claimed that requiring any advertisement to state whether the sponsor was for or against the candidate constituted coerced speech, was entitled to
                        injunctive relief; this section's "for-or-against requirement" compelling political speech that an advertisement sponsor might otherwise wish to avoid placed a content-based restraint on core political speech while adding little
                        to the public's knowledge, where the "sponsors" already had to identify themselves, and the requirement's nexus with the State's informational interest was so weak that it was unlikely to withstand exacting scrutiny. North Carolina

       Instant Runoff Voting Pilot Program.
      </b> - Session Laws 2006-192, s. 1(a) and (b), provides: "(a) The State Board of Elections shall select local jurisdictions in which to conduct a pilot program during the 2007 and 2008 elections for local offices using instant
                    runoff voting. The State Board shall select:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Up to 10 cities for the 2007 elections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Up to 10 counties for the 2008 elections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In selecting those local jurisdictions, the State Board shall seek diversity of population size, regional location, and demographic composition. The pilot shall be conducted only with the concurrence of the county board of elections that conducts elections
                    for the local jurisdiction. If a city is selected that has voters in more than one county, the concurrence of all the county boards of elections that conduct that city's elections is required. The pilot program shall consist of using
                    instant runoff voting as the method for determining the winner or winners of a partisan primary or a nonpartisan election that normally uses nonpartisan election and runoff or nonpartisan primary and election. Instant runoff voting
                    may also be used to determine results in an election where nonpartisan plurality elections are normally used, but only if the governing board of the local jurisdiction concurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "As used in this section, 'instant runoff voting' means a system in which voters rank up to three of the candidates by order of preference, first, second, or third. If the candidate with the most first-choice votes receives the threshold of victory of
                    the first-choice votes, that candidate wins. If no candidate receives the threshold of victory of first-choice votes, the two candidates with the greatest number of first-choice votes advance to a second round of counting. In this
                    round, each ballot counts as a vote for whichever of the two final candidates is ranked highest by the voter. The candidate with the most votes in the second round wins the election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The threshold of victory of first-choice votes for a partisan primary shall be forty percent (40%) plus one vote. The threshold of victory for a nonpartisan election and runoff or nonpartisan primary and election shall be a majority of the vote. The
                    threshold of victory in a contest that normally uses nonpartisan plurality shall be determined by the State Board with the concurrence of the county board of elections and the local governing board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If more than one seat is to be filled in the same race, the voter votes the same way as if one seat were to be filled. The counting is the same as when one seat is to be filled, with one or two rounds as needed, except that counting is done separately
                    for each seat to be filled. The first counting results in the first winner. Then the second count proceeds without the name of the first winner. This process results in the second winner. For each additional seat to be filled, an additional
                    count is done without the names of the candidates who have already won.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Other details of instant runoff voting are as described in House Bill 1024 (First Edition) of the 2005 Regular Session of the General Assembly, with modifications the State Board deems necessary, in primaries and/or elections for city offices, for county
                    offices, or for both. Those modifications may include giving the voter more than three choices in case of multi-seat contests. The State Board shall not use instant runoff voting in a primary or election for an office unless the entire
                    electorate for the office uses the same method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) The State Board of Elections shall closely monitor the pilot program established in this section and report its findings and recommendations to the 2007 General Assembly."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2008-150, s. 3(a), as amended by Session Laws 2009-541, s. 30(a), provides: "The State Board of Elections is authorized to select elections for offices of local government in which to use instant runoff voting in up to 10 local jurisdictions
                    in each of the following years: 2009, 2010, and 2011. The selection of jurisdictions and administration of instant runoff voting shall follow the provisions of Section 1(a) of Session Law 2006-192, except that the local governing board
                    that is the subject of the election must approve participation in the pilot and must hold at least one public hearing on the pilot before approving it, with notice of the hearing published at least 10 days before the hearing. The local
                    governing board also must agree to cooperate with the county board of elections and the Board in the development and implementation of a plan to educate candidates and voters about how to use the runoff voting method. In a multiseat
                    contest, the Board shall modify the method used for instant runoff voting in single-seat contests to apply its essential principles suitably to that election. In the case of a board of education election where the 'local governing
                    board' must be asked to authorize instant runoff voting because nonpartisan plurality elections are normally used, the 'local governing board' is the board of education itself. If instant runoff voting is used in place of the nonpartisan
                    election and runoff method as described in G.S. 163-293, the county board of elections, with the approval of the local governing board, may hold the election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The State Board
                    of Elections, in consultation with the School of Government at the University of North Carolina, shall by January 1, 2009, develop for the pilot program authorized in this section goals, standards consistent with general election law,
                    and criteria for implementation and evaluation. The pilot program shall be conducted according to those goals, standards, and criteria. The term 'ranked choice voting' shall have the same meaning as, and may be used as a substitute
                    for, the term 'instant runoff voting' in describing the pilot."

                    of and conduct a public hearing to satisfy the requirement before January 1, 2010."

                    In cities conducting partisan elections, any qualified voter who seeks to have his name printed on the regular municipal election ballot as an unaffiliated candidate may do so in the manner provided in G.S. 163-122, except that the petitions and affidavits
                    shall be filed not later than 12:00 noon on the Friday preceding the seventh Saturday before the election, and the petitions shall be signed by a number of qualified voters of the municipality equal to at least one and a half percent
                    (1.5%) of the whole number of voters qualified to vote in the municipal election according to the voter registration records of the State Board of Elections as of January 1 of the year in which the general municipal election is held.
                    A person whose name appeared on the ballot in a primary election is not eligible to have his name placed on the regular municipal election ballot as an unaffiliated candidate for the same office in that year. The Board of Elections
                    shall examine and verify the signatures on the petition, and shall certify only the names of signers who are found to be qualified registered voters in the municipality. Provided that in the case where a qualified voter seeks to have
                    his name printed on the regular municipal election ballot as an unaffiliated candidate for election from an election district within the municipality, the petition shall be signed by one and a half percent (1.5%) of the voters qualified
                    to vote for that office.

The renumbering and relettering of subsections and subdivisions, etc.,
                    within each section done in 2017 has been retained except in a few cases in which the original Chapter 163 section had no compound subsection or subdivision numbers (i.e., (a1), (1a), etc.) but retaining the 2017 renumbering and relettering
                    would result in such a number because of subsections or subdivisions being un-repealed. These changes are not shown on this chart.
