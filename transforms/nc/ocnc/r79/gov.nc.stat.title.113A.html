                    Session Laws 2010-31, s. 9.10(a), provides: "The General Assembly finds that strengthening research and development efforts on renewable energy sources is critical to North Carolina's environment and economy, and that recent events resulting from the
                    British Petroleum oil spill amplify the need for North Carolina's innovators and scientists to enhance their efforts to develop sustainable energy sources and technologies that do not threaten the health and well-being of the State's
                    waters, sensitive lands, and residents. In order to provide opportunities for research into tidal, wave, and other ocean-based sources of alternative energy, the University of North Carolina Coastal Studies Institute shall form a consortium
                    with the Colleges of Engineering at North Carolina State University, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte to study the capture of energy from ocean waves. The
                    Coastal Studies Institute shall be designated the lead agency in coordinating these efforts. Funding appropriated by this act shall be used by university scientists to conceptualize, design, construct, operate, and market new and innovative
                    technologies designed to harness and maximize the energy of the ocean in order to provide substantial power generation for the State. Funding may be used to leverage federal or private research funding for this purpose, but may not
                    be used to purchase and utilize technology that has already been developed by others unless that technology is a critical component to North Carolina's research efforts. Wave energy technologies developed and used for this research
                    may be attached to or staged from an existing State-owned structure located in the ocean waters of the State, and data generated by these technologies shall be available at this structure for public education and awareness. It is the
                    intent of the General Assembly that North Carolina become the focal point for marine-based ocean research collaborations involving the nation's public and private universities."

         Method of Quality Control for Toxic Waste Site.
        </b> - There is no requirement under this section for the State to set forth in an environmental impact statement how quality control of a toxic waste disposal site will be done. The reporting requirements of this Article
                            insure that it is done. Warren County v. North Carolina, 528 F. Supp. 276 (E.D.N.C. 1981).

                            Minimum Criteria. - Appellate court rejected property owners' argument that a town improperly initiated proceedings to condemn their property before the North Carolina Department of Transportation completed an environmental impact study on a proposal
                            to widen and improve a road because the total right-of-way sought was less than 10 acres and it fell under the "minimum criteria" standards set forth in N.C. Admin. Code. Town of Highlands v. Hendricks,

                            and raising due process claims, because the characterization of both sites became virtually complete while appeal of the trial court was pending, plaintiff's claim seeking to require the preparation by the defendants of a precharacterization
                            environmental impact statement was moot. Richmond County v. North Carolina Low-level Radioactive Waste Mgt. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 700, 425 S.E.2d 468, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 77</cite>,

                    of surface water resources and their availability and maintenance in the State, including issues related to the transfer of water from one river basin to another, the withdrawal of water for consumptive use, and the accuracy and tolerance
                    of equipment used to measure the flow of water transferred from one river basin to another river basin. The Commission shall evaluate the benefits of establishing formal and informal procedures for negotiating transfers of water from
                    one river basin to another. The Commission shall also study and recommend measures to: (i) ensure that the purposes of the Regional Water Supply Planning Act of 1971, as set out in G.S. 162A-21, are fulfilled; (ii) provide for a comprehensive
                    system for regulating surface water withdrawals for consumptive and nonconsumptive uses; (iii) provide for the establishment of a statewide plan for water resources development projects; (iv) provide for adequate resources for the
                    Department so that it may develop and implement a comprehensive approach to water resources management; (v) ensure that all State laws regulating water resources are consistent with and fully integrated into the comprehensive system
                    for regulating surface water withdrawals and the statewide plan for water resources development projects; and (vi) ensure that potential interstate conflicts related to water resources are avoided or minimized. In the conduct of this
                    study, the Environmental Review Commission may employ independent consultants as provided in G.S. 120-32.02 and G.S. 120-70.44. The Environmental Review Commission may submit interim reports to the 2008 and 2009 regular sessions of
                    the General Assembly and shall submit a final report of its findings and recommendations, including any legislative proposals, to the General Assembly on or before 1 October 2010."

                    Participation in the Express Review Pilot Program is voluntary, and the program is to become supported by the fees determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources shall determine
                    the project applications to review under the Express Review Pilot Program from those who request to participate in the Pilot Program. The Express Review Pilot Program may be applied to any one or all of the permits, approvals, or certifications
                    in the following programs: the erosion and sedimentation control program, the coastal management program, and the water quality programs, including water quality certifications and stormwater management. The Express Review Pilot Program

                    would otherwise apply by statute or rule for that particular permit or certification. Additional fees, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the original permit application fee under this section, may be charged for subsequent reviews
                    due to the insufficiency of the permit applications. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources may establish the procedure by which the amount of the fees under this subsection is determined, and the fees and procedures are

                    Session Laws 2010-31, s. 9.10(a), provides: "The General Assembly finds that strengthening research and development efforts on renewable energy sources is critical to North Carolina's environment and economy, and that recent events resulting from the
                    British Petroleum oil spill amplify the need for North Carolina's innovators and scientists to enhance their efforts to develop sustainable energy sources and technologies that do not threaten the health and well-being of the State's
                    waters, sensitive lands, and residents. In order to provide opportunities for research into tidal, wave, and other ocean-based sources of alternative energy, the University of North Carolina Coastal Studies Institute shall form a consortium
                    with the Colleges of Engineering at North Carolina State University, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte to study the capture of energy from ocean waves. The
                    Coastal Studies Institute shall be designated the lead agency in coordinating these efforts. Funding appropriated by this act shall be used by university scientists to conceptualize, design, construct, operate, and market new and innovative
                    technologies designed to harness and maximize the energy of the ocean in order to provide substantial power generation for the State. Funding may be used to leverage federal or private research funding for this purpose, but may not
                    be used to purchase and utilize technology that has already been developed by others unless that technology is a critical component to North Carolina's research efforts. Wave energy technologies developed and used for this research
                    may be attached to or staged from an existing State-owned structure located in the ocean waters of the State, and data generated by these technologies shall be available at this structure for public education and awareness. It is the
                    intent of the General Assembly that North Carolina become the focal point for marine-based ocean research collaborations involving the nation's public and private universities."

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The sedimentation of streams, lakes and other waters of this State constitutes a major pollution problem. Sedimentation occurs from the erosion or depositing of soil and other materials into the waters, principally from construction sites and road maintenance.
                    The continued development of this State will result in an intensification of pollution through sedimentation unless timely and appropriate action is taken. Control of erosion and sedimentation is deemed vital to the public interest
                    and necessary to the public health and welfare, and expenditures of funds for erosion and sedimentation control programs shall be deemed for a public purpose. It is the purpose of this Article to provide for the creation, administration,
                    and enforcement of a program and for the adoption of minimal mandatory standards which will permit development of this State to continue with the least detrimental effects from pollution by sedimentation. In recognition of the desirability
                    of early coordination of sedimentation control planning, it is the intention of the General Assembly that preconstruction conferences be held among the affected parties, subject to the availability of staff.

                        Assessment of Civil Penalty Held Constitutional. - N.C. Const., Art. IV,
                        <span class="s1">
    §
   </span> 3, did not prohibit the legislature from conferring on the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development (now Environment, Health, and Natural Resources) the power to exercise discretion in
                        determining civil penalties within an authorized range; plenary guiding standards existed to check the exercise of the Department's discretion in its assessment of civil penalties in varying amounts, commensurate with the seriousness
                        of the violations of this Article, the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 373</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 30

                        Application to Activities Occurring Prior to Effective Date of Article. - Application of this Article, the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973, to prevent erosion and sedimentation of public waters resulting from "land-disturbing" activities which
                        occurred before the Article became effective does not constitute an unlawful retroactive application of the Article, since the purpose of the Article is to control erosion and sedimentation rather than only land-disturbing activities.

                        materials into water, and it was clear that even a "land-disturbing activity" required an element of deposition into a body of water, no sediment was deposited into a body of water and the second requirement of a land-disturbing

                        Applicability of Article to Activities Occurring Before Article and Regulations Became Effective. - To accomplish the purpose of this Article, the Article and the regulations enacted pursuant to it may be applied to land-disturbing activities which occurred
                        before the Article and regulations became effective. Cox v. State ex rel. Summers, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 612, 344 S.E.2d 808, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 413</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Under this Article and the regulations enacted pursuant thereto, the developers of land, who still owned the roadway over which lot owners had an easement, could be held responsible for permanent erosion and sediment control measures in that roadway,
                        even though the land-disturbing activity of the developers in developing the land occurred before the effective date of the regulations in question. Cox v. State ex rel. Summers, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite>                        612, 344 S.E.2d 808, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 413</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 592 (1986).

                        Scope. - G.S. 113A-54(b) authorizes the Sedimentation Control Commission to adopt rules and regulations for the control of erosion and sedimentation resulting from land-disturbing activities, and this authority is not limited to circumstances where sedimentation
                        actually reaches a waterway; consistent with the authority set forth in G.S. 113A-54(b), the Commission has adopted rules that regulate all land-disturbing activities, with some exceptions, and the rules promulgated pursuant to
                        the authority set forth by G.S. 113A-54(b) are implicated regardless of whether G.S. 113A-57(1), limiting land-disturbing activities, is applicable. Williams v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                        121, 641 S.E.2d 391 (2007).

                        compliance or noncompliance with the plan, this Article, or any rules adopted pursuant to this Article. Except as provided in subsection (a1) of this section, if the applicant is not the owner of the land to be disturbed, the draft

                        shall approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a draft erosion and sedimentation control plan for those land-disturbing activities for which prior plan approval is required within 30 days of receipt. The Commission shall
                        condition approval of a draft erosion and sedimentation control plan upon the applicant's compliance with federal and State water quality laws, regulations, and rules. Failure to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove
                        a completed draft erosion and sedimentation control plan within 30 days of receipt shall be deemed approval of the plan. If the Commission disapproves a draft erosion and sedimentation control plan or a revised erosion and sedimentation
                        control plan, it must state in writing the specific reasons that the plan was disapproved. Failure to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a revised erosion and sedimentation control plan within 15 days of receipt
                        shall be deemed approval of the plan. The Commission may establish an expiration date for erosion and sedimentation control plans approved under this Article.

                        Legislative Intent. - Had the General assembly also wished subdivisions (1) and (2) to contain a one acre requirement they could have added it to these sections. McHugh v. North Carolina Dep't of Envtl., Health &amp; Natural Resources,
                        <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 485 S.E.2d 861 (1997).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Applicability of One Acre Requirement. - Although subdivisions (3) and (4) contain a requirement that more than one acre of land must be uncovered before a violation will be found, the one acre requirement does not apply to subsections (1) and (2). McHugh
                        v. North Carolina Dep't of Envtl., Health &amp; Natural Resources, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 485 S.E.2d 861 (1997).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a landowner sued a developer and a land grader for violating the North Carolina Sedimentation Pollution Control Act (SPCA), it was error for a trial court to rule, as a matter of law, that the developer and grader could not be liable under the SPCA
                        because the lot on which they conducted their activities, of which the landowner complained, was smaller than one acre, because while the provisions of G.S. 113A-57(3) and (4) only applied to one acre or more of land, G.S. 113A-57(1)
                        and (2) contained no such limitation. Williams v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 121, 641 S.E.2d 391 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While G.S. 113A-57(3) and (4), placing conditions on land-disturbing activity, expressly condition their application on land-disturbing activity that disturbs more than one acre, G.S. 113A-57(1) and (2) contain no such limitation, as G.S. 113A-57(2),
                        which sets out a standard for "graded slopes and fills," does not include any acreage requirement, and G.S. 113A-57(1) applies to any land-disturbing activity "in proximity to a lake or natural watercourse" without regard to the
                        size of the land area that is disturbed. Williams v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 121, 641 S.E.2d 391 (2007).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Application to Activities Occurring Prior to Effective Date of Article. - Application of this Article, the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973, to prevent erosion and sedimentation of public waters resulting from "land-disturbing" activities which
                        occurred before the Article became effective does not constitute an unlawful retroactive application of the Article, since the purpose of the Article is to control erosion and sedimentation rather than only land-disturbing activities.

                    <p>
                        Ownership of Land. - This section does not require that the party causing the disturbance has to own more than one acre of the land being uncovered. Midway Grading Co. v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't, Health &amp; Natural Resources,
                        <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 473 S.E.2d 20 (1996).

                        Activities That Are Not Temporary and Minimal. - In a case in which two property owners and an environmental group appealed a decision by a trial court, they were correct that the trial court erred in concluding that the land-disturbing activities by
                        a country club owner in building a nine-hole golf course were temporary and minimal and thus authorized by G.S. 113A-57(1). The trial court's finding that the country club owner would only be conducting a land-disturbing activity
                        while doing construction in the trout buffer was not supported by competent evidence in the record. Hensley v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res., <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 685 S.E.2d

                        Improper Grant of Variance. - In a case in which two property owners and an environmental group appealed a decision by a trial court, they were correct that the trial court erred in concluding that the land-disturbing activities by a country club owner
                        in building a nine-hole golf course were temporary and minimal and thus authorized by G.S. 113A-57(1). Pursuant to G.S. 113A-57(1) and 15A N.C. Admin. Code 4A.0105(26), the land-disturbing activities conducted by the country club
                        owner during construction of a nine-hole golf course were not minimal, and no variance should have been granted by the N.C. Sedimentation Control Commission. Hensley v. N.C. Dep't of Env't &amp; Natural Res.,

                                assessed under this subsection for all violations associated with the land-disturbing activity for which the erosion and sedimentation control plan is required is twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).

                                The Secretary or a local government that administers an erosion and sedimentation control program approved under G.S. 113A-60 shall determine the amount of the civil penalty and shall notify the person who is assessed the civil penalty of the amount of
                                the penalty, the reason for assessing the penalty, the option available to that person to request a remission of the civil penalty under G.S. 113A-64.2, the date of the deadline for that person to make the remission request
                                regarding this particular penalty, and, when that person has not been assessed any civil penalty under this section for any previous violation, the date of the deadline for that person to abate continuing environmental
                                damage resulting from the violation in order to be subject to the maximum cumulative total civil penalty under subdivision (1) of this subsection. The notice of assessment shall be served by any means authorized under G.S.
                                1A-1. A notice of assessment by the Secretary shall direct the violator to either pay the assessment or contest the assessment within 30 days by filing a petition for a contested case under Article 3 of Chapter 150B of
                                the General Statutes. If a violator does not pay a civil penalty assessed by the Secretary within 30 days after it is due, the Department shall request the Attorney General to institute a civil action to recover the amount
                                of the assessment. A notice of assessment by a local government shall direct the violator to either pay the assessment or contest the assessment within 30 days by filing a petition for hearing with the local government
                                as directed by procedures within the local ordinances or regulations adopted to establish and enforce the erosion and sedimentation control program. If a violator does not pay a civil penalty assessed by a local government
                                within 30 days after it is due, the local government may institute a civil action to recover the amount of the assessment. The civil action may be brought in the superior court of any county where the violation occurred
                                or the violator's residence or principal place of business is located. A civil action must be filed within three years of the date the assessment was due. An assessment that is not contested is due when the violator is
                                served with a notice of assessment. An assessment that is contested is due at the conclusion of the administrative and judicial review of the assessment.

                        Lack of Formally Adopted Guidelines Did Not Affect Substantial Right. - No substantial right of petitioners would have been prejudiced by a civil penalty based upon the secretary's application of the stated penalty factors absent formally adopted guidelines;
                        petitioners did not have a substantial right to calculate in advance, to the penny, whether the financial benefits of violating this Article would outweigh the possible expense of civil penalties. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty

                        Defendant Entitled to Jury Trial in Civil Action under Subdivision (a)(2). - Where the Attorney General, on behalf of the Department, filed action for the collection of civil penalties under subdivision (a)(2) of this section and for the imposition of
                        an order enforcing compliance with this Article and an injunction under G.S. 113A-66, the action was a civil action, not one for review of a final agency decision, and defendant, who requested a jury trial in his answer, was therefore
                        entitled to jury trial on all factual issues. State ex rel. Lee v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 284 S.E.2d 572 (1981).

                        This Section Provides Sufficient Guidance for Promulgation of Penalty Factors. - This Article in general, and this section in particular, provides sufficient guidance for department's promulgation of penalty factors based on its experience and expertise
                        in enforcing the Article; it is enough if general policies and standards have been articulated which are sufficient to provide direction to an administrative body possessing the expertise to adapt the legislative goals to varying
                        circumstances. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 373 S.E.2d 572 (1988), rev'd on other grounds,

                    <p>
                        Penalty Factors Reasonably Related to Administration and Enforcement of Article. - Department's assessment was not based upon the secretary's "absolute" discretion, but instead upon numerous penalty factors which were reasonably related to the Article's
                        administration and enforcement and resulted in a fair and reasoned penalty assessment.

                    <p>
                        Penalty Held Not Arbitrary or Capricious. - Where the penalty assessed by the Department of Natural Resources and Community Development (now Environment, Health, and Natural Resources) was within the statutory limits provided in this section, and the
                        record evidenced the secretary's reasoned weighing of the penalty factors announced in 15 N.C. Adm. Code 4C.006, which were reasonably related to the Article's administration and enforcement, the department's assessment of the
                        monetary penalty was not arbitrary and capricious. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 373 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        The department's assessment was not rendered arbitrary and capricious because it was based on penalty factors set forth in a properly adopted administrative regulation rather than in this section itself. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations

                        Intervention Not Allowed. - While the intervenors had a general interest in an underlying issue, whether the property owner was exempt from the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973, they did not have a direct interest in the civil penalty imposed
                        by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, which was the property or transaction at issue pursuant to G.S. 113A-64(a)(5); accordingly, the ALJ erred by granting intervention as of right. Holly Ridge

                        Applicable Statute of Limitations. - The one-year statute of limitations contained in G.S. 1-54(2) does not apply to the assessment of a civil penalty by the Secretary of the Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources (now the Secretary of
                        Environment and Natural Resources) pursuant to subdivision (a) because the assessment of the penalty is not an "action or proceeding" as those terms are used in G.S. 1-54. Ocean Hill Joint Venture v. North Carolina Dep't of Environment,

                    The Secretary or a local government that administers a local erosion and sedimentation control program approved under G.S. 113A-60 may require a person who engaged in a land-disturbing activity and failed to retain sediment generated by the activity,
                    as required by G.S. 113A-57(3), to restore the waters and land affected by the failure so as to minimize the detrimental effects of the resulting pollution by sedimentation. This authority is in addition to any other civil or criminal
                    penalty or injunctive relief authorized under this Article.

                        Requirement of Deposit Into Body of Water. - Defendant was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim under the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act (SPCA), because G.S. 113A-51 provided that sedimentation result from the erosion or depositing of
                        materials into water, and it was clear that even a "land-disturbing activity" required an element of deposition into a body of water, no sediment was deposited into a body of water and the second requirement of a land-disturbing
                        activity under the SPCA was that it may cause or contribute to sedimentation. Applewood Props., LLC v. New South Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 725 S.E.2d 360 (2012), modified

                        Violation Required for Standing. - Before an injured person can have standing to bring a civil action pursuant to G.S. 113A-66 of the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, the defendant must have been cited for a violation of a law, rule, ordinance, order,
                        or erosion and sedimentation control plan. "Notices of Noncompliance" were insufficient to give an owner standing. Applewood Props., LLC v. New South Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">366 N.C. 518</cite>,

                        and an injunction under this section, the action was a civil action, not one for review of a final agency decision, and defendant, who requested a jury trial in his answer, was therefore entitled to jury trial on all factual issues.

                    a vital public purpose and a proper governmental function and that declines in federal funding and dredging activity have significantly and adversely impacted the ability of the federal government to maintain these channels in a timely
                    manner. The resulting deterioration in these channels damages the significant portion of the economy of the State's coastal regions that is dependent on the use of the navigation channels by watercraft. Therefore, it is the policy
                    of the State to support and, when necessary to meet the public purposes set forth in this subsection, to supplement federal maintenance of these navigation channels. For purposes of this section, "shallow draft navigation channel"

                    maintenance of shallow draft navigation channels located throughout the State. For purposes of this section, Oregon Inlet Task Force refers to the advisory body initially appointed by the Dare County Commission at its January 22, 2013,
                    meeting, as subsequently revised by the Commission. The Local Partner shall delegate by resolution any of its delegable duties under this section to the Task Force. The Task Force shall coordinate the use of the dredge funded by this
                    section to ensure that dredging projects for all shallow draft navigation channels located in waters of the State are completed in an expeditious and timely manner.

An eligible
                    entity responding to the RFP shall submit to the Local Partner an application within 30 days in the manner and accompanied by such information as the Local Partner may require. The Local Partner shall select a private partner no later

                    of Agreement described in subdivision (e)(2) of this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) To ensure that public funds are used only to carry out public purposes, the private entity shall provide, as service repayment on the forgivable loan, dredging of the State's shallow draft navigation channels at a cost-savings between the usual and
                    customary rate for dredging services of this type (as determined by the Local Partner in consultation with the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Environmental Quality) and a lower rate specified for the dredging
                    in the loan agreement. The agreement shall account for cost-savings that total fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) over the term of the agreement. The Local Partner shall annually forgive that portion of the loan and any interest
                    accrued on the loan based on the provision of reduced cost dredging services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) At the option of the Loan Parties, the agreement may provide for use of the dredge to undertake supplemental dredging projects within the State at the usual and customary rate charged for such projects if the Local Partner determines that the dredge
                    has capacity to undertake additional work. The Loan Parties shall prioritize supplemental dredging projects for local governments over supplemental dredging projects for private entities. Supplemental dredging projects authorized by
                    this subdivision shall not be credited toward repayment of the forgivable loan under subdivision (2) of this subsection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) If the private entity does not provide cost-savings on dredging services at the State's shallow draft navigation channels in an amount equal to fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) over the term of the Agreement, the owner of the dredge shall repay
                    the Local Partner within 90 days of the termination date of the Agreement in an amount equal to the remaining service repayment obligation plus any interest accrued on the remaining obligation. The Local Partner shall forward the funds
                    repaid under this subdivision to the Office of State Budget and Management to be credited to the Shallow Draft Navigation Channel Dredging and Aquatic Weed Fund.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(e) The Department of Environmental Quality, the Local Partner, and the private entity shall do all of the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Plan and allocate responsibilities for any permits, authorizations, or certifications necessary for operation of the dredge for the purposes described in this section. The Local Partner and the private entity shall structure ownership and operation
                    of the dredge in a manner that allows work to be conducted to the maximum extent possible under general permits or through amendments to existing individual permits in order to minimize the expense and delay associated with permitting
                    of dredge operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Upon request of the Local Partner, negotiate a Memorandum of Agreement or an amendment to the existing Memorandum of Agreement between the Department and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to incorporate in-kind contributions through the activities
                    of the dredge acquired under this section into existing work plans for maintenance work on shallow draft navigation channels of the State.

                        Balancing of Costs and Benefits Not Appropriate. - In enacting the Coastal Area Management Act, the General Assembly has established its priorities through a comprehensive regulatory scheme, completely prohibiting, e.g., construction of bulkheads and
                        other stabilization structures in wetlands, or the filling of wetlands therein; in that context, it is inappropriate, under the statute and the rules promulgated pursuant to it, for the courts to attempt to balance the private

                    In recent years the coastal area has been subjected to increasing pressures which are the result of the often-conflicting needs of a society expanding in industrial development, in population, and in the recreational aspirations of its citizens. Unless
                    these pressures are controlled by coordinated management, the very features of the coast which make it economically, esthetically, and ecologically rich will be destroyed. The General Assembly therefore finds that an immediate and
                    pressing need exists to establish a comprehensive plan for the protection, preservation, orderly development, and management of the coastal area of North Carolina.

                    In the implementation of the coastal area management plan, the public's opportunity to enjoy the physical, esthetic, cultural, and recreational qualities of the natural shorelines of the State shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible; water
                    resources shall be managed in order to preserve and enhance water quality and to provide optimum utilization of water resources; land resources shall be managed in order to guide growth and development and to minimize damage to the
                    natural environment; and private property rights shall be preserved in accord with the Constitution of this State and of the United States.

                        Commission Has Been Given Adequate Guidelines. - The goals, policies and criteria outlined in this section and G.S. 113A-113 provide the members of the Coastal Resources Commission with an adequate notion of the legislative parameters within which they
                        are to operate in the exercise of their delegated powers. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

                        Substantial Private Property Interest Outweighed Competing Public Interests. - Trial court did not err in reversing the decision of the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission to deny a request for a variance by the manager of a homeowners' association
                        because the manager's substantial private property interest outweighed the competing public interests; if sandbags were removed, the manager's condos faced potential destruction from erosion, and the manager proposed a new beach
                        renourishment solution, and if the solution was successful, it would not need the sandbags. Riggings Homeowners, Inc. v. Coastal Res. Comm'n of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 747 S.E.2d

                        Commission's Decision Consistent with Goals of the Act. - Trial court did not err in affirming the decision of the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission and in applying a 60-foot setback because the plain meaning of the setback rules was that the
                        setback criteria was based on the size of the individual building or structure involved; the Commission's decision to base the required setback for a development on the size of each building or structure is consistent with the
                        goals of the Coastal Area Management Act of 1974. Busik v. N.C. Coastal Res. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 753 S.E.2d 326 (2013).

                    into the Ocean Erodible Area of Environmental Concern. If the Commission deems action is necessary to preserve, protect, and balance the economic and natural resources adjacent to inlets, the Commission shall consider the elimination
                    of the inlet hazard boxes; the development of shoreline management strategies that take into account short- and long-term inlet shoreline oscillation and variation, including erosion rates and setback factors; the development of standards
                    that account for the lateral movement of inlets and their impact on adjacent development and habitat; and consideration of how new and existing development standards, as well as existing and proposed development, are impacted by historical
                    and ongoing beach and inlet management techniques, including dredging, beach fill, and engineered structures such as groins and jetties. As part of this study, the Commission shall collaborate with local governments and landowners
                    affected by the Commission's Inlet Hazard Areas to identify regulatory concerns and develop strategies for creating a more efficient regulatory framework. The Commission shall report its findings, including any proposed actions the

      </b> - Session Laws 2012-202, s. 4 provides: "The Coastal Resources Commission shall study the feasibility of creating a new Area of Environmental Concern for the lands adjacent to the mouth of the Cape Fear River. In studying
                    this region, which shall at least encompass the Town of Caswell Beach and the Village of Bald Head Island, the Commission shall consider the unique coastal morphologies and hydrographic conditions not found elsewhere along the coast.
                    As part of this study, the Commission shall collaborate with the Town of Caswell Beach, the Village of Bald Head Island, and landowners within and immediately adjacent to these two municipalities to identify regulatory concerns and
                    develop strategies for creating a more efficient regulatory framework. If the Commission deems action is necessary to preserve, protect, and balance the economic and natural resources of this region, the Commission shall work to eliminate
                    overlapping Areas of Environmental Concern in these areas and instead incorporate appropriate development standards into one single Area of Environmental Concern unique to this location. The Commission shall report its findings, including
                    any proposed actions the Commission deems appropriate, to the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, the Governor, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Environmental

                    into the Ocean Erodible Area of Environmental Concern. If the Commission deems action is necessary to preserve, protect, and balance the economic and natural resources adjacent to inlets, the Commission shall consider the elimination
                    of the inlet hazard boxes; the development of shoreline management strategies that take into account short- and long-term inlet shoreline oscillation and variation, including erosion rates and setback factors; the development of standards

                        There was no justiciable controversy in a declaratory judgment action on the question of whether there was an unconstitutional taking of the plaintiffs' land as the result of the designation of their land as an interim area of environmental concern where,
                        at the time the case was tried, the plaintiffs had no occasion to seek development permits, variances, or exemptions from coverage, and could only speculate as to the effect the act would have on the usefulness and value of their
                        specific plots of land. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978), decided under former G.S. 113A-114.

                        The designation of land as an interim area of environmental concern does not subject development to a permit requirement; it merely requires the developer to give the State 60 days notice before undertaking the proposed activity. Adams v. North Carolina

                    preference to nonstructural responses to erosion, including relocation of threatened structures, beach nourishment, inlet relocation, and the temporary use of sandbags for short-term stabilization; and

                    "Whereas, the use of terminal groins on inlet beaches may adversely impact the value and enjoyment of adjacent properties, damage the public beach, obstruct public access to the beach and to navigable waters, and result in increased erosion to adjacent

                <p>

                    of up to four terminal groins under certain conditions; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, it is reasonable to authorize the Coastal Resources Commission to permit the construction of a terminal groin under the pilot program if the Commission finds that (i) structures or infrastructure are imminently threatened by erosion and that
                    nonstructural approaches to erosion control are impractical; (ii) the terminal groin will be accompanied by a concurrent beach fill project; (iii) construction and maintenance of the terminal groin will not result in significant adverse
                    impacts to private property or to the public recreational beach; (iv) the terminal groin will be managed pursuant to an inlet management plan; and (v) there are sufficient financial resources to cover the costs associated with the

                    issue permits in any city within said county that disclaims its intent to issue permits or fails to submit a letter of intent. Provided, however, should any city or county fail to become a permit-letting agency for any reason, but
                    shall later express its desire to do so, it shall be permitted by the Coastal Resources Commission to qualify as such an agency by following the procedure herein set forth for qualification in the first instance.

                    British Petroleum oil spill amplify the need for North Carolina's innovators and scientists to enhance their efforts to develop sustainable energy sources and technologies that do not threaten the health and well-being of the State's
                    waters, sensitive lands, and residents. In order to provide opportunities for research into tidal, wave, and other ocean-based sources of alternative energy, the University of North Carolina Coastal Studies Institute shall form a consortium
                    with the Colleges of Engineering at North Carolina State University, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte to study the capture of energy from ocean waves. The

                    technologies designed to harness and maximize the energy of the ocean in order to provide substantial power generation for the State. Funding may be used to leverage federal or private research funding for this purpose, but may not
                    be used to purchase and utilize technology that has already been developed by others unless that technology is a critical component to North Carolina's research efforts. Wave energy technologies developed and used for this research
                    may be attached to or staged from an existing State-owned structure located in the ocean waters of the State, and data generated by these technologies shall be available at this structure for public education and awareness. It is the

                        Separation of Powers. - Trial court did not err in determining the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission's actions did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; since subsection (a) explicitly contemplates the Commission's issuance of variances,
                        it is self-evident that judicial authority to rule on variance requests is reasonably necessary to accomplish the Commission's statutory purpose. Riggings Homeowners, Inc. v. Coastal Res. Comm'n of N.C.
                        <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 747 S.E.2d 301 (2013).

                        Commission does not Need to Make Reasonable Use Determination. - Trial court did not err in determining the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission did not need to make a "reasonable use" determination; the amendment to the statute shifted the burden
                        of proving the four variance factors to petitioners, and consequently, the Commission does not need to make a "reasonable use" determination before denying a variance request. Riggings Homeowners, Inc. v. Coastal Res. Comm'n of
                        N.C. <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 747 S.E.2d 301 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Estoppel from Challenging Regulatory Scheme. - Plaintiffs' acknowledgment in their complaint that they sought, received and took full advantage of a variance for an erosion control structure pursuant to the regulatory scheme which they were challenging
                        precluded them from asserting claim that the hardened structure rules and regulatory scheme under which the rules were promulgated were invalid and unconstitutional. Shell Island Homeowners Ass'n v. Tomlinson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 217, 517 S.E.2d 406 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Substantial Private Property Interest Outweighed Competing Public Interests. - Trial court did not err in reversing the decision of the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission to deny a request for a variance by the manager of a homeowners' association
                        because the manager's substantial private property interest outweighed the competing public interests; if sandbags were removed, the manager's condos faced potential destruction from erosion, and the manager proposed a new beach
                        renourishment solution, and if the solution was successful, it would not need the sandbags. Riggings Homeowners, Inc. v. Coastal Res. Comm'n of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 747 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Unnecessary Hardships Established. - Trial court did not err in reversing the decision of the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission to deny a request for a variance filed by the manager of a homeowners' association because the manager suffered unnecessary
                        hardships; the Commission improperly focused its analysis on the property-owner rather than the property, and the manager's previous permit and variances were immaterial to its "unnecessary hardships" analysis. Riggings Homeowners,
                        Inc. v. Coastal Res. Comm'n of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 747 S.E.2d 301 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Substantial Evidence Supported Variance Denial. - As a decision by the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission, denying property owners' request under G.S. 113A-120.1(a) for a variance from an erosion setback requirement, was supported by substantial
                        evidence and was not arbitrary or capricious, a trial court erred when it failed to affirm it under the whole record test. Midgett v. N. Carolina Coastal Res. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite>                        420, - S.E.2d - (June 7, 2011).

                        Standard of Review. - Trial court appropriately applied de novo review to the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission's first variance factor determination because the only issue was whether the manager of a homeowners' association suffered unnecessary
                        hardships; the trial court appropriately applied the whole record test to determine whether the facts were supported by substantial evidence and de novo review to the Commission's legal determinations under the Coastal Area Management
                        Act's statutory framework. Riggings Homeowners, Inc. v. Coastal Res. Comm'n of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 630, 747 S.E.2d 301 (2013).

                        Burden of Proof. - If a party other than the applicant or Secretary is dissatisfied with the decision to issue a permit, the party may request a contested case hearing. The party requesting the hearing has the burden of alleging that the permit decision
                        is contrary to a statute or rule, of showing that the party is directly affected by the permit decision, and of showing that the party has a substantial likelihood of prevailing in a contested case. Pamlico Tar River Found., Inc.

                        or decisions are defective because of one of the six reasons stated under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba04s150B-51" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-51</a></cite>. Pamlico Tar River

                        Relevant Evidence for Entitlement to Contested Case Hearing. - The failure to include evidence supporting Division of Coastal Management's (DCM's) decision to issue a permit in the DCM record is not relevant on the issue before Coastal Resources Commission
                        (CRC) of whether an organization opposed to issuance of the permit was entitled to a contested case hearing. The only relevant evidence on this issue is evidence of whether there has been a violation of some substantive statute,
                        rule or regulation. Pamlico Tar River Found., Inc. v. Coastal Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 24, 404 S.E.2d 167 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Commission's Denial of Contested Case Hearing Held Contrary to Subsection (b). - Where petitioners argued that the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission (CRC) failed to comply with the procedures for adopting a temporary rule under former G.S. 150B-13,
                        vice-chairman's order was arbitrary and capricious because it required petitioners to specifically allege that the CRC either acted arbitrarily and capriciously or abused its discretion; this finding did not address the merits
                        of petitioners' claim and imposed on petitioners an additional burden that subsection (b) of this section did not require. Conservation Council v. Haste, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 411, 402

                        The General Assembly finds that there are many privately owned lots or tracts of land in close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and the coastal waters in North Carolina that have been and will be adversely affected by hazards such as erosion, flooding,
                        and storm damage. The sand dunes on many of these lots provide valuable protective functions for public and private property and serve as an integral part of the beach sand supply system. Placement of permanent substantial structures
                        on these lots will lead to increased risks of loss of life and property, increased public costs, and potential eventual encroachment of structures onto the beach.

                        The public has traditionally fully enjoyed the State's beaches and coastal waters and public access to and use of the beaches and coastal waters. The beaches provide a recreational resource of great importance to North Carolina and its citizens and this
                        makes a significant contribution to the economic well-being of the State. The General Assembly finds that the beaches and coastal waters are resources of statewide significance and have been customarily freely used and enjoyed
                        by people throughout the State. Public access to beaches and coastal waters in North Carolina is, however, becoming severely limited in some areas. Also, the lack of public parking is increasingly making the use of existing public
                        access difficult or impractical in some areas. The public interest would best be served by providing increased access to beaches and coastal waters and by making available additional public parking facilities. There is therefore,
                        a pressing need in North Carolina to establish a comprehensive program for the identification, acquisition, improvement, and maintenance of public accessways to the beaches and coastal waters.

                    Session Laws 2000-67, s. 13.9 (a), provides: "The General Assembly makes the following findings:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) North Carolina has 320 miles of ocean beach, including some of the most pristine and attractive beaches in the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) The balance between economic development and quality of life in North Carolina has made our coast one of the most desirable along the Atlantic Seaboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) North Carolina's beaches are vital to the State's tourism industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) North Carolina's beaches belong to all the State's citizens and provide recreational and economic benefits to our residents statewide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) Beach erosion can threaten the economic viability of coastal communities and can significantly affect State tax revenues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) The Atlantic Seaboard is vulnerable to hurricanes and other storms, and it is prudent to take precautions such as beach nourishment that protect and conserve the State's beaches and reduce property damage and flooding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) Beach renourishment as an erosion control method provides hurricane flood protection, enhances the attractiveness of beaches to tourists, restores habitat for turtles, shorebirds, and plants, and provides additional public access to beaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(8) Federal policy previously favored and assisted voluntary movement of structures threatened by erosion, but this assistance is no longer available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(9) Relocation of structures threatened by erosion is sometimes the best available remedy for the property owner and is in the public interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(10) Public parking and public access areas are needed for use by the general public to enable their enjoyment of North Carolina's beaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(11) Acquisition of high erosion hazard property by local or State agencies can reduce risk to citizens and property, reduce costs to insurance policyholders, improve public access to beaches and waterways, and protect the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(12) Beach nourishment projects such as those at Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach have been very successful and greatly reduced property damage during Hurricane Fran.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(13) Because local beach communities derive the primary benefits from the presence of adequate beaches, a program of beach management and restoration should not be accomplished without a commitment of local funds to combat the problem of beach erosion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(14) The State of North Carolina prohibits seawalls and hardening the shoreline to prevent destroying the public's beaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(15) Beach nourishment is encouraged by both the Coastal Resources Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a method to control beach erosion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(16) The Department of Environment and Natural Resources has statutory authority to assist local governments in financing beach nourishment projects and is the sponsor of several federal navigation projects that result in dredging beach-quality sand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(17) It is declared to be a necessary governmental responsibility to properly manage and protect North Carolina's beaches from erosion and that good planning is needed to assure a cost-effective and equitable approach to beach management and restoration,
                    and that as part of a comprehensive response to beach erosion, sound policies are needed to facilitate the ability of landowners to move threatened structures and to allow public acquisition of appropriate parcels of land for public
                    beach access."

                    Session Laws 2012-143, s. 1(f), provides: "The Revisor of Statutes shall make the conforming statutory changes necessary to reflect the renaming of the Division of Land Resources as the Division of Energy, Mineral, and Land Resources as provided in subsection
                    (e) of this section. The Codifier of Rules shall make the conforming rule changes necessary to reflect the renaming of the Division of Land Resources as the Division of Energy, Mineral, and Land Resources as provided in subsection

       Effect of Amendments.

                    Land Resources" in subdivision (a)(1).
                </p>

                    Session Laws 2015-241, s. 14.30(u), effective July 1, 2015, substituted "Department of Environmental Quality" for "Department of Environment and Natural Resources" twice in the section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2017-10, s. 4.9, effective May 4, 2017, deleted the former last two sentences of subsection (b), which read: "The Department of Environmental Quality shall revise the plan every two years and shall submit the revised plan to the General Assembly
                    no later than March 1 of each odd-numbered year. The Department may issue a supplement to the plan in even-numbered years if significant new information becomes available."

                    Session Laws 2018-142, s. 15, effective December 15, 2018, in subdivision (a)(10), substituted "access for individuals with a disability" for "handicapped access" following "beach access, including"; and in subsection (b), deleted "Environmental Quality"
                    following "information allow."

                <p>
                    The construction of tall or major buildings and structures on the ridges and higher elevations of North Carolina's mountains in an inappropriate or badly designed manner can cause unusual problems and hazards to the residents of and to visitors to the
                    mountains. Supplying water to, and disposing of the sewage from, buildings at high elevations with significant numbers of residents may infringe on the ground water rights and endanger the health of those persons living at lower elevations.
                    Providing fire protection may be difficult given the lack of water supply and pressure and the possibility that fire will be fanned by high winds. Extremes of weather can endanger buildings, structures, vehicles, and persons. Tall
                    or major buildings and structures located on ridges are a hazard to air navigation and persons on the ground and detract from the natural beauty of the mountains.

                <p>
                    The General Assembly finds that a statewide network of protected natural areas, riparian buffers, and greenways can best be accomplished through a conservation easements program. The General Assembly further finds that other public conservation and use
                    programs, such as natural area protection, beach access, trail systems, historic landscape protection, and agricultural preservation, can benefit from increased conservation tools. In this Article, the General Assembly therefore intends
                    to extend the ability of the Department of Environmental Quality to achieve these purposes and to strengthen the capability of private nonprofit land trusts to participate in land and water conservation.
