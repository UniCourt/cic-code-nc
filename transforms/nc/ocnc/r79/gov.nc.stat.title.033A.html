Most notably, for a large portion of the transactions, the father was unable to properly account for the disbursement of the funds, in violation of his duty under G.S. 33A-12(e); further, he failed to show how the trial court's findings of fact were not supported by any competent evidence.

    Court Lacked Authority to Remove Custodian
   
   - Trial court lacked jurisdiction and authority to order a father's name to be removed from custodial accounts of his children or to order that he reimburse those accounts for funds that he withdrew; pursuant to G.S. 33A-18(f), which was a part of the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, G.S.
   33A-1 et seq., that authority was initially vested in the Clerk of the Superior Court. Guerrier v. Guerrier, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 574 S.E.2d 69 (2002).

    Award of Interest Proper.
   
   - In a judgment removing the father as custodian of all accounts created under the North Carolina Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, G.S. 33A-1 et seq., an award of interest was proper because he should have been liable for the interest that would have accrued on the amount of the funds wrongfully disbursed from the accounts. If he had not improperly expended and invested the funds, the minor would have had the benefit of those funds growing in the custodial account; further, the amount of interest was appropriate, G.S. 33A-19(a).

    Award of Fees Proper Under the UTMA.
   
   - In a judgment removing the father as custodian of all accounts created under the North Carolina Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, G.S. 33A-1 et seq., an award of attorney fees was proper because the legislative history of the uniform UTMA statute indicated that custodial accounts under UTMA were to be regarded as a form of statutory trust. Thus, there existed statutory authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a03s6-21" target="_blank">G.S. 6-21(2)</a></cite> for an award of attorney's fees in an action for the removal of a custodian and for an accounting and determination of personal liability under UTMA, G.S. 33A-19(a).
